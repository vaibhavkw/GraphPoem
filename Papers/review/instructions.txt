Please complete your review using the following guidelines for the 
scored categories.

Appropriateness (1-5)
---------------------

Does this paper fit in EMNLP?

5 = Appropriate for EMNLP. (most submissions)
4 = NLP, though not typical EMNLP material.
3 = Possibly relevant to the audience, though it's not quite NLP.
2 = Only marginally relevant.
1 = Inappropriate.

Clarity (1-5)
-------------

For a reasonably well-prepared reader, is it clear what was done and why?
Is the paper well-written and well-structured?

5 = Very clear.
4 = Understandable by most readers.
3 = Mostly understandable with some effort.
2 = Important questions were hard to resolve even with effort.
1 = Much of the paper is confusing.

Originality (1-5)
-----------------

How original is the approach or problem presented in this paper? Does this
paper break new ground in topic, methodology, or insight? A paper can score
high for originality even if the results did not show a convincing benefit.

5 = Innovative: Highly original and significant new research topic,
technique, methodology, or insight.
4 = Creative: An intriguing problem, technique, or approach that is
substantially different from previous research.
3 = Respectable: A nice research contribution that represents a notable
extension of prior approaches or methodologies.
2 = Uninspiring: Obvious, or a minor improvement on familiar techniques.
1 = Significant portions have actually been done before or done better.

Soundness / Correctness (1-5)
-----------------------------

Is the technical approach sound and well-chosen? Can one trust the claims
of the paper -- are they supported by proofs or proper experiments where
the results of the experiments are correctly interpreted?

5 = The approach is sound, and the claims are convincingly supported.
4 = Generally solid, but there are some aspects of the approach or
evaluation I am not sure about.
3 = Fairly reasonable, but the main claims cannot be accepted based on the
material provided.
2 = Troublesome. Some interesting ideas, but the work needs better
justification or evaluation.
1 = Fatally flawed.

Meaningful Comparison (1-5)
---------------------------

Do the authors place their work well with respect to existing literature?
Are the references adequate? Are any experimental results meaningfully
compared with appropriate prior approaches or other baselines?

If you feel references are inadequate be sure to include the relevant
references in your comments.

5 = Comparison to prior work is superbly carried out given the space
constraints.
4 = Comparisons are mostly solid, but there are some missing references.
3 = Comparisons are weak, very hard to determine how it compares to
previous work.
2 = Only partial awareness or understanding of related work, or a flawed
empirical comparison.
1 = Little awareness of related work, or lacks necessary empirical
comparison.

Substance (1-5)
---------------

Does this paper have enough substance, or would it benefit from more ideas
or results? Note that this question mainly concerns the amount of work;
quality is evaluated in other categories.

5 = Contains more ideas or results than most publications of this length at
EMNLP.
4 = Represents an appropriate amount of content for a EMNLP paper of this
length (most submissions).
3 = Leaves open one or two natural questions that should have been pursued
within the paper.
2 = Work in progress. There are enough good ideas, but perhaps not enough
results yet.
1 = Seems thin. Not enough ideas here.

Impact of Ideas / Results (1-5)
-------------------------------

How significant is the work described? If the ideas are novel, will they
also be useful or inspirational? If the results are sound, are they also
important?

5 = Will have a significant impact on the field.
4 = Some of the ideas or results will substantially help ongoing research.
3 = Interesting but not too influential: a minor contribution that will be
used mainly for comparison.
2 = Marginally interesting. Probably will not be read or used.
1 = Will have no impact on the field.

Impact of Accompanying Software
(1-5)
-------------------------------------

If software was submitted or released along with the paper, what is the
expected impact of the software package? Will this software be valuable to
others? Does it fill an unmet need? Is it at least sufficient to replicate
or better understand the research in the paper?

5 = Enabling: The newly released software should affect other people's
choice of research or development projects to undertake.
4 = Useful: I would recommend the new software to other researchers or
developers for their ongoing work.
3 = Potentially useful: Someone might find the new software useful for
their work.
2 = Documentary: The new software useful to study or replicate the reported
research, although for other purposes they may have limited interest or
limited usability. (Still a positive rating)
1 = No usable software released.

Impact of Accompanying Dataset / Resource
(1-5)
-----------------------------------------------

If a dataset was submitted or released along with the paper, what is the
expected impact of the dataset? Will this dataset be valuable to others in
the form in which it is released? Does it fill an unmet need?

5 = Enabling: The newly released datasets should affect other people's
choice of research or development projects to undertake.
4 = Useful: I would recommend the new datasets to other researchers or
developers for their ongoing work.
3 = Potentially useful: Someone might find the new datasets useful for
their work.
2 = Documentary: The new datasets are useful to study or replicate the
reported research, although for other purposes they may have limited
interest or limited usability. (Still a positive rating)
1 = No usable datasets submitted.

Recommendation (1-5)
--------------------

There are many good submissions to EMNLP 2017; how important is it to
feature this one? Will people learn a lot by reading this paper or seeing
it presented?

In deciding on your ultimate recommendation, please think over all your
scores above. But remember that no paper is perfect, and remember that we
want a conference full of interesting, diverse, and timely work. If a paper
has some weaknesses, but you really got a lot out of it, feel free to fight
for it. If a paper is solid but you could live without it, let us know that
you would rather not see it in the conference. Remember also that the
author has about 3 weeks to address reviewer comments before the
camera-ready deadline.

Please do take the length of the submission into account. Rank short
submissions relative to other short submissions, and full-length
submissions relative to other full-length submissions. Acceptable short
submissions include small, focused contributions; works in progress;
negative results and interesting application notes.

5 = Exciting: I would fight for this paper to be accepted.
4 = Strong: I would like to see it accepted.
3 = Borderline: It has some merits but also some serious problems. I'm
ambivalent about this one.
2 = Mediocre: I would rather not see it in the conference.
1 = Poor: I would fight to have it rejected.

Reviewer Confidence (1-5)
-------------------------

5 = Positive that my evaluation is correct. I read the paper very carefully
and I am very familiar with related work.
4 = Quite sure. I tried to check the important points carefully. It's
unlikely, though conceivable, that I missed something that should affect my
ratings.
3 = Pretty sure, but there's a chance I missed something. Although I have a
good feel for this area in general, I did not carefully check the paper's
details, e.g., the math, experimental design, or novelty.
2 = Willing to defend my evaluation, but it is fairly likely that I missed
some details, didn't understand some central points, or can't be sure about
the novelty of the work.
1 = Not my area, or paper was hard for me to understand. My evaluation is
just an educated guess.

Presentation Format
-------------------

Papers at EMNLP can be presented either as poster or as oral presentation,
depending on what is most likely to be beneficial to convey its ideas to
its audience. If this paper were selected for presentation, which form of
presentation would you find more appropriate?

Note that the decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and
which as poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than on
the quality of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings
between papers presented orally and those presented as poster
presentations.


FORMATTING GUIDELINES
---------------------

Enter only plain ASCII text on these forms.  Use a text editor which 
can handle files in plain ASCII, without adding hidden formatting 
characters.  

Do not let the text automatically "wrap" around over an 80-column
viewing area.  Rather, make sure you insert a linefeed at the end of
each line.

Paragraphs should be separated by two linefeeds (like the text in 
these instructions).

Remember that your textual comments will also be presented in HTML
form.  START will attempt to preserve the "flow" of your original
ASCII content in HTML (e.g., to preserve itemized lists, enumeration,
etc.).  But the narrative sections will be filled, i.e., the content
will be resized to fit the browser window.

That said, you may want to include multi-line formulas, tables, or
matrices in your review - where the alignment and spacing of the data
needs to be preserved as entered, even when rendered in HTML.  To
accomplish this, you can include "<pre>" contexts in your textual
comments, in which case the enclosed data will be displayed as it was
entered.  For example:

   <pre>
   7   5  11
   0   0   1
   1   0   1                   
   </pre>

If you do use this feature, do not forget the closing "</pre>" tag, 
at the end of the pre-formatted text. And in general, only use 
<pre>-style formatting when it's absolutely necessary to do so.
