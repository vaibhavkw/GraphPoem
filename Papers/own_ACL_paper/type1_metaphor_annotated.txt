the old chronological towers are ash , are prisms of disfigurement , symbolic of a world cancelled by consumptive inmelodias . as for alchemical transition , we face the raising of new sea walls , of banished and re-engendered electorates , trying to cope with new intensities of weather , as the anomalous hypnotically increases with the power of inverse subjective . the body is now weighed on a broken axial cart , its blood conjoined as it rises within a nuclear darkness of ravens . so as piscean chronology now shatters , dawn becomes an unclaimed resurrection , a tumultuous eikon of skin no longer formed around its old dendritic artifacts . the calendar of draconian enfeeblement with its integers of the past 20 centuries , erased , its linear babels darkened by the extreme necessity for a new perpendicular burst , transmuting in demeanour , with history consumed in a roll of flaming aural dice , with its wizardry of tools subsumed in arcane vibration , turned into a power of splendiferous scorpions . the psychic wounds of the past eclipsed in this new millenium by the power of smelted dragon 's blood . and so , i speak of a new being of symbols , of lucid catacombs and spirals , its language being spun in fabulous iguana iridium . now , with the decayed constitutional stages exploded by telepathy , by invulnerable oneiric intuitives , the mental axis transmutes , like a reddened swan , with a new cosmic skeletal reprieve , afloat amongst the forces of the primeval lightning field , taking on the dharma of the great sustained emotion of eternity . @4@y

i love sweets , -- heaven would be dying on a bed of vanilla ice cream ... but my true self is thin , all profile and effortless gestures , the sort of blond elegant girl whose body is the image of her soul . -- my doctors tell me i must give up this ideal ; but i will not ... cannot . only to my husband i 'm not simply a " case . " but he is a fool . he married meat , and thought it was a wife . . . . why am i a girl ? i ask my doctors , and they tell me they do n't know , that it is just "given . " but it has such implications -- ; and sometimes , i even feel like a girl . . . . now , at the beginning of ellen 's thirty-second year , her physical condition has deteriorated still further . her use of laxatives increases beyond measure . every evening she takes sixty to seventy tablets of a laxative , with the result that she suffers tortured vomiting at night and violent diarrhea by day , often accompanied by a weakness of the heart . she has thinned down to a skeleton , and weighs only 92 pounds . . . . about five years ago , i was in a restaurant , eating alone with a book . i was not married , and often did that ... -- i 'd turn down dinner invitations , so i could eat alone ; i 'd allow myself two pieces of bread , with butter , at the beginning , and three scoops of vanilla ice cream , at the end , -- sitting there alone with a book , both in the book and out of it , waited on , idly watching people , -- when an attractive young man and woman , both elegantly dressed , sat next to me . she was beautiful -- ; with sharp , clear features , a good bone structure -- ; if she took her make-up off in front of you , rubbing cold cream again and again across her skin , she still would be beautiful -- more beautiful . and he , -- i could n't remember when i had seen a man so attractive . i did n't know why . he was almost a male version of her , -- i had the sudden , mad notion that i wanted to be his lover ... -- were they married ? were they lovers ? they did n't wear wedding rings . their behavior was circumspect . they discussed politics . they did n't touch ... -- how could i discover ? then , when the first course arrived , i noticed the way each held his fork out for the other to taste what he had ordered ... they did this again and again , with pleased looks , indulgent smiles , for each course , more than once for each dish -- ; much too much for just friends ... -- their behavior somehow sickened me ; the way each gladly put the food the other had offered into his mouth -- ; i knew what they were . i knew they slept together . an immense depression came over me ... -- i knew i could never with such ease allow another to put food into my mouth : happily myself put food into another 's mouth -- ; i knew that to become a wife i would have to give up my ideal . . . . even as a child , i saw that the "natural " process of aging is for one 's middle to thicken -- one 's skin to blotch ; as happened to my mother . and her mother . i loathed "nature . " at twelve , pancakes became the most terrible thought there is ... i shall defeat "nature . " in the hospital , when they weigh me , i wear weights secretly sewn into my belt . . . . january 16 . the patient is allowed to eat in her room , but comes readily with her husband to afternoon coffee . previously she had stoutly resisted this on the ground that she did not really eat but devoured like a wild animal . this she demonstrated with utmost realism .... her physical examination showed nothing striking . salivary glands are markedly enlarged on both sides . january 21 . has been reading faust again . in her diary , writes that art is the "mutual permeation " of the "world of the body " and the "world of the spirit " says that her own poems are "hospital poems ... weak -- without skill or perseverance ; only managing to beat their wings softly . " february 8. agitation , quickly subsided again . has attached herself to an elegant , very thin female patient . homo-erotic component strikingly evident . february 15 . vexation , and torment . says that her mind forces her always to think of eating . feels herself degraded by this . has entirely , for the first time in years , stopped writing poetry . . . . callas is my favorite singer , but i 've only seen her once -- ; i 've never forgotten that night ... -- it was in tosca , she had long before lost weight , her voice had been , for years , deteriorating , half itself ... when her career began , of course , she was fat , enormous -- ; in the early photographs , sometimes i almost do n't recognize her ... the voice too then was enormous -- healthy ; robust ; subtle ; but capable of crude effects , even vulgar , almost out of high spirits , too much health ... but soon she felt that she must lose weight , -- that all she was trying to express was obliterated by her body , buried in flesh -- ; abruptly , within four months , she lost at least sixty pounds ... -- the gossip in milan was that callas had swallowed a tapeworm . but of course she had n't . the tapeworm was her soul ... -- how her soul , uncompromising , insatiable , must have loved eating the flesh from her bones , revealing this extraordinarily mercurial ; fragile ; masterly creature ... -- but irresistibly , nothing stopped there ; the huge voice also began to change : at first , it simply diminished in volume , in size , then the top notes became shrill , unreliable -- at last , usually not there at all ... -- no one knows why . perhaps her mind , ravenous , still insatiable , sensed that to struggle with the shreds of a voice must make her artistry subtler , more refined , more capable of expressing humiliation , rage , betrayal ... -- perhaps the opposite . perhaps her spirit loathed the unending struggle to embody itself , to manifest itself , on a stage whose mechanics , and suffocating customs , seemed expressly designed to annihilate spirit ... -- i know that in tosca , in the second act , when , humiliated , hounded by scarpia , she sang vissi d'arte -- "i lived for art " -- and in torment , bewilderment , at the end she asks , with a voice reaching harrowingly for the notes , " art has repaid me like this ? " i felt i was watching autobiography -- an art ; skill ; virtuosity miles distant from the usual soprano 's athleticism , -- the usual musician 's dream of virtuosity without content ... -- i wonder what she feels , now , listening to her recordings . for they have already , within a few years , begun to date ... whatever they express they express through the style of a decade and a half -- ; a style she helped create ... -- she must know that now she probably would not do a trill in exactly that way , -- that the whole sound , atmosphere , dramaturgy of her recordings have just slightly become those of the past ... -- is it bitter ? does her soul tell her that she was an idiot ever to think anything material wholly could satisfy ? ... -- perhaps it says : the only way to escape the history of styles is not to have a body . . . . when i open my eyes in the morning , my great mystery stands before me ... -- i know that i am intelligent ; therefore the inability not to fear food day-and-night ; this unending hunger ten minutes after i have eaten ... a childish dread of eating ; hunger which can have no cause , -- half my mind says that all this is demeaning ... bread for days on end drives all real thought from my brain ... -- then i think , no . the ideal of being thin conceals the ideal not to have a body -- ; which is not trivial ... this wish seems now as much a "given " of my existence as the intolerable fact that i am dark-complexioned ; big-boned ; and once weighed one hundred and sixty-five pounds ... -- but then i think , no . that 's too simple , -- without a body , who can know himself at all ? only by acting ; choosing ; rejecting ; have i made myself -- discovered who and what ellen can be ... -- but then again i think , no . this i is anterior to name ; gender ; action ; fashion ; matter itself , -- ... trying to stop my hunger with food is like trying to appease thirst with ink . . . . march 30 . result of the consultation : both gentlemen agree completely with my prognosis and doubt any therapeutic usefulness of commitment even more emphatically than i . all three of us are agreed that it is not a case of obsessional neurosis and not one of manic-depressive psychosis , and that no definitely reliable therapy is possible . we therefore resolved to give in to the patient 's demand for discharge . . . . the train-ride yesterday was far worse than i expected ... in our compartment were ordinary people : a student ; a woman ; her child ; -- they had ordinary bodies , pleasant faces ; but i thought i was surrounded by creatures with the pathetic , desperate desire to be not what they were : -- the student was short , and carried his body as if forcing it to be taller -- ; the woman showed her gums when she smiled , and often held her hand up to hide them -- ; the child seemed to cry simply because it was small ; a dwarf , and helpless ... -- i was hungry . i had insisted that my husband not bring food ... after about thirty minutes , the woman peeled an orange to quiet the child . she put a section into its mouth -- ; immediately it spit it out . the piece fell to the floor . -- she pushed it with her foot through the dirt toward me several inches . my husband saw me staring down at the piece ... -- i did n't move ; how i wanted to reach out , and as if invisible shove it in my mouth -- ; my body became rigid . as i stared at him , i could see him staring at me , -- then he looked at the student -- ; at the woman -- ; then back to me ... i did n't move . -- at last , he bent down , and casually threw it out the window . he looked away . -- i got up to leave the compartment , then saw his face , -- his eyes were red ; and i saw -- i 'm sure i saw -- disappointment . . . . on the third day of being home she is as if transformed . at breakfast she eats butter and sugar , at noon she eats so much that -- for the first time in thirteen years ! -- she is satisfied by her food and gets really full . at afternoon coffee she eats chocolate creams and easter eggs . she takes a walk with her husband , reads poems , listens to recordings , is in a positively festive mood , and all heaviness seems to have fallen away from her . she writes letters , the last one a letter to the fellow patient here to whom she had become so attached . in the evening she takes a lethal dose of poison , and on the following morning she is dead . " she looked as she had never looked in life -- calm and happy and peaceful . " . . . dearest . -- i remember how at eighteen , on hikes with friends , when they rested , sitting down to joke or talk , i circled around them , afraid to hike ahead alone , yet afraid to rest when i was not yet truly thin . you and , yes , my husband , -- you and he have by degrees drawn me within the circle ; forced me to sit down at last on the ground . i am grateful . but something in me refuses it . -- how eager i have been to compromise , to kill this refuser , -- but each compromise , each attempt to poison an ideal which often seemed to me sterile and unreal , heightens my hunger . i am crippled . i disappoint you . will you greet with anger , or happiness , the news which might well reach you before this letter ? your ellen . @38@s

what can a yellow glove mean in a world of motorcars and governments ? i was small , like everyone . life was a string of precautions : do n't kiss the squirrel before you bury him , do n't suck candy , pop balloons , drop watermelons , watch tv. when the new gloves appeared one christmas , tucked in soft tissue , i heard it trailing me : do n't lose the yellow gloves . i was small , there was too much to remember . one day , waving at a stream -- the ice had cracked , winter chipping down , soon we would sail boats and roll into ditches -- i let a glove go . into the stream , sucked under the street . since when did streets have mouths ? i walked home on a desperate road . gloves cost money . we did n't have much . i would tell no one . i would wear the yellow glove that was left and keep the other hand in a pocket . i knew my mother 's eyes had tears they had not cried yet , i did n't want to be the one to make them flow . it was the prayer i spoke secretly , folding socks , lining up donkeys in windowsills . to be good , a promise made to the roaches who scouted my closet at night . if you do n't get in my bed , i will be good . and they listened . i had a lot to fulfill . the months rolled down like towels out of a machine . i sang and drew and fattened the cat . do n't scream , do n't lie , do n't cheat , do n't fight -- you could hear it anywhere . a pebble could show you how to be smooth , tell the truth . a field could show how to sleep without walls . a stream could remember how to drift and change -- next june i was stirring the stream like a soup , telling my brother dinner would be ready if he 'd only hurry up with the bread , when i saw it . the yellow glove draped on a twig . a muddy survivor . a quiet flag . where had it been in the three gone months ? i could wash it , fold it in my winter drawer with its sister , no one in that world would ever know . there were miracles on harvey street . children walked home in yellow light . trees were reborn and gloves traveled far , but returned . a thousand miles later , what can a yellow glove mean in a world of bankbooks and stereos ? part of the difference between floating and going down . @22@s

" i lis - ten to it differently now . i wait for the echo they tell me is there , preceding each note , and it 's as if i were experiencing the music a pri- ori . i listen to the chords or whole riffs bouncing off the walls versus sound in real time . doing so , i miss the actual song , which is also delayed because this is , after all , a recording . once , the concept of real time was redundant . before the first gramophone . before we learned to manipulate the speed of things to come . and long before that , the idea of a spirit that takes over for the temporary body was already popular . perhaps our first attempt to deny the unavoidable . one new religion offers immortality . for a price . unlike traditional religions in which death is a prerequisite , this one teaches the body to bypass the soul , that middle man who always gets in the way , and the here-and-now becomes a here-and-always . it 's all up here , one of its members says to me , pointing his index finger at his temple , as if mimicking a gun . i may actually want to die before i get old , i think , the radio as loud as it 'll go , one chord after another bouncing off the walls so many years ago at leeds , the road much longer than i 'd expected , the signal grow- ing weaker and one station giving way to another . from feedback to static to a preacher who invites me or commands me or dares me to lay my hands on the radio . both hands , he says . i raise my legs , raise my whole body ( although it 's not levitation or anything nearly as glam - orous ) to steady the steering wheel . 4 . in the book of ironies they forgot to write that a superstitious woman will end up marrying an atheist . curiously , in all the cases i know , it 's the man who does n't believe . the woman is always open at the very least to the possibility of that " something out there . " at times her superstitions are proof of god 's constant tinkering with the cogs and wheels of the soul . there are atheists with proof of a finite world , atheists in need of a finite world , reformed atheists whose image of god has become so pure over the years that it has gone from inevitable to unnecessary to simply impossible . one believer argues that only the next life makes this one tolerable and lends it purpose , that only the idea of being part of something cir- cular can keep us from going mad , because true madness is linear and the points at either end are clearly defined . this is an uncom - fortable thought for her . i wonder if her belief is , more than any- thing , a way to keep at bay this linear derangement . the atheist lying beside her is beginning to sink into sleep when she speaks : she has carefully chosen this moment , thinking he 's vulnerable enough to say what she wants to hear . he sits on the edge of the bed and won- ders for a moment what it would be like to take that leap forward ; or backward , which is something she does n't mention : believers of her kind tend to discount any previous incarnations , as if eternity began here . being here , he says to himself as he has said to her so many times , is the point . then he tries to think his way back to sleep : wedding band , crown , zero , smoke ring , lasso , hula hoop . @1022@s

1 . when handling the past in the present tense , chronology is of the utmost importance . suppose i say i 'm eight years old and all the rooms of my father 's house are larger than life . then i say two days after my first divorce , the only landscape i know is simplified , bone-smooth . the past remains practically undisturbed . but suppose i reverse the order in which the episodes are recreated , and time goes on a rampage , and i find myself coming and going . journeys on land have a spherical tendency because this is always at some level the nature of the ter- rain . the anthill crumbles in the rain and the ants returning with more provisions walk past the leveled mound ; having noticed noth - ing , they keep looking for home . though each mouth carries its crumb of substance , tradition and evolution will see to it that it is n't eaten until the journey has been completed . it 's not unusual for the ants to walk repeatedly over the ruins . a squirrel chases itself so fast around the trunk of a palm tree that it appears to be standing still , like propeller blades in midflight .

dear miss , first of all i want to say that i have enjoyed the imaginary possibility , built of course on the fact that such possibility does exist in nature : i have seen the birds and other forms of nonhumanity occur in such postures that must be with men and women ....i have imagined myself in such postures with you , where flight was discouraged only by the inherent possibility of the firm horizontal ... as men give vast lands to little papers with line and color , i have imagined more on the surface of your body , giving all the universe in this model .... yet , i must be curious about your breasts ...curious ...hungry is the word , to see , to touch , to taste ....i am curious as to how your hands undress your body . i am interested in your mind : will you undress in front of me ? will you permit me the unparalleled pleasure of taking your clothes off ? i feel that if i should have my penis in your vagina i should have your love ; for you do not receive the wretched hardness of my desire into the sweet body of yourself without that you have not come to love me for reasons , if love has reasons , i cannot tell .... your admirer @120@s
