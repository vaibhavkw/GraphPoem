Line : The old chronological towers are ash , are prisms of disfigurement , symbolic of a world cancelled by consumptive inmelodias . As for alchemical transition , we face the raising of new sea walls , of banished and re - engendered electorates , trying to cope with new intensities of weather , as the anomalous hypnotically increases with the power of inverse subjective .  The body is now weighed on a broken axial cart , its blood conjoined as it rises within a nuclear darkness of ravens . So as Piscean chronology now shatters , dawn becomes an unclaimed resurrection , a tumultuous eikon of skin no longer formed around its old dendritic artifacts . The calendar of draconian enfeeblement with its integers of the past 20 centuries , erased , its linear Babels darkened by the extreme necessity for a new perpendicular burst , transmuting in demeanour , with history consumed in a roll of flaming aural dice , with its wizardry of tools subsumed in arcane vibration , turned into a power of splendiferous scorpions . The psychic wounds of the past eclipsed in this new millenium by the power of smelted dragon 's blood .  And so , I speak of a new being of symbols , of lucid catacombs and spirals , its language being spun in fabulous iguana iridium . Now , with the decayed constitutional stages exploded by telepathy , by invulnerable oneiric intuitives , the mental axis transmutes , like a reddened swan , with a new cosmic skeletal reprieve , afloat amongst the forces of the primeval lightning field , taking on the dharma of the great sustained emotion of eternity .

Line : What can a yellow glove mean in a world of motorcars and governments ?  I was small , like everyone . Life was a string of precautions : Do n't kiss the squirrel before you bury him , do n't suck candy , pop balloons , drop watermelons , watch TV. When the new gloves appeared one Christmas , tucked in soft tissue , I heard it trailing me : Do n't lose the yellow gloves .  I was small , there was too much to remember . One day , waving at a stream -- the ice had cracked , winter chipping down , soon we would sail boats and roll into ditches -- I let a glove go . Into the stream , sucked under the street . Since when did streets have mouths ? I walked home on a desperate road . Gloves cost money . We did n't have much . I would tell no one . I would wear the yellow glove that was left and keep the other hand in a pocket . I knew my mother 's eyes had tears they had not cried yet , I did n't want to be the one to make them flow . It was the prayer I spoke secretly , folding socks , lining up donkeys in windowsills . To be good , a promise made to the roaches who scouted my closet at night . If you do n't get in my bed , I will be good . And they listened . I had a lot to fulfill .  The months rolled down like towels out of a machine . I sang and drew and fattened the cat . Do n't scream , do n't lie , do n't cheat , do n't fight -- you could hear it anywhere . A pebble could show you how to be smooth , tell the truth . A field could show how to sleep without walls . A stream could remember how to drift and change -- next June I was stirring the stream like a soup , telling my brother dinner would be ready if he 'd only hurry up with the bread , when I saw it . The yellow glove draped on a twig . A muddy survivor . A quiet flag .  Where had it been in the three gone months ? I could wash it , fold it in my winter drawer with its sister , no one in that world would ever know . There were miracles on Harvey Street . Children walked home in yellow light . Trees were reborn and gloves traveled far , but returned . A thousand miles later , what can a yellow glove mean in a world of bankbooks and stereos ?  Part of the difference between floating and going down .

Line : Mardohai Simhon claimed the silk scarf he wore around his neck was a mirror .  " Look , " he said , " my head is separated from my body by a scarf . Who dares give me the life if I say I walk with a knotted mirror under my chin ?  " The scarf reflects a face , and you think it is of flesh .  " Night is the mirror . Day the scarf . Moon and sun reflected features . But my true face , brothers , where did I lose it ? "  At his death , a large scar was discovered on his neck .  The meaning of this anecdote was discussed by the rabbis .  Reb Alphandery , in his authority as the oldest , spoke first .  " A double mirror , " he said , " separates us from the Lord so that God sees Himself when trying to see us , and we , when trying to see Him , see only our own face . "  " Is appearance no more than the reflections thrown back and forth by a set of mirrors ? " asked Reb Ephraim . " You are no doubt alluding to the soul , Reb Alphandery , in which we see ourselves mirrored . But the body is the place of the soul , just as the mountain is the bed of the brook . The body has broken the mirror . "  " The brook , " continued Reb Alphandery , " sleeps on the summit . The brook 's dream is of water , as is the brook . It flows for us . Our dreams extend us .  " Do you not remember this phrase of Reb Alsem 's : ' We live out the dream of creation , which is God 's dream . In the evening our own dreams snuggle down into it like sparrows in their nests . '  " And did not Reb Hames write : ' Birds of night , my dreams explore the immense dream of the sleeping universe . ' "  " Are dreams the limpid discourse between the facets of a crystal block ? " continued Reb Ephraim . " The world is of glass . You know it by its brilliance , night or day . "  " The earth turns in a mirror . The earth turns in a scarf , " replied Reb Alphandery .  " The scarf of a dandy with a nasty scar , " said Reb Ephraim .  ( " Words are inside breath , as the earth is inside time . "  - Reb Mares )  And Yukel said :  " The bundle of the Wandering Jew contains the earth and more than one star . "  " Whatever contains is itself contained , " said Reb Mawas .  The story I told you , as well as the commentaries it inspired , will be recorded in the book of the eye . The ladder urges us beyond ourselves . Hence its importance . But in a void , where do we place it ?  ( " God is sculpted . "  - Reb Moyal )

Line : 1 .  When handling the past in the present tense , chronology is of the  utmost importance . Suppose I say I 'm eight years old and all the rooms  of my father 's house are larger than life . Then I say Two days after my  first divorce , the only landscape I know is simplified , bone - smooth . The  past remains practically undisturbed . But suppose I reverse the order  in which the episodes are recreated , and time goes on a rampage , and I find myself coming and going . Journeys on land have a spherical tendency because this is always at some level the nature of the ter- rain . The anthill crumbles in the rain and the ants returning with more provisions walk past the leveled mound ; having noticed noth- ing , they keep looking for home . Though each mouth carries its crumb of substance , tradition and evolution will see to it that it is n't eaten until the journey has been completed . It 's not unusual for the ants to walk repeatedly over the ruins . A squirrel chases itself so fast around the trunk of a palm tree that it appears to be standing still , like propeller blades in midflight . ( I used to know the cause of this illusion . ) I say Someone 's at the door , somebody please get the door although I have n't lived there in years . Somebody please get the door . I want nothing more than my share of the past .  2 .  True . There are degrees of isolation . Sixteen days after a shopping center collapses like a punctured lung in Seoul , South Korea , a nine- teen - year - old girl is found alive in an elevator shaft . Her only nour- ishment throughout the ordeal is an apple that a monk gives her in a dream . The doctors are skeptical and attribute her survival , instead , to " her false perception of time . " The brain -- with its network of rivers and tributaries , the flow rigorously controlled -- is taxed by a sudden drought . Or an apple passes from one hand to another . In both versions , extraordinary measures achieve a modicum of nor- malcy , shaken again when a boy -- age thirteen , his circadian rhythms still fighting the syncopation of jet lag -- walks out the window on the thirtieth floor of a Swedish building . They 're calling it " a sleep- walking accident , " as if sleep were a cognitive state . If that were the case , our sheep and our prayers would keep us up all night , count- ing and repenting , and there would be degrees of salvation . I can tell you that none of this is true , but much of it is , and you will not for- give me when you discover that I 've led you to believe otherwise . The truth , in one form or another , has ways of finding you . Blame it on your false perception of the facts . Time the sniper has lapses in which its eyes tire and its focus falters and it aims at itself . So the window opens ; the girl shakes the rubble from her dress ; a monk , gathering apples in his robe , almost catches the falling boy .  3 .  They say that when the Who performed at Leeds University on Valentine 's Day 1970 , Pete Townshend played against his own echo during some of those riveting excursions he launched into through- out the band 's quarter - hour - long offering of " My Generation . " I lis- ten to it differently now . I wait for the echo they tell me is there , preceding each note , and it 's as if I were experiencing the music a pri- ori . I listen to the chords or whole riffs bouncing off the walls versus sound in real time . Doing so , I miss the actual song , which is also delayed because this is , after all , a recording . Once , the concept of real time was redundant . Before the first gramophone . Before we learned to manipulate the speed of things to come . And long before that , the idea of a spirit that takes over for the temporary body was already popular . Perhaps our first attempt to deny the unavoidable . One new religion offers immortality . For a price . Unlike traditional religions in which death is a prerequisite , this one teaches the body to bypass the soul , that middle man who always gets in the way , and the here - and - now becomes a here - and - always . It 's all up here , one of its members says to me , pointing his index finger at his temple , as if mimicking a gun . I may actually want to die before I get old , I think , the radio as loud as it 'll go , one chord after another bouncing off the walls so many years ago at Leeds , the road much longer than I 'd expected , the signal grow- ing weaker and one station giving way to another . From feedback to static to a preacher who invites me or commands me or dares me to lay my hands on the radio . Both hands , he says . I raise my legs , raise my whole body ( although it 's not levitation or anything nearly as glam- orous ) to steady the steering wheel .  4 .  In The Book of Ironies they forgot to write that a superstitious woman will end up marrying an atheist . Curiously , in all the cases I know , it 's the man who does n't believe . The woman is always open at the very least to the possibility of that " something out there . " At times her superstitions are proof of God 's constant tinkering with the cogs and wheels of the soul . There are atheists with proof of a finite world , atheists in need of a finite world , reformed atheists whose image of God has become so pure over the years that it has gone from inevitable to unnecessary to simply impossible . One believer argues that only the next life makes this one tolerable and lends it purpose , that only the idea of being part of something cir- cular can keep us from going mad , because true madness is linear and the points at either end are clearly defined . This is an uncom- fortable thought for her . I wonder if her belief is , more than any- thing , a way to keep at bay this linear derangement . The atheist lying beside her is beginning to sink into sleep when she speaks : she has carefully chosen this moment , thinking he 's vulnerable enough to say what she wants to hear . He sits on the edge of the bed and won- ders for a moment what it would be like to take that leap forward ; or backward , which is something she does n't mention : believers of her kind tend to discount any previous incarnations , as if eternity began here . Being here , he says to himself as he has said to her so many times , is the point . Then he tries to think his way back to sleep : wedding band , crown , zero , smoke ring , lasso , hula hoop .

Line : gustave morin 's primary form is the collage poem . His " toon tune " is a remarkable piece of craftsmanship . Its sixty - three individual fragments of text are cut into the shapes of jigsaw puzzle pieces and are fit perfectly together in a rectangular grid . The " words " of the poem consist almost entirely of the extravagant visualizations of onomatopoeia from comic books , producing a visual symphony of crashes and cries.--Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry > >

Line : I. PULSE  Light over the Hudson recovers a Caribbean I have  never seen . We list islands : Molokai , Oahu , Kauai ; St. Lucia ,  Haiti .... The surf folds tunnels of light while a hand folds over a wrist ( tell - tale pulse ) , counting . The long tunnel is a wrist of blown spume .  It is like a dance , I think , this silence full of questions . Pulse - beat ; pulse - beat .  Pulse .  Pulse .  I push my hair back into the memories of palm trees , brushing my hands and my  hair on the islands .  2 . NIGHT MUSIC Garlic and sapphires in the mud ...  T.S. Eliot  The window opens onto a fire escape . The Sausage Manufacturers ' Chamber Group , scattered  among potted geraniums and dying petunias , plays Hindemith 's Kleine Kammermusik . The oboist , his briefcase full of knockwurst and reeds , is suffering  from hiccups . The cheerful notes -- hiccups on oboe -- float in through  the window . Ralph turns in bed , a flailing arm upsetting the urinal . Perhaps he is awake .  A pale German shepherd  leaps through the window , over the bars of the hospital bed , and begins to lick  Ralph 's feet . Why are Ralph 's feet out of the covers ? The dog looks  up , and says " Ralph , " and walks up Ralph 's stomach to stare in his eyes . " Where is your bone ? " Ralph says ; but the dog curls up  under Ralph 's left arm and falls asleep . " Why not ? " Ralph thinks . The musicians have departed , only a faint odor of garlic lingering on the windowsill . " I could call you Fritz , " Ralph says to the sleeping dog , " or Cokie or maybe even Pepe . But I 'll call you Ralph . " This time the music comes through the window  without hiccups and without garlic .  3 . THE INVENTIONS OF SLEEP  A telephone call begins on the television set : You are in a phone booth , headlights in the distance , behind you couples strolling in a park . We almost know  each other 's names , and I think about children moving out of darkness into  patches of light then back into darkness . Their voices are a murmur under your soft voice .  " I 'm tired now , " you say ; " I have n't been called before . "  In Manitoba winter , in loose snow thrown up by the  Canadian Pacific , elk burrow down , their great antlers caught in the dining car lights . Their  heads turn to each other in snow , muzzles , flanks touching under the snow line .  If I am asleep , your voice is folded under my arm , and I whisper , " sleep well , " watching the antlers turn  to each other in loose snow , the summer voices blurred by city traffic .  4 . THE DARK , THE DREAM  At 11:15 , I will follow the last corridor into darkness . At 10:30 , when I had spoken to the darkness for the  first time , I had asked the darkness the names of all the corridors , calling your name into every closed  door . But tonight all of the doors are windows .  Hide and seek :  Helen  George  Barbara  Tom  Sheryl  of patches of fog on an Irish lake ,  Roger watching swans vanish .  Muffie dancing  Jim climbing the switchback  trail into light .  Margaret and Mike dealing the cards , Janet  asleep .  Lights go on and off back of the windows : I call your  name at the head of each corridor .  ... not windows . Vyvian hands me the negatives : ten seconds : Theone on the far side of the car :  four a.m. , truth  balanced on a steering wheel ; ten seconds : my mother 's body falling toward darkness , the dead child falling , Bob Pawlowsky falling :  I  have no goodbye .  . . .  11:15 : hide and seek , and the long corridor darkening  against night 's invention echo lengthening . --my way now , calling .  5 . SCARS  That little scar I 'll never see on the left underside of my  heart or the almost - closed arteries opening and closing like  baby mouths or the good artery , a tiny flow talking about  tomorrow ....  Strange in the garden , watching two boys wrestle in  long grass , their wheelchair friend in zebra - striped pajamas watching  the wrestling , all three in the hungry shade of a magnolia . Binoculars : The boy in striped pajamas ' dense shouts : shouting ,  shouting : " Quit it , you cocksuckers ! They wo n't even let you  walk on the grass . Quit ! " They are hidden by the magnolia . I can not hear them . The long magnolia branches wrestle like boys ' white  arms and legs .  That scar in the groin : hernia . Punched hole in the  groin : heart catheter . The new scar throat to belly .  Now they have helped the zebra boy back into the  wheelchair and , pushing him up the hospital ramp , take turns  bumping shoulders . " Quit it you pricks ! Do you want me thrown out of the  place ? "  I listen to my casual heart beating veins into arteries ;  then I approach the zebra and his friends .  In Africa , wildebeest , impala , warthog gather at the  waterhold , nudging shoulders . The gaunt flat - topped trees cast lion shadows , vultures circling . Where are the sabre tooth tiger , the  mastodon ?  I think of America cemented coast to coast , white  jet - trail scars for sky , a loveliness of footprints jumbled on spring grass .  6 . POST - OPERATIVE ( 1 )  Fever again : 101  slow footsteps on the beach . The footsteps are a conversation in the  waves . " Come . I 'm here . "  I am walking toward the  long - haired woman wrestling already her bright shoulders ' turning . On the shore , gaunt lovers wrestle bone against bone , rib cages interlocked , bone grinding : slow footsteps  music on dry sand  7 . POST OPERATIVE ( 2 )  Joy crusted with pain :  fresh lava  breaking through  a shifting black map  in the crater pit :  Mauna Ulu : New Mountain .  Seabird , seabird , fly the old lava . In long light , at the foot of the pali , press in on the 40-foot spine , legs wrapping heads ; arms , torso , genitals cradled in legs , a 40-foot snake , chain of love , birth chain , twisting in the long ocean light , an arm under the dark cloud brushing generations of lovers . Seabird , seabird , fly in on a long stroke of cold light .  8 . POST - OPERATIVE ( 3 ) : THE ELEVATOR  Elevator : a hand on my shoulder , a hand on the  wheelchair , hands brushing my hair ... or the blown hair of a woman shouldered in  sea - foam ... elk burrowing in loose snow ... or a mouth opening , closing  mouths meeting .  In one step , I am free , my feet firm . This is Manhattan , the cement island , below me the  Hudson roped in pale rain . Three boys break into a run , dodging taxis . Their jeans are tight wet skins , their wet faces masks . " Run fast ! " The towers of the hospital shape sky .  Haiti , Kauai , Manhattan -- white shoulders of the sea  breaking down every island .  A little box on a chain goes up and down :  up  down .  Once , in a dream , the elevator reached top floor , then shifted sideways , finding another shaft ; at basement , it returned to floor 1 , returned to basement , floor 1 , basement , then floor 10 , floor 11--sideways on floor 11 , doors opening into mouths .  A mouth in my heart says a name , calling . Then  another , another .  I brush dry sand from my arms that are streaming rain , turning toward Broadway .

Line : Several of my cousins lean up against the house , taking long drags from the pack of Marlboros we share . We have always been this way -- addicted and generous . A pow wow tape plays from inside the open garage where two old uncles are thinking to themselves in the safety of its shadows . Our aunties are in the kitchen , preparing the boiled meat and chokecherry soup and laughing about old jokes they still hang onto because these things are a matter of survival . Outside , we ask about who was driving around with who last night , where so - and - so got beat up , whose girlfriend left him for someone else . ( But she 'll go back to him , we all think to ourselves . ) Aunties carry the full pots and pans to the picnic table , an uncle prays over our food in Assiniboine . We all want to forget that we do n't understand this language , we spend lots of time trying to forget in different ways . No one notices that the wild turnips are still simmering in a pot on the stove .

Hundreds of agitated birds swooping over the bridge . Our blessed moments . Shapes of soft parts , a quantifiable relation to objects , we turn now to your vitreous humor . Shut the lights off , turn the meat down , cover your head . I started doing my duty . Graphs of a dancer 's movements . Ten sections of a neural issue . As from air to the cornea . Who in the person is larval or asexual . Who in the person will sit in . Hachure . A parallel walk . From one density to a different density . I was you , once . Come , come , under your skin . In the body receiving itself or its analogies . The my . The bow down before you . White pine to white pine . White pine to redwing to lantern fish .  II  She was full .  She was full with it .

Believe it or not we set off several long - haired bodies . Believe it or not that was the whole of our aestivation . Believe it or not stop talking about me as if I were not in the room . Pop open a new one . The developing figure was a monk bent over . Come allow us to see the sower sow . She contested the waters . Get thee behind . Something in her eye kept giving you the needle . Something in her eye kept falling out of line . Believe it or not three persons in one shadow . Believe it or not could you spare a mind . It clawed each thing as if a temporal sequence . It clawed each thing as if a temporal w . Believe it or not six or eight ways of counting on your reticence . Believe it or not these long thin rods and the wider cones .

Line : The spine is a slide of human marvels ; it is a hierarchy of white florets ; it is a cult of secret brothers ; it is a deliberate list ; so look how the spineless relax in their unblushing banality . I lose my patience in Greensboro where no discoveries are ever made and the only inner lavishment is the bar , occasionally . The spineless aspire to incessant interludes that never arrive anywhere and that ca n't remember wherefrom they came . Mary is slightly spineless , for instance : her dress is cream her skin is cream her creamy mind is fine and her life will end finely -- how sad is that to think of , the finery of a cream life ? It is the saddest of all truths that can be read on a person 's face in a decorous garden that person has planted themselves and of which they are explaining to you the intricacies and expense : " notice how in the light " ; " three pallets shipped last week " ; " have complementary attitudes when it comes to soil - type and moisture . " She is n't wicked ; but , also , she destroys the art of her life .

Line : 1 Reverse the book in duration . What does that mean ? I am writing to you . These notes now when it 's too late .  2 If the cyborg you read about in bookstores is an immigrant from Mexico crossing into the U.S. beneath a floodlit court , then mine is a Punjabi - British hitchhiker on a JI visa . This is tunneling as seen from a satellite -- sort of concave warp in the dirt of the line .  3 She lives in a house with others , including animals , creating individual spaces of companionship and ardor . What happens when this domestic life grows suspect ? When the grass reverts in its granular drag to the subject of architecture : the failure of a house to believe in its occupants ?  4 Mate with surfaces . Okay . Hitchhike . Okay . Make a cup of Darjeeling tea and start walking down a sidewalk in America . I saw this in a film starring George Clooney ; no , Natalie Wood . The last scene is her , the gamine self , kicking off her shoes as the house explodes behind her . Perpetrating , she does n't flinch . Sips tea . Keeps walking . I wanted to write that . Continuance . As it related to loss . The secret pleasure of refusing to live like a normal person in a dress a sex drive and fingers yet stabilized in the cafe of languages .  5 I want to have sex with what I want to become . This is a statement related to women arriving in a country it would be regressive to leave . Then , writing , I was filled with a longing for -- for what ? George - in - the - flesh ? George Clooney in Idaho , pretending to pick up hitchhikers as research for his next movie in which he plays a mild - mannered serial killer ? No . A different series of acts . Tricky . For example , I 'm embarrassed by this book . It makes my blood roar to think of you reading it . So intimate . A text . Then it is a document related to shame flooding the body to make it red . Who does n't want to heal a human body ? Who does n't want a perfect human body ? The body of my hitchhiker is , thus , inevitably female or Punjabi , fused to the production of secrets . There are no e - mails home from the e - mail cafe . Nothing . Phone calls , bullshitting . Sickening . I mean , what is this girl girl doing , there in a foreign heartland like a dog with a thumb ? My Laloo , about to do it . Do n't do it , little one . Red dress . Do n't get into the car .  6 But then , lit up , a red wife , kind of , not really , she sets out to see things as they are . Describes a virtual countryside . Jumps a box car . Drinks domestic beer . Okay . She does it and I write it down : a damaged eye with votive filaments . ( I am writing to you . ) " No point in writing home . " Then what ?

Line : Myth is prison , a palace , truth without fact .  Myth is birth and pleasure , teeth and death ,  sharp shiver of that which is broken .  Myth is patriarchal and worn ,  full of fratricide and rape .  Myth is a garden , makes good television ,  memoir ,  the scandal of animals  and people  coupling beneath the stars .  Myth is crow eating roadkill and dodging the occasional cars ,  a pile of guts and bones .  Myth is carrying the body back to the den .  -Close your eyes and count to ten . 1 .  " In language , there are always two . "  The Iliad stolen from Thoreau 's cabin , the only thing taken during those years . Remember , too , The Aenied ( we all have lived through times of war ) and that passage a friend said to know well , " Learn fortitude and toil from me , my son , Ache of true toil . Good fortune learn from others . "  2 .  Ultrasound images of my heart . That it moves and moves and then moves again , plump muscle shuddering , laboring to make up for one bad valve .  Spots in the ocean where nothing lives and yet there is movement , water moving .  I stand in the river fishing and watching an osprey slide through the air ten feet above the water .  I hear those wings . 3 .  Eleven years of loving ca n't just vanish . I have photographs . I have facts . " Hapy Birthday Dady " scribbled on a card .  How easy to sit at a desk  and not see the full moon  through the window .  Roy Sullivan , Virginia Park Ranger ,  struck by lightning seven times ,  kills himself after being dumped by a lover .  " Present fears are less than horrible imaginings . "  A friend asks , " Why are you hiding in myth ? "  4 .  I gather a lock of his hair , a scrap of T - shirt , a baby tooth , his tiny spoon , a diaper pin with a blue plastic stork , the quilted blanket , his first steps , hands clutching my fingers , the long night when his fever rose to 104 ? , his split lip at age six when he jumped with outspread arms , the first shoe , a locket with a toddler photo , first day of school , first finger painting , the green cardboard sculpture like something shaped by Breton , T - ball games , the flopping trout he squeezed too hard , his first broken bone , his fear when he felt my trembling hands trying to tell him something about the sun . 5 .  Trout with a slashed back where talons tore dorsal flesh and the flesh slipped from an osprey 's grip to a lucky landing in the creek 's waiting water , thrashing and calming , lingering beneath a deep cutbank , and weeks later , taking my elk hair caddis and leaping  completely out of the water .  On the far bank , a muskrat struggles and does a melodramatic gangster fall into the creek where it splashes and sinks . " Rattlesnake , " my friend says , and I nod and stare at where the ripple swirls into the current  and think about sinking bones .  6 .  The court acknowledges the petitioner 's long involvement with _________ 's life and sincerely hopes that the parties involved will have the generosity and wisdom to honor that relationship .  Do not blame the wind that scatters apple blossoms ruthlessly . Allow that flowers desire farewell blessings before their time has come .  7 .  Fishing in the desert creek a few days after the hearing , I find bones , steer skulls with round sockets for horns , and step near three rattlesnakes , almost grab a fourth when climbing a steep bank . The snakes were sluggish , though , late spring when the temperatures in the desert dipped into the thirties at night . Only one rattled , and the rain of the previous days made the fishing terrible , water brown and swift . I did n't get a bite and drove home , bought a bucket of fried chicken , and ate in front of the television his clothes still hanging in a closet .  8 .  There is no  end to the hours  when cedars and peaks scratch the sky 's belly . No garden , but sometimes , wildflowers . Sometimes , fish hold against the river 's current then dart with a silvery flash downstream . Sometimes , deer on the other shore stand still for a moment , then hunch toward their grazing .  9 .

For hours I 've been walking around , and I hate to be the one to tell you this , but no one is home in Zanesville , Ohio . My dusty toothbrush waits for me , of this I feel quite sure , my teenage image in the dust - dimmed mirror waits . Only now I 'm afraid I 'll be forced to disturb the slow fine snow of dust that 's been coming down , year after year , on my blanket and hair , and put on my dust - covered clothes , and walk without making a sound , trailing my eternal lunar footprints , down the windless hall , and down the stairs at last . It 's not going to happen overnight . But one of these days I 'll arrive ; I will go down to sit with the father . The elderly father , strictly speaking , of never really having been there . I will sit down and eat my bowl of dust like all the rest .

Line : For me , biography is a lantern , burning in the midst of parenthetical opaqueness . In a sense , it is a ruse , a phantasmic meandering , brighter or dimmer , according to the ecletic happenstance of terror . Me , I 've been sired in anomaly , in an imagery of brewing grenadine riddles , a parallel poesis spawned from curious seismographic molten . I say curious , because the original stalking arc has disappeared into the wilderness of an a priori blizzard , which gives birth to a level , like a portal of fire conjoined with the lightning field of mystery . I call it the poetic guardian dove , the hieratic alien wing . It is the non - local field , the non - particle acid , flowing into my cognitive iodine rays , into the vicious fires of my tarantella marshes . So I dance with vibration , with the solar arc spinning backward around the miraculous force of a double green horizon . Simultaneously , I escape the territorial , while remaining within the burning loops of my own momentary seizures , guarded by ferns , legs plowing land , the face and the mind guided by stars . So , I am a martyr of drills , of spates of specific lingual flooding , casting at times , a mist or a mirage , like a caravan of yaks , transporting tungsten and water . Conversely , to give a graph of dates , to single out a bevy of personal social lesions , would invert me , would turn me around a diurnal bundle of glass , staggered , with a less than fiery temperature , partially nulling my sensitivity to falling phonemic peppers , to the inclination towards victory which burns in the dawn above heaven . For me , this is the green locale , the pleroma of eternal solar essence , glinting , full of fabulous maelstrom diamonds , an empowered hegira of drift , of claustrophobic rainbow spectrums which empty themselves , and return to themselves , like having an image go out and return to itself , so that its power transmutes by the very energy of its looping ; and I think of myself , the poet sending signals into mystery , and having them return to me with oneiric wings and spirals , so much so , that I forget my prosaic locale with its stultifying anchors , with its familial dotage and image reports , with its dates inscribed in trapezoidal feces . I am only concerned with simultaneity and height , with rays of monomial kindling , guiding the neo - cortex through ravens , into the ecstasy of x - rays and blackness .

Line : Set up curbside , jewelry tray entanglement with things looking up , but nothing sells unless there is someone looking down , and who might that be ? For the moment it 's not raining and off - coast in pods the gray whales parade south . Photographs sprout with the season . The gray whale 's spout is heart shaped , enough said . Just listen for the icon 's intake of breath and see what you can see . Yes , but that was yesterday and which way are prices going to go ? There is a pack forming and they will need a leader . It 's then you kick the snot out of them , not before , and make it believable this one last time ; but do n't depend on it , auditors , even though it 's turned out like this so many times before . There may be an image whose mind has changed . Sorry , no rain checks in this scheme of things , the windows are broken and boards keep out the light , it 's the cheapest thing to do and then forget it , as has been done before , before , etc . Could you pick out of a lineup who is the culprit here ? The mirror is one - way and there 's no way to be sure which side you 're on , but so what ? Go on making faces anyway , but be sure , now and then , to check your hand before your face , if just to say Wheaties , the best is yet to be . Our inventions , gods and needles , for instance , are built to say this to us ever and forever . It 's obvious why we ca n't give them up , they 're ours , for ourself self 's sake ! We live in the afterlife of what , unalterable , has already taken place . The minute you start acting like Robinson Crusoe it 's plain to see you 've lost your hold on the world . There are many such , so many , washed up on our island shores ! They end up sleeping over grates and in doorways at night , far distant from tree ripe fruit and warm sand . The dumps of our artifacts bewilder them . They probe , not knowing what to expect from excess . They act out an experiment , a hairline calculation for survival : is the expenditure of energy to dig up carrots from the frozen ground more than their return in calories ? Did you notice the price tag when the wine was poured , the cool chardonnay , the special cabernet , white and red absurdities of words ? The motion lights are set to react outside the house but , tell me , did you see the clutter in the study , one would think ! Those catalogs , the cave , shadows .

Line : Assume you have discovered an entropy of spirit , immeasurable of course , but it pulls graveward all those whose element is breath , not as the in and out again of water and the sun , but oblivion 's ass - first downhill twenty - four - hour drag . Knowledge is an after - the - fact affair , fair game for a hunger striker 's skeptic gopher tooth . Remember your " agenbite of inwit , " but do n't , please do n't , go knocking on doors declaring you 've gone hollow with all the others , no one will believe you so long as your bag of flesh is fair . Fall down the stairs to another street . Have you noticed nature does not care for you , no matter the pathos of your fallacies , your antiperspirant , or you arms folded over the stretch marks of your hardest years ? That 's you , cell mate , roping a Platonic calf . Rare air , this is all you 'll catch and never can . Live on that for a week and leave a message on your machine , " nourished by words alone . " Those fireworks you inherited , where are they now ? Will you set them off to end the show ? You have a story that simply can not be sold , and no rewrite can change country or cast , so here you are in never - never land again . That figure off there in the mist is Nietzsche , stay clear , they say his breath is vile , he needs his space or so the professors say . Were you handed this out of an old script or are you improvising this to - do ? Whatever you are , an actor or a human merely with all the other actors , or can you tell the difference without a script in hand , you talk about a text that is not there . Each morning your own short - form obituary appears on every page . An open mike will follow . But this is only in the babblesphere , do n't inhale those dialogues that bubble up . Weariness grows in direct proportion to answers that recede nightly as you snore . Did you audition for this part or did you win it in an all - night poker game ? The difference is the same , none , today . Do n't give your chips to another to bet , that 's stacking the odds in your favor , sharing the blame . Avoid places where the lights are always on . Try finding a sunset through a simple gift of looking west . There can be too much light for your own good . Pace Pascal . Let someone close your eyes . Necessary , or so I 'm told . That hand in front of your face , try it now .

You have to suffer , you have to fill up in order to implode , to be recognized for the necessities of commerce . They unhinge , finally , the doors you walk through into phantom stairwells in telephonic hum smelling of wet coal and doll 's hair . Precipitous adjectives gush from a cracked faucet in the chancellery restroom . Someone is stifling laughter from underneath a card table where an electric utility had fallen from his sleeve . They say that trussed birds derive no pleasure from the music of mangled wagons and that gas seeps like a well - kept secret imperiling dust mites in the spleens of hooded maidens locked away from the light . Everything is descending , even the scholarship of the ancient adverbs . Mouths twist into almonds and you wonder how the noise can drown itself out with nothing but nouns and dinner plates and gallows , with history a hiccup waiting to happen .

Line : The world is a wound in my soul , and I have sought the living waters in meditation , and the angelical fountains in the desert of Beersheba for solitude , for what health there is in friendship comes when one is alone .  I shed tears on the Mount of Olives because people no longer care for each other , but my friends have lacked the character for the vigil . There is no Cana wine in human affections that are not always awake , for people who do not trouble about each other are foes .  It is humiliating being the lamb and bleating to each passerby , " Feed me ! " What is the use of saying that men are stones when I know I am going to try to turn them into bread .  I am afraid to say that people are truthful . When a man tells me he is honest I press my hand close to my heart where I keep my miserable wallet . If he says he has any goodness in him , I avoid him , for I trust nobody who has so little fear of the evils that grow and ripen in us while we imagine we have one virtuous trait . These demons lie in ambush in the thick , heady coverts of the blood , where hypocrisy and egoism fatten , waiting to mock or betray us in any moment of self - esteem .  I have no faith in a meek man , and regard anyone that shows a humble mien as one who is preparing to make an attack upon me , for there is some brutish , nether fault in starved vanity .  Yet once a friend leaned as gently on my coat as that disciple had on the bosom of the Saviour , and I went away , not knowing by his affection whether I was the John Christ was said to have loved most . I whispered thanks to my soul because he leaned upon me , for I shall never know who I am if I am not loved .

Line : Much flesh walks upon the earth void of heart and warm liver , for it is the spirit that dies soonest .  Some men have marshland natures with mist and sea - water in their intellects , and are as sterile as the Florida earth which De Soto found in those meager , rough Indian settlements , and their tongues are fierce , reedy arrows . They wound and bleed the spirit , and their oaks and chestnut trees and acorns are wild , and a terrible , barren wind from the Atlantic blows through their blood as pitiless as the primitive rivers De Soto 's soldiers could not ford .  Do not attempt to cross these mad , tumid rivers , boreal and brackish , for water is unstable , and you can not link yourself to it .  There are also inland , domestic men who are timid pulse and vetch , and though they may appear as stupid as poultry rooting in the mire , they are housed people , and they have orchards and good , tamed wine that makes men loving rather than predatory ; go to them , and take little thought of their ignorance which brings forth good fruits , for here you may eat and not be on guard for the preservation of your soul .  People who have domestic animals are patient , for atheism and the stony heart are the result of traveling : sorrow never goes anywhere . Were we as content as our forefathers were with labor in the fallow , or as a fuller with his cloth , or a drayman with his horses and mules , we would stay where we are , and that is praying .  There are men that are birds , and their raiment is trembling feathers , for they show their souls to everyone , and everything that is ungentle or untutored or evil or mockery is as a rude stone cast at them , and they suffer all day long , or as Paul remarks they are slain every moment .  God forgive me for my pride ; though I would relinquish my own birthright for that wretched pottage of lentils which is friendship , I mistrust every mortal .  Each day the alms I ask of heaven is not to have a new chagrin which is my daily bread .  December 1959

Line : First all belief is paradise . So pliable a medium . A time not very long . A transparency caused . A conveyance of rupture . A subtle transport . Scant and rare . Deep in the opulent morning , blissful regions , hard and slender . Scarce and scant . Quotidian and temperate . Begin afresh in the realms of the atmosphere , that encompasses the solid earth , the terraqueous globe that soars and sings , elevated and flimsy . Bright and hot . Flesh and hue . Our skies are inventions , durations , discoveries , quotas , forgeries , fine and grand . Fine and grand . Fresh and bright . Heavenly and bright . The day pours out space , a light red roominess , bright and fresh . Bright and oft . Bright and fresh . Sparkling and wet . Clamour and tint . We range the spacious fields , a battlement trick and fast . Bright and silver . Ribbons and failings . To and fro . Fine and grand . The sky is complicated and flawed and we 're up there in it , floating near the apricot frill , the bias swoop , near the sullen bloated part that dissolves to silver the next instant bronze but nothing that meaningful , a breach of greeny - blue , a syllable , we 're all across the swathe of fleece laid out , the fraying rope , the copper beech behind the aluminum catalpa that has saved the entire spring for this flight , the tops of these a part of the sky , the light wind flipping up the white undersides of leaves , heaven afresh , the brushed part behind , the tumbling . So to the heavenly rustling . Just stiff with ambition we range the spacious trees in earnest desire sure and dear . Brisk and west . Streaky and massed . Changing and appearing . First and last . This was made from Europe , formed from Europe , rant and roar . Fine and grand . Fresh and bright . Crested and turbid . Silver and bright . This was spoken as it came to us , to celebrate and tint , distinct and designed . Sure and dear . Fully designed . Dear afresh . So free to the showing . What we praise we believe , we fully believe . Very fine . Belief thin and pure and clear to the title . Very beautiful . Belief lovely and elegant and fair for the footing . Very brisk . Belief lively and quick and strong by the bursting . Very bright . Belief clear and witty and famous in impulse . Very stormy . Belief violent and open and raging from privation . Very fine . Belief intransigent after pursuit . Very hot . Belief lustful and eager and curious before beauty . Very bright . Belief intending afresh . So calmly and clearly . Just stiff with leaf sure and dear and appearing and last . With lust clear and scarce and appearing and last and afresh .

Line : I do n't usually talk to strangers , but it is four o'clock and I ca n't get a cab . I need a cab because I have packages , but it 's four o'clock and all the cabs are off duty . They are making a shift change . At the bus stop I say , It 's hard to get a cab now . The woman standing next to me glances over without turning her head . She faces the street where cab after cab drives by with its light off . She says , as if to anyone , It 's hard to live now . I do n't respond . Hers is an Operation Iraqi Freedom answer . The war is on and the Department of Homeland Security has decided we have an elevated national - threat level , a code - orange alert . I could say something , but my packages are getting heavier by the minute and besides , what is there to say since rhetorically it 's not about our oil under their sand but about freeing Iraqis from Iraqis and Osama is Saddam and Saddam is " that man who tried to kill my father " and the weapons of mass destruction are , well , invisible and Afghanistan is Iraq and Iraq is Syria and we see ourselves only through our own eyes and the British , but not the French , and Germany wo n't and Turkey wo n't join us but the coalition is inside Baghdad where the future is the threat the Americans feel they can escape though there is no escaping the Americans because war , this war , is about peace : " The war in Iraq is really about peace . Trying to make the world more peaceful . This victory in Iraq , when it happens , will make the world more peaceful . "

Line : It was not a romantic sentiment , nor self - determined ; rather , it was embarrassing . My love of spearheading , from introvert to extrovert , from cowardice to consequence , from the enjambment to the unspecified dunce . It was a sabotage , a reckless moment : a purulent , tawny decree . All temptation puzzled me and drew me in . I dropped out of a large life , I flew over exams , I punched out breakfast teachers with lunch money , toiling over the idea of belonging rather than over upward mobility . I understood how power flung outward into the troves of the cursed ( I felt cursed or troubled all of the time ) . I was n't bearing oranges , limes , or even lemons . All of it blurred together so that a mere suggestion made by an outside force was something to be freely ignored . I could nod off , I could misinterpret , it could be reconfigured as a negotiation . The fog felt like an aphorism . Never lifting , always dull , always an added pull . The tribunal cloud judged below , judged my direction . There was lying , conning , faking , elucidating in order to get away with undoing . I was interested in preserving yet I ca n't tell you if it felt sacred or befallen . Your anxiety might have represented a crushing faith or a character assassination , my own or someone else 's . Or a lack of grip on reality : the wet rip of the grocery bags all of it falling-- your body on all fours . Accumulating soot upon retrieval . There were downsides to feeling different so I huddled in the corner ( not a ball , not rocking ) . I felt friendless and yet social . I felt no aptitude towards refining a skill . However , words cut my brain into two brains with their precipice their demarcations , their incisions ( too strong a word ) . They held me captive against their edge , their influence : I felt like insinuating something delicate or dear . Now -- I am holding on -- trying to pay attention to the collusion that I mustbe playing over and over in my mind , and it was my mind , it needed me to leave everything outside , on the steps or in the sky , to feign exhaustion in order to meet an aberration , the one in the corner that felt large and carefree with its own vernacular sprawled with whitewash on bricks or floors or that ghastly far above that kept me standing very still but perhaps I was n't inactive , I was just interpreting what had already been an assumed boundary , immersed in its insularity and in what stuck to its roundedness .  for Katy Lederer
