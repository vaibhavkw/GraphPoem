mardohai simhon claimed the silk scarf he wore around his neck was a mirror . "look , " he said , "my head is separated from my body by a scarf . who dares give me the life if i say i walk with a knotted mirror under my chin ? " the scarf reflects a face , and you think it is of flesh . "night is the mirror . day the scarf . moon and sun reflected features . but my true face , brothers , where did i lose it ? " at his death , a large scar was discovered on his neck . the meaning of this anecdote was discussed by the rabbis . reb alphandery , in his authority as the oldest , spoke first . " a double mirror , " he said , " separates us from the lord so that god sees himself when trying to see us , and we , when trying to see him , see only our own face . " "is appearance no more than the reflections thrown back and forth by a set of mirrors ? " asked reb ephraim . "you are no doubt alluding to the soul , reb alphandery , in which we see ourselves mirrored . but the body is the place of the soul , just as the mountain is the bed of the brook . the body has broken the mirror . " " the brook , " continued reb alphandery , " sleeps on the summit . the brook 's dream is of water , as is the brook . it flows for us . our dreams extend us . "do you not remember this phrase of reb alsem 's : ' we live out the dream of creation , which is god 's dream . in the evening our own dreams snuggle down into it like sparrows in their nests . ' " and did not reb hames write : 'birds of night , my dreams explore the immense dream of the sleeping universe . '" "are dreams the limpid discourse between the facets of a crystal block ? " continued reb ephraim . " the world is of glass . you know it by its brilliance , night or day . " " the earth turns in a mirror . the earth turns in a scarf , " replied reb alphandery . " the scarf of a dandy with a nasty scar , " said reb ephraim . ( "words are inside breath , as the earth is inside time . " - reb mares ) and yukel said : " the bundle of the wandering jew contains the earth and more than one star . " "whatever contains is itself contained , " said reb mawas . the story i told you , as well as the commentaries it inspired , will be recorded in the book of the eye . the ladder urges us beyond ourselves . hence its importance . but in a void , where do we place it ? ( "god is sculpted . " - reb moyal ) @11@s
