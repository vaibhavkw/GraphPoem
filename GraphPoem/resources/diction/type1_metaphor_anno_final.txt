the old chronological towers are ash , are prisms of disfigurement , symbolic of a world cancelled by consumptive inmelodias . as for alchemical transition , we face the raising of new sea walls , of banished and re-engendered electorates , trying to cope with new intensities of weather , as the anomalous hypnotically increases with the power of inverse subjective . the body is now weighed on a broken axial cart , its blood conjoined as it rises within a nuclear darkness of ravens . so as piscean chronology now shatters , dawn becomes an unclaimed resurrection , a tumultuous eikon of skin no longer formed around its old dendritic artifacts . the calendar of draconian enfeeblement with its integers of the past 20 centuries , erased , its linear babels darkened by the extreme necessity for a new perpendicular burst , transmuting in demeanour , with history consumed in a roll of flaming aural dice , with its wizardry of tools subsumed in arcane vibration , turned into a power of splendiferous scorpions . the psychic wounds of the past eclipsed in this new millenium by the power of smelted dragon 's blood . and so , i speak of a new being of symbols , of lucid catacombs and spirals , its language being spun in fabulous iguana iridium . now , with the decayed constitutional stages exploded by telepathy , by invulnerable oneiric intuitives , the mental axis transmutes , like a reddened swan , with a new cosmic skeletal reprieve , afloat amongst the forces of the primeval lightning field , taking on the dharma of the great sustained emotion of eternity . @4@y

i love sweets , -- heaven would be dying on a bed of vanilla ice cream ... but my true self is thin , all profile and effortless gestures , the sort of blond elegant girl whose body is the image of her soul . -- my doctors tell me i must give up this ideal ; but i will not ... cannot . only to my husband i 'm not simply a " case . " but he is a fool . he married meat , and thought it was a wife . . . . why am i a girl ? i ask my doctors , and they tell me they do n't know , that it is just "given . " but it has such implications -- ; and sometimes , i even feel like a girl . . . . now , at the beginning of ellen 's thirty-second year , her physical condition has deteriorated still further . her use of laxatives increases beyond measure . every evening she takes sixty to seventy tablets of a laxative , with the result that she suffers tortured vomiting at night and violent diarrhea by day , often accompanied by a weakness of the heart . she has thinned down to a skeleton , and weighs only 92 pounds . . . . about five years ago , i was in a restaurant , eating alone with a book . i was not married , and often did that ... -- i 'd turn down dinner invitations , so i could eat alone ; i 'd allow myself two pieces of bread , with butter , at the beginning , and three scoops of vanilla ice cream , at the end , -- sitting there alone with a book , both in the book and out of it , waited on , idly watching people , -- when an attractive young man and woman , both elegantly dressed , sat next to me . she was beautiful -- ; with sharp , clear features , a good bone structure -- ; if she took her make-up off in front of you , rubbing cold cream again and again across her skin , she still would be beautiful -- more beautiful . and he , -- i could n't remember when i had seen a man so attractive . i did n't know why . he was almost a male version of her , -- i had the sudden , mad notion that i wanted to be his lover ... -- were they married ? were they lovers ? they did n't wear wedding rings . their behavior was circumspect . they discussed politics . they did n't touch ... -- how could i discover ? then , when the first course arrived , i noticed the way each held his fork out for the other to taste what he had ordered ... they did this again and again , with pleased looks , indulgent smiles , for each course , more than once for each dish -- ; much too much for just friends ... -- their behavior somehow sickened me ; the way each gladly put the food the other had offered into his mouth -- ; i knew what they were . i knew they slept together . an immense depression came over me ... -- i knew i could never with such ease allow another to put food into my mouth : happily myself put food into another 's mouth -- ; i knew that to become a wife i would have to give up my ideal . . . . even as a child , i saw that the "natural " process of aging is for one 's middle to thicken -- one 's skin to blotch ; as happened to my mother . and her mother . i loathed "nature . " at twelve , pancakes became the most terrible thought there is ... i shall defeat "nature . " in the hospital , when they weigh me , i wear weights secretly sewn into my belt . . . . january 16 . the patient is allowed to eat in her room , but comes readily with her husband to afternoon coffee . previously she had stoutly resisted this on the ground that she did not really eat but devoured like a wild animal . this she demonstrated with utmost realism .... her physical examination showed nothing striking . salivary glands are markedly enlarged on both sides . january 21 . has been reading faust again . in her diary , writes that art is the "mutual permeation " of the "world of the body " and the "world of the spirit " says that her own poems are "hospital poems ... weak -- without skill or perseverance ; only managing to beat their wings softly . " february 8. agitation , quickly subsided again . has attached herself to an elegant , very thin female patient . homo-erotic component strikingly evident . february 15 . vexation , and torment . says that her mind forces her always to think of eating . feels herself degraded by this . has entirely , for the first time in years , stopped writing poetry . . . . callas is my favorite singer , but i 've only seen her once -- ; i 've never forgotten that night ... -- it was in tosca , she had long before lost weight , her voice had been , for years , deteriorating , half itself ... when her career began , of course , she was fat , enormous -- ; in the early photographs , sometimes i almost do n't recognize her ... the voice too then was enormous -- healthy ; robust ; subtle ; but capable of crude effects , even vulgar , almost out of high spirits , too much health ... but soon she felt that she must lose weight , -- that all she was trying to express was obliterated by her body , buried in flesh -- ; abruptly , within four months , she lost at least sixty pounds ... -- the gossip in milan was that callas had swallowed a tapeworm . but of course she had n't . the tapeworm was her soul ... -- how her soul , uncompromising , insatiable , must have loved eating the flesh from her bones , revealing this extraordinarily mercurial ; fragile ; masterly creature ... -- but irresistibly , nothing stopped there ; the huge voice also began to change : at first , it simply diminished in volume , in size , then the top notes became shrill , unreliable -- at last , usually not there at all ... -- no one knows why . perhaps her mind , ravenous , still insatiable , sensed that to struggle with the shreds of a voice must make her artistry subtler , more refined , more capable of expressing humiliation , rage , betrayal ... -- perhaps the opposite . perhaps her spirit loathed the unending struggle to embody itself , to manifest itself , on a stage whose mechanics , and suffocating customs , seemed expressly designed to annihilate spirit ... -- i know that in tosca , in the second act , when , humiliated , hounded by scarpia , she sang vissi d'arte -- "i lived for art " -- and in torment , bewilderment , at the end she asks , with a voice reaching harrowingly for the notes , " art has repaid me like this ? " i felt i was watching autobiography -- an art ; skill ; virtuosity miles distant from the usual soprano 's athleticism , -- the usual musician 's dream of virtuosity without content ... -- i wonder what she feels , now , listening to her recordings . for they have already , within a few years , begun to date ... whatever they express they express through the style of a decade and a half -- ; a style she helped create ... -- she must know that now she probably would not do a trill in exactly that way , -- that the whole sound , atmosphere , dramaturgy of her recordings have just slightly become those of the past ... -- is it bitter ? does her soul tell her that she was an idiot ever to think anything material wholly could satisfy ? ... -- perhaps it says : the only way to escape the history of styles is not to have a body . . . . when i open my eyes in the morning , my great mystery stands before me ... -- i know that i am intelligent ; therefore the inability not to fear food day-and-night ; this unending hunger ten minutes after i have eaten ... a childish dread of eating ; hunger which can have no cause , -- half my mind says that all this is demeaning ... bread for days on end drives all real thought from my brain ... -- then i think , no . the ideal of being thin conceals the ideal not to have a body -- ; which is not trivial ... this wish seems now as much a "given " of my existence as the intolerable fact that i am dark-complexioned ; big-boned ; and once weighed one hundred and sixty-five pounds ... -- but then i think , no . that 's too simple , -- without a body , who can know himself at all ? only by acting ; choosing ; rejecting ; have i made myself -- discovered who and what ellen can be ... -- but then again i think , no . this i is anterior to name ; gender ; action ; fashion ; matter itself , -- ... trying to stop my hunger with food is like trying to appease thirst with ink . . . . march 30 . result of the consultation : both gentlemen agree completely with my prognosis and doubt any therapeutic usefulness of commitment even more emphatically than i . all three of us are agreed that it is not a case of obsessional neurosis and not one of manic-depressive psychosis , and that no definitely reliable therapy is possible . we therefore resolved to give in to the patient 's demand for discharge . . . . the train-ride yesterday was far worse than i expected ... in our compartment were ordinary people : a student ; a woman ; her child ; -- they had ordinary bodies , pleasant faces ; but i thought i was surrounded by creatures with the pathetic , desperate desire to be not what they were : -- the student was short , and carried his body as if forcing it to be taller -- ; the woman showed her gums when she smiled , and often held her hand up to hide them -- ; the child seemed to cry simply because it was small ; a dwarf , and helpless ... -- i was hungry . i had insisted that my husband not bring food ... after about thirty minutes , the woman peeled an orange to quiet the child . she put a section into its mouth -- ; immediately it spit it out . the piece fell to the floor . -- she pushed it with her foot through the dirt toward me several inches . my husband saw me staring down at the piece ... -- i did n't move ; how i wanted to reach out , and as if invisible shove it in my mouth -- ; my body became rigid . as i stared at him , i could see him staring at me , -- then he looked at the student -- ; at the woman -- ; then back to me ... i did n't move . -- at last , he bent down , and casually threw it out the window . he looked away . -- i got up to leave the compartment , then saw his face , -- his eyes were red ; and i saw -- i 'm sure i saw -- disappointment . . . . on the third day of being home she is as if transformed . at breakfast she eats butter and sugar , at noon she eats so much that -- for the first time in thirteen years ! -- she is satisfied by her food and gets really full . at afternoon coffee she eats chocolate creams and easter eggs . she takes a walk with her husband , reads poems , listens to recordings , is in a positively festive mood , and all heaviness seems to have fallen away from her . she writes letters , the last one a letter to the fellow patient here to whom she had become so attached . in the evening she takes a lethal dose of poison , and on the following morning she is dead . " she looked as she had never looked in life -- calm and happy and peaceful . " . . . dearest . -- i remember how at eighteen , on hikes with friends , when they rested , sitting down to joke or talk , i circled around them , afraid to hike ahead alone , yet afraid to rest when i was not yet truly thin . you and , yes , my husband , -- you and he have by degrees drawn me within the circle ; forced me to sit down at last on the ground . i am grateful . but something in me refuses it . -- how eager i have been to compromise , to kill this refuser , -- but each compromise , each attempt to poison an ideal which often seemed to me sterile and unreal , heightens my hunger . i am crippled . i disappoint you . will you greet with anger , or happiness , the news which might well reach you before this letter ? your ellen . @38@s

what can a yellow glove mean in a world of motorcars and governments ? i was small , like everyone . life was a string of precautions : do n't kiss the squirrel before you bury him , do n't suck candy , pop balloons , drop watermelons , watch tv. when the new gloves appeared one christmas , tucked in soft tissue , i heard it trailing me : do n't lose the yellow gloves . i was small , there was too much to remember . one day , waving at a stream -- the ice had cracked , winter chipping down , soon we would sail boats and roll into ditches -- i let a glove go . into the stream , sucked under the street . since when did streets have mouths ? i walked home on a desperate road . gloves cost money . we did n't have much . i would tell no one . i would wear the yellow glove that was left and keep the other hand in a pocket . i knew my mother 's eyes had tears they had not cried yet , i did n't want to be the one to make them flow . it was the prayer i spoke secretly , folding socks , lining up donkeys in windowsills . to be good , a promise made to the roaches who scouted my closet at night . if you do n't get in my bed , i will be good . and they listened . i had a lot to fulfill . the months rolled down like towels out of a machine . i sang and drew and fattened the cat . do n't scream , do n't lie , do n't cheat , do n't fight -- you could hear it anywhere . a pebble could show you how to be smooth , tell the truth . a field could show how to sleep without walls . a stream could remember how to drift and change -- next june i was stirring the stream like a soup , telling my brother dinner would be ready if he 'd only hurry up with the bread , when i saw it . the yellow glove draped on a twig . a muddy survivor . a quiet flag . where had it been in the three gone months ? i could wash it , fold it in my winter drawer with its sister , no one in that world would ever know . there were miracles on harvey street . children walked home in yellow light . trees were reborn and gloves traveled far , but returned . a thousand miles later , what can a yellow glove mean in a world of bankbooks and stereos ? part of the difference between floating and going down . @22@s

" i lis - ten to it differently now . i wait for the echo they tell me is there , preceding each note , and it 's as if i were experiencing the music a pri- ori . i listen to the chords or whole riffs bouncing off the walls versus sound in real time . doing so , i miss the actual song , which is also delayed because this is , after all , a recording . once , the concept of real time was redundant . before the first gramophone . before we learned to manipulate the speed of things to come . and long before that , the idea of a spirit that takes over for the temporary body was already popular . perhaps our first attempt to deny the unavoidable . one new religion offers immortality . for a price . unlike traditional religions in which death is a prerequisite , this one teaches the body to bypass the soul , that middle man who always gets in the way , and the here-and-now becomes a here-and-always . it 's all up here , one of its members says to me , pointing his index finger at his temple , as if mimicking a gun . i may actually want to die before i get old , i think , the radio as loud as it 'll go , one chord after another bouncing off the walls so many years ago at leeds , the road much longer than i 'd expected , the signal grow- ing weaker and one station giving way to another . from feedback to static to a preacher who invites me or commands me or dares me to lay my hands on the radio . both hands , he says . i raise my legs , raise my whole body ( although it 's not levitation or anything nearly as glam - orous ) to steady the steering wheel . 4 . in the book of ironies they forgot to write that a superstitious woman will end up marrying an atheist . curiously , in all the cases i know , it 's the man who does n't believe . the woman is always open at the very least to the possibility of that " something out there . " at times her superstitions are proof of god 's constant tinkering with the cogs and wheels of the soul . there are atheists with proof of a finite world , atheists in need of a finite world , reformed atheists whose image of god has become so pure over the years that it has gone from inevitable to unnecessary to simply impossible . one believer argues that only the next life makes this one tolerable and lends it purpose , that only the idea of being part of something cir- cular can keep us from going mad , because true madness is linear and the points at either end are clearly defined . this is an uncom - fortable thought for her . i wonder if her belief is , more than any- thing , a way to keep at bay this linear derangement . the atheist lying beside her is beginning to sink into sleep when she speaks : she has carefully chosen this moment , thinking he 's vulnerable enough to say what she wants to hear . he sits on the edge of the bed and won- ders for a moment what it would be like to take that leap forward ; or backward , which is something she does n't mention : believers of her kind tend to discount any previous incarnations , as if eternity began here . being here , he says to himself as he has said to her so many times , is the point . then he tries to think his way back to sleep : wedding band , crown , zero , smoke ring , lasso , hula hoop . @1022@s

1 . when handling the past in the present tense , chronology is of the utmost importance . suppose i say i 'm eight years old and all the rooms of my father 's house are larger than life . then i say two days after my first divorce , the only landscape i know is simplified , bone-smooth . the past remains practically undisturbed . but suppose i reverse the order in which the episodes are recreated , and time goes on a rampage , and i find myself coming and going . journeys on land have a spherical tendency because this is always at some level the nature of the ter- rain . the anthill crumbles in the rain and the ants returning with more provisions walk past the leveled mound ; having noticed noth - ing , they keep looking for home . though each mouth carries its crumb of substance , tradition and evolution will see to it that it is n't eaten until the journey has been completed . it 's not unusual for the ants to walk repeatedly over the ruins . a squirrel chases itself so fast around the trunk of a palm tree that it appears to be standing still , like propeller blades in midflight .

dear miss , first of all i want to say that i have enjoyed the imaginary possibility , built of course on the fact that such possibility does exist in nature : i have seen the birds and other forms of nonhumanity occur in such postures that must be with men and women ....i have imagined myself in such postures with you , where flight was discouraged only by the inherent possibility of the firm horizontal ... as men give vast lands to little papers with line and color , i have imagined more on the surface of your body , giving all the universe in this model .... yet , i must be curious about your breasts ...curious ...hungry is the word , to see , to touch , to taste ....i am curious as to how your hands undress your body . i am interested in your mind : will you undress in front of me ? will you permit me the unparalleled pleasure of taking your clothes off ? i feel that if i should have my penis in your vagina i should have your love ; for you do not receive the wretched hardness of my desire into the sweet body of yourself without that you have not come to love me for reasons , if love has reasons , i cannot tell .... your admirer @120@s

jesse patrick ferguson is a canadian visual poet working in both visual and textual forms . his "mama " shows how little text it takes to make a successful visual poem . consisting of nothing but the letter "e , " variously presented , this poem represents the simple warbling cry of a child . the poem is both a touching visualization of an aural event and a strong example of how xerographic transmogrification can add character and meaning to text . -- geof huth more about visual poetry >> @3@
gustave morin 's primary form is the collage poem . his " toon tune " is a remarkable piece of craftsmanship . its sixty-three individual fragments of text are cut into the shapes of jigsaw puzzle pieces and are fit perfectly together in a rectangular grid . the "words " of the poem consist almost entirely of the extravagant visualizations of onomatopoeia from comic books , producing a visual symphony of crashes and cries . -- geof huth more about visual poetry >> @5@

master hirano came from japan together with a priest from the kegon sect and the two of them drank beer all night at the avia hotel next to ben gurion airport . the following day , when we came to take them to the galilee , they had trouble getting up and barely checked out of their rooms on time . it was a wintry january morning , and near the village of shefaram the priest from the kegon sect asked us to stop and stood by the side of the road and urinated . on friday the two of them ( master hirano and the priest from the kegon sect ) went to the bratslav hasids ' synagogue in safed . the worshippers swayed like trees in the wind . master hirano and the priest from the kegon sect stood there , bald and wrapped in robes , behind the congregation , and the beadle whispered into our ears : are they jews ? are they jews ? when we left the synagogue master hirano said to the priest from the kegon sect : there is no doubt that they understand what devotion ( he said shujaku ) is . the priest from the kegon sect said : there is no doubt . they know what devotion is . on jerusalem street , by the monument of the mortar , commemorating the '48 war , master hirano said : prayer is a good thing . the priest from the kegon sect said : there is no doubt . prayer is a good thing . master hirano stood on one side of the mortar and the priest from the kegon sect stood on the other and the moon rose , big and full , yellow like the fields painted by van gogh . * * * it 's possible to write only by means of non-writing . when things come from the opposite direction . my aunt edith rises out of the ground and returns to her bed in the nursing home . ursula , my stepmother , is walking backward . all sorts of wilted flowers bring their petals toward themselves . all we need is yogurt and a spoon . we 'll know what to do with the spoon . we 'll lead it toward the right place ( which is to say , the yogurt ) and from there toward the mouth . but the mouth ca n't be fathomed . likewise the word that stands for it ( mouth ) is strange in the extreme . or take , for example , the hand that 's holding the spoon with its five tragic fingers . there 's no logic whatsoever in there being five . like five widows who 've gathered because their husbands have died , and they allow themselves this movement through the air in order to keep from losing their minds . there is no limit to the beauty of things that are sad . like old clay vases or a wagon 's shaft in a junkyard . every year the plum trees flower anew , and people whose names are shtiasni or dahaan open doors and close them . all these things fill the heart with great joy . the beauty of death and the violet colors accompanying it . announcements that make nothing dawn on one , and the dawn itself rising from nowhere like a birthday present 365 days a year . @527@

a million years ago the earth grew cold . iowa was covered by twenty-five hundred feet of ice . no one knows why the glaciers formed and spread , or why they eventually retreated . i blinked and you were gone . as a boy , he loved the idea of the ice age . lumbering woolly mammoths and giant sloths . outside , a vast white edict erasing the landscape . inside his head , cave paintings of bison leapt in the firelight , their horns spiraling upward , the tips smoking . men on skis came to dig you out . though they worked all night , they were too late . waking every day the frost reasserts itself . its relentlessness a tedium , a closure . the earth must have looked more familiar when all was water . we do n't recognize ourselves amidst this overwhelming winter : static that censors newscasts , cold that burns , incessant dripping as icicles perfect themselves . the night skies are a riot of chinese silk : bolts of crimson and shadow-blue . the radio crackles faintly . medical refuse litters the beaches , spews into the water from a backed up sewer under the pier . bacteria cavort in the seawater . the weather 's gone haywire all over the globe . the more sensitive you are the earlier you 'll die . just hold your breath a little longer , dear . once you start this medication , you ca n't stop . your life changes . you decide , based on a dearth of information , which force you want to submit to : nature , now less maternal than ever , or her idiot son -- modern medicine . you make an effort to find some grand design in this blindness . if you ca n't see well enough anymore to edit your film , perhaps you can still do the music . you set an example . lemme outa here . as a boy , before his mother found out and made him stop , he 'd bury the frozen birds he found on the porch after big storms by warming the earth first with his father 's blowtorch . being human , we ca n't help attempting to arrange events into patterns -- the way a sick man sees faces in the stains on his bedroom ceiling . he names them . months later , they all converse . the men in the ice-covered radio station play cards and drink bourbon . what defense can one mount against an avalanche ? spotless beakers , pipettes , rows of small cages . welcome to the lab . here 's the chamber where we run preliminary screenings . better don these gloves . why not use two pair , like me ? the new man on the night shift nods off over his work , with the radio playing . its tinny strands of music enter his dream disguised as a dead friend 's hair . he had short coarse hair , like a terrier 's , pleasantly stiff to the touch . the lab is brightly lit to ward off the backwash of night . under the table the research assistant 's feet twitch spasmodically in his sleep. a series of blurry black-and-white newsreels flickers on the screen . martian canals overflow their banks . a lake in africa exhales a cloud of poison gas , killing thousands of villagers on its shores . venice sinks . anchorage , alaska , is leveled by earthquakes . pompeii is breaded and fried by its volcano . the swamp swallows another sand bar , then coughs up a tiny island . subzero temperatures paralyze acapulco . there have been several ice ages , a female narrator intones . the most recent lasted 90,000 years . a timer goes off and the lab assistant jerks awake . in about the time it takes to drink a glass of water , he remembers where he is . " this is probably the last time i will write to you . . . " the rocks applaud . summers turn short and cool . the world remakes itself without us now . @171@

in cities there are tangerine briefcases on the down-platform and jet parkas on the up-platform ; in the mother of cities there is equal anxiety at all terminals . west a business breast , north a morose jig , east a false escape , south steam in milk . the centres of cities move westwards ; the centre of the mother of cities has disappeared . north the great cat , east the great water , south the great fire , west the great arrow . in cities the sons of women become fathers ; in the mother of cities the daughters of men have failed to become mothers . east the uneager fingers , south the damp cave , west the chained ankle , north the rehearsed cry . cities are built for trade , where women and men may freely through knowing each other become more like themselves ; the mother of cities is built for government , where women and men through fearing each other become more like each other than they care to be . south the short , west the soap , north the sheets , east the shivers . in cities the church fund is forever stuck below blood heat ; in the mother of cities the church is a community arts centre . west the why-not , north the now-then , east the end - product , south the same-again . in cities nobody can afford the price ; in the mother of cities nobody dares to ask the price . north the telephone smile , east the early appointment , south the second reminder , west the hanging button . in cities the jealous man is jealous because he is himself in his imagination unfaithful ; in the mother of cities the jealous man is jealous because he reads the magazines . east the endless arrival , south the astounding statistic , west the wasted words , north the night of nights . in cities we dream about our desires ; in the mother of cities we dream about our dreams . @214@

reason looks for where i woke and was awake , in the two , then room fitting the wall , withdrawn , i arranges it had my desk and thus my corner . from there while waiting , waltz . the soles of our boots wear thin , but the soles of our feet grow thick . the difference between "he presented his argument " and " they had an argument . " i still respond to the academic year , the sound of the school bell , the hot wednesday morn - ing after labor day . must the physiologist stand apart from the philosopher . we are not forgetting the patience of the mad , their love of detail . the sudden brief early morning breeze , the first indication of a day 's palpability , stays high in the trees , while flashing silver and green the leaves flutter , a bird sweeps from one branch to another , the indistinct shadows lift off the crumpled weeds , smoke rises from the gravel quarry -- -- all this is metonymy . the "argument " is the plot , proved by the book . going forward and coming back later . even posterity , alas , will know sears . as for we who "love to be astonished , " there are fences keeping cyclones . might be covered , on the ground , by no distance . she spread her fingers as she spoke , talking of artifice , which extends beauty beyond nature . perhaps it is only a coincidence . for , as neitzsche put it , "if a man has character , he will have the same experience over and over again . " in the morning at eight i sense the first threat of monotony . give a penny with a knife . candor is the high pitch of scrutiny . i was tired of ideas , or , rather , the activity of ideas , a kind of exercise , had first invigorated me and then made me sleepy , so that i felt just as one does after a long , early morning walk , returning unable to decide whether to drink more coffee or go back to sleep. the uncommon run of keeping oneself to oneself . the piggy-back plant is o.k . tell anyone who telephones that i 'm not home . i liked doing that , had made rooms for dolls on trucks that way , looking in on them through windows . it was a pretense of keeping our distance from anything that ap - peared pretentious . a sorry mess , but well-framed . as if a contorted checkerboard formed the portrait of a handsome woman in a hat of several ochres and umbers . the dog circles more than a moth before resting . let the traffic pass . they were on vacation and therefore bored . someone wanted to go away from everywhere forever but jumped into the bay . we were warned such accidents happen while mothers talk on phones . a doodled gnarled tree . milk belongs to the mythology of cats but it makes them sick . ours was a stray with ringworm . one night each year on boston 's beacon hill the curtains remained undrawn and the public was invited to peek in . i did n't wear my dark glasses because i did n't want a raccoon tan . yet this needs shading in . it seemed that i did n't , after all , want a birthday empty of sentimentality . it 's on the compulsive buyer 's rack up front . the real adversary of my determination was determinism , regulating and limiting the range and degree of difference between things of one day and things of the next . i got it from darwin , freud , and marx . not fragments but metonymy . duration . language makes tracks . @621@

1 . is it true that they dream ? it is true , for the spaces of night surround them with shape and purpose , like a warm hollow below the shoulders , or between the curve of thigh and belly . the land itself can lie like this . hence our understanding of giants . the wind and the grass cry out to the arms of their sleep as the shore cries out , and buries its face in the bruised sea . we all have heard barns and fences splintering against the dark with a weight that is more than wood . the stars , too , bear witness . we can read their tails and claws as we would read the signs of our own dreams ; a knot of sheets , scratches defining the edges of the body , the position of the legs upon waking . the cage and the forest are as helpless in the night as a pair of open hands holding rain . 2. do they dream of the past or of the future ? think of the way a woman who wanders the roads could step into an empty farmhouse one afternoon and find a basket of eggs , some unopened letters , the pillowcases embroidered with initials that once were hers . think of her happiness as she sleeps in the daylilies ; the air is always heaviest at the start of dusk . cows , for example , find each part of themselves traveling at a different rate of speed . their bells call back to their burdened hearts the way a sparrow taunts an old hawk . as far as the badger and the owl are concerned , the past is a silver trout circling in the ice . each night he swims through their waking and makes his way back to the moon . clouds file through the dark like prisoners through an endless yard . deer are made visible by their hunger . i could also mention the hopes of common spiders : green thread sailing from an infinite spool , a web , a thin nest , a child dragging a white rope slowly through the sand . 3. do they dream of this world or of another ? the prairie lies open like a vacant eye , blind to everything but the wind . from the tall grass the sky is an industrious map that bursts with rivers and cities . a black hawk waltzes against his clumsy wings , the buzzards grow bored with the dead . a screendoor flapping idly on an august afternoon or a woman fanning herself in church ; this is how the tails of snakes and cats keep time even in sleep. there are sudden flashes of light to account for . alligators , tormented by knots and vines , take these as a sign of grace . eagles find solace in the far glow of towns , in the small yellow bulb a child keeps by his bed . the lightning that scars the horizon of the meadow is carried in the desperate gaze of foxes . have other skies fallen into this sky ? all the evidence seems to say so . conspiracy of air , conspiracy of ice , the silver trout is thirsty for morning , the prairie dog shivers with sweat . skeletons of gulls lie scattered on the dunes , their beaks still parted by whispering . these are the languages that fall beyond our hearing . imagine the way rain falls around a house at night , invisible to its sleepers . they do not dream of us . 4 . how can we learn more ? this is all we will ever know . @292@
