in the morning of the tribe this name ancapagari was given to these mountains . the name , then alive , spread into the world and never returned . ancapagari : no foot-step ever spoken , no mule deer killed from its foothold , left for dead . ancapagari opened the stones . pine roots gripped peak rock with their claws . water dug into the earth and vanished , boiling up again in another place . the water was bitten by aspen , generations of aspen shot their light colored trunks into space . ancapagari . at that time , if the whisper was in your mouth , you were lighted . now these people are buried . the root-taking , finished . buried in everything , thousands taken root . the roots swell , nesting . openings widen for the roots to surface . they sway within you in steady wind of your breath . you are forever swinging between this being and another , one being and another . there is a word for it crawling in your mouth each night . speak it . ancapagari has circled , returned to these highlands . the yellow pines deathless , the sparrow hawks scull , the waters are going numb . ancapagari longs to be spoken in each tongue . it is the name of the god who has come from among us . @129@

( this was melted down in those days when terror struck . ) in this turreted place we have shaved the graceful neck and head of marie antoinette , ripped her white , ruffled collar wide and wrapped the cuff of rope about her hands behind her back . we made her face the casual knitting women and men making fists sitting on steps in the "may court " ( where a fresh tree was placed each spring by the lawyers ' clerks ! ) on her way to the guillotine . its blade was heavy as primeval stone : she , the chemist lavoisier , charlotte corday , poet and brother andre chenier , madame du barry -- all 2600 who died , having said their last farewells in the women 's courtyard , twelve per day underneath the blade ! and some were disemboweled beside . was there sometimes an image of beauty in their minds at the last ? perhaps on white sands beside the blue-black sea a matched pair of roan horses galloping together in the bright spume , riderless . or a nude young man and woman lying together touching in a field of flowers ? 6 nearby on this island the gargoyles of notre dame gawk in ancient horror and some forever gnaw on stone rabbits in the parapets or wail in winged , formal misery outside the set limits of the orthodox church -- all glory happening within the walls where they squat : so hunched , so beaked , so horrorstruck . 7 a wing of the may courtyard where the condemned waited "monsieur de paris " as executioners were named now adjoins the building of glass and light , with no walls , it seems , jewel of sainte chapelle , its windows of rose and blue , gold , green , yellow , purple , rising fifty feet : its spire piercing the foliate , layered , many-colored egg of the vault of heaven , showering all the primal hues and shadows given -- bright as the truth reflected in a drop of fresh blood or the colors of the body 's inner organs hid - den before the sure explosion of light that hits them at the moment of violent death . -- this is a time like that of the sun that once a year , just at the dawn of winter solstice , lights up an ancient celtic stone grave , striking the bones spread on shelves with all the colors of the flesh . 8 who can stand these juxtapositions of person and place and time ? i walk across the bridge of change where i have so often watched by the towers of the conciergerie . now , water laves a little higher up the stair from the river to the quay , hiding some of the steps from me . boats nudge at the edge . i walk along the boulevard past the great gold and blue corner clock , the ornate wrought-iron gate and fence of the place of justice ( its name changed from the time of kings ) , past the shadow and spire of sainte chapelle . i cross the bridge of saint michel into the latin quarter . but i do not look for the street of the cat who fishes or the street of the harp . i turn right , wandering a bit , and suddenly , as if by chance , find myself at this street , and here i will wait , for it is our street , rue git le coeur : here lies the heart . for roger aplon -- 1975 @78@

what can a yellow glove mean in a world of motorcars and governments ? i was small , like everyone . life was a string of precautions : do n't kiss the squirrel before you bury him , do n't suck candy , pop balloons , drop watermelons , watch tv. when the new gloves appeared one christmas , tucked in soft tissue , i heard it trailing me : do n't lose the yellow gloves . i was small , there was too much to remember . one day , waving at a stream -- the ice had cracked , winter chipping down , soon we would sail boats and roll into ditches -- i let a glove go . into the stream , sucked under the street . since when did streets have mouths ? i walked home on a desperate road . gloves cost money . we did n't have much . i would tell no one . i would wear the yellow glove that was left and keep the other hand in a pocket . i knew my mother 's eyes had tears they had not cried yet , i did n't want to be the one to make them flow . it was the prayer i spoke secretly , folding socks , lining up donkeys in windowsills . to be good , a promise made to the roaches who scouted my closet at night . if you do n't get in my bed , i will be good . and they listened . i had a lot to fulfill . the months rolled down like towels out of a machine . i sang and drew and fattened the cat . do n't scream , do n't lie , do n't cheat , do n't fight -- you could hear it anywhere . a pebble could show you how to be smooth , tell the truth . a field could show how to sleep without walls . a stream could remember how to drift and change -- next june i was stirring the stream like a soup , telling my brother dinner would be ready if he 'd only hurry up with the bread , when i saw it . the yellow glove draped on a twig . a muddy survivor . a quiet flag . where had it been in the three gone months ? i could wash it , fold it in my winter drawer with its sister , no one in that world would ever know . there were miracles on harvey street . children walked home in yellow light . trees were reborn and gloves traveled far , but returned . a thousand miles later , what can a yellow glove mean in a world of bankbooks and stereos ? part of the difference between floating and going down . @134@

man , he said , sitting on the steps your car sure needs a wash and wax job i can do it for you for 5 bucks , i got the wax , i got the rags , i got everything i need . i gave him the 5 and went upstairs . when i came down 4 hours later he was sitting on the steps drunk and offered me a can of beer . he said he 'd get the car the next day . the next day he got drunk again and i loaned him a dollar for a bottle of wine . his name was mike a world war ii veteran . his wife worked as a nurse . the next day i came down and he was sitting on the steps and he said , you know , i been sitting here looking at your car , wondering just how i was gonna do it , i wanna do it real good . the next day mike said it looked like rain and it sure as hell would n't make any sense to wash and wax a car when it was gonna rain . the next day it looked like rain again . and the next . then i did n't see him anymore . a week later i saw his wife and she said , they took mike to the hospital , he 's all swelled-up , they say it 's from the drinking . listen , i told her , he said he was going to wax my car , i gave him 5 dollars to wax my car . he 's in the critical ward , she said , he might die . . . i was sitting in their kitchen drinking with his wife when the phone rang . she handed the phone to me . it was mike . listen , he said , come down and get me , i ca n't stand this place . i drove on down there , walked into the hospital , walked up to his bed and said , let 's go mike . they would n't give him his clothes so mike walked to the elevator in his gown . we got on and there was a kid driving the elevator and eating a popsicle . nobody 's allowed to leave here in a gown , he said . you just drive this thing , kid , i said , we 'll worry about the gown . mike was all puffed-up , triple size but i got him into the car somehow and gave him a cigarette . i stopped at the liquor store for 2 six packs then went on in . i drank with mike and his wife until 11 p.m. then went upstairs . . . where 's mike ? i asked his wife 3 days later , you know he said he was going to wax my car . mike died , she said , he 's gone . you mean he died ? i asked . yes , he died , she said . i 'm sorry , i said , i 'm very sorry it rained for a week after that and i figured the only way i 'd get the 5 back was to go to bed with his wife but you know she moved out 2 weeks later an old guy with white hair moved in there and he had one blind eye and played the french horn . there was no way i could make it with him . @385@

" at times her superstitions are proof of god 's constant tinkering with the cogs and wheels of the soul . there are atheists with proof of a finite world , atheists in need of a finite world , reformed atheists whose image of god has become so pure over the years that it has gone from inevitable to unnecessary to simply impossible . one believer argues that only the next life makes this one tolerable and lends it purpose , that only the idea of being part of something cir- cular can keep us from going mad , because true madness is linear and the points at either end are clearly defined . this is an uncom - fortable thought for her . i wonder if her belief is , more than any- thing , a way to keep at bay this linear derangement . the atheist lying beside her is beginning to sink into sleep when she speaks : she has carefully chosen this moment , thinking he 's vulnerable enough to say what she wants to hear . he sits on the edge of the bed and won- ders for a moment what it would be like to take that leap forward ; or backward , which is something she does n't mention : believers of her kind tend to discount any previous incarnations , as if eternity began here . being here , he says to himself as he has said to her so many times , is the point . then he tries to think his way back to sleep : wedding band , crown , zero , smoke ring , lasso , hula hoop . @560@

dear miss , first of all i want to say that i have enjoyed the imaginary possibility , built of course on the fact that such possibility does exist in nature : i have seen the birds and other forms of nonhumanity occur in such postures that must be with men and women ....i have imagined myself in such postures with you , where flight was discouraged only by the inherent possibility of the firm horizontal ... as men give vast lands to little papers with line and color , i have imagined more on the surface of your body , giving all the universe in this model .... yet , i must be curious about your breasts ...curious ...hungry is the word , to see , to touch , to taste ....i am curious as to how your hands undress your body . i am interested in your mind : will you undress in front of me ? will you permit me the unparalleled pleasure of taking your clothes off ? i feel that if i should have my penis in your vagina i should have your love ; for you do not receive the wretched hardness of my desire into the sweet body of yourself without that you have not come to love me for reasons , if love has reasons , i cannot tell .... your admirer @221@
the turtle carries his house on his back . he is both the house and the person of that house . but actually , under the shell is a little room where the true turtle , wearing long underwear , sits at a little table . at one end of the room a series of levers sticks out of slots in the floor , like the controls of a steam shovel . it is with these that the turtle controls the legs of his house . most of the time the turtle sits under the sloping ceiling of his turtle room reading catalogues at the little table where a candle burns . he leans on one elbow , and then the other . he crosses one leg , and then the other . finally he yawns and buries his head in his arms and sleeps . if he feels a child picking up his house he quickly douses the candle and runs to the control levers and activates the legs of his house and tries to escape . if he cannot escape he retracts the legs and withdraws the so-called head and waits . he knows that children are careless , and that there will come a time when he will be free to move his house to some secluded place , where he will relight his candle , take out his catalogues and read until at last he yawns . then he 'll bury his head in his arms and sleep....that is , until another child picks up his house .... @101@

the curtains part : it is a summer 's day . there a cow on a grassy slope watches as a bull charges an old aeroplane in a meadow . the bull is punching holes with its horns in the aeroplane 's fabric... suddenly the aeroplane 's engine ignites ; the meadow is dark blue smoke ... the aeroplane shifts round and faces the charging bull . as the bull comes in the propeller takes off the end of its muzzle . the bloody nostrils , a ring through them , are flung to the grass with a shattered blossom of teeth . the bull , blood oozing from the stump of its face , backs off , and charges again . this time the propeller catches the bull behind its lower jaw and flings the head into a tree . the headless bull backs off once more , and then charges down again . the propeller beating at the headless bull , cutting the body away in a great halo of blood , until only the back legs are standing . these run widely away through the meadow in figure eights and zigzags , until at last they find the aeroplane again . and as they come running down the propeller whacks them apart . the legs , one with the tail still attached to it , the other somehow retaining both rectum and testicles , scamper off in opposite directions . the aeroplane turns away ; the engine stops . the shadows are suddenly seen in lengthened form . the watching cow begins to low ... @126@

heaven was originally precisely that : the starry sky , dating back to the earliest egyptian texts , which include magic spells that enable the soul to be sewn in the body of the great mother , nut , literally "night , " like the seed of a plant , which is also a jewel and a star . the greek elysian fields derive from the same celestial topography : the egyptian "field of rushes , " the eastern stars at dawn where the soul goes to be purified . that there is another , mirror world , a world of light , and that this world is simply the sky -- and a step further , the breath of the sky , the weather , the very air -- is a formative belief of great antiquity that has continued to the present day with the godhead becoming brightness itself : dios ( greek ) ; deus ( latin ) ; devas ( sanskrit ) ; daha (arabic ) ; day ( english ) . -- susan brind morrow , wolves and honey @147@

at the carnival , robo-boy sees only things he recognizes . the ferris wheel is an overgrown version of his own bells and whistle eyes . his flashers , his mother calls them . the tilt-a-whirl is the angle his head tilts when the flirt program goes into effect , usually in the vicinity of a cindy or a carrie , though once he found himself tilting at the school librarian which caused him to wheel in reverse into the civil war section knocking over a cart of books that were waiting to be shelved under b . there 's a dangerously low stratosphere of pink cotton-candy clouds being carried around by the children . if robo-boy goes near them , the alarms will go off . it 's the kind of sticky that would cause joint-lock for sure . in a darker , safer corner robo-boy finds the whack-a-mole game . he pays a dollar and starts whacking the plastic moles on their heads each time they pop up from the much-dented log . he wins bear after bear . it 's only when he 's lugging them home , the largest one skidding face-down along the sidewalk getting dirt on its white nose and light blue belly , that he remembers the program : wac-a-mole realism(tm ) -- the disc on the installer 's desk . suddenly it all fits together : the way a deliciously strange thought will start wafting out of his unconscious -- and then wham , it disappears . @199@

master hirano came from japan together with a priest from the kegon sect and the two of them drank beer all night at the avia hotel next to ben gurion airport . the following day , when we came to take them to the galilee , they had trouble getting up and barely checked out of their rooms on time . it was a wintry january morning , and near the village of shefaram the priest from the kegon sect asked us to stop and stood by the side of the road and urinated . on friday the two of them ( master hirano and the priest from the kegon sect ) went to the bratslav hasids ' synagogue in safed . the worshippers swayed like trees in the wind . master hirano and the priest from the kegon sect stood there , bald and wrapped in robes , behind the congregation , and the beadle whispered into our ears : are they jews ? are they jews ? when we left the synagogue master hirano said to the priest from the kegon sect : there is no doubt that they understand what devotion ( he said shujaku ) is . the priest from the kegon sect said : there is no doubt . they know what devotion is . on jerusalem street , by the monument of the mortar , commemorating the '48 war , master hirano said : prayer is a good thing . the priest from the kegon sect said : there is no doubt . prayer is a good thing . master hirano stood on one side of the mortar and the priest from the kegon sect stood on the other and the moon rose , big and full , yellow like the fields painted by van gogh . * * * it 's possible to write only by means of non-writing . when things come from the opposite direction . my aunt edith rises out of the ground and returns to her bed in the nursing home . ursula , my stepmother , is walking backward . all sorts of wilted flowers bring their petals toward themselves . all we need is yogurt and a spoon . we 'll know what to do with the spoon . we 'll lead it toward the right place ( which is to say , the yogurt ) and from there toward the mouth . but the mouth ca n't be fathomed . likewise the word that stands for it ( mouth ) is strange in the extreme . or take , for example , the hand that 's holding the spoon with its five tragic fingers . there 's no logic whatsoever in there being five . like five widows who 've gathered because their husbands have died , and they allow themselves this movement through the air in order to keep from losing their minds . there is no limit to the beauty of things that are sad . like old clay vases or a wagon 's shaft in a junkyard . every year the plum trees flower anew , and people whose names are shtiasni or dahaan open doors and close them . all these things fill the heart with great joy . the beauty of death and the violet colors accompanying it . announcements that make nothing dawn on one , and the dawn itself rising from nowhere like a birthday present 365 days a year . @540@

1 . i know that language is within the world and that , at the same time , the world is within language . i know we are at the border between language and the world . 2. i do n't like phrases such as "nothing new under the sun " or "it 's all been said already . " i know that at every moment we could affirm : "everything is always new under the sun " or "almost nothing has yet been said of what could be said . " 3. i know that there 's no true coherence except in apparent incoherence . every object clothes itself in chaos . to take shape , every thought must manage its own vagueness . 4 . among the obvious : i know that every human activity consists , one way or another , of battling death . 5 . i know that time is bound up with space . time is the shadow of space . space the shadow of time . i know that we live in the shadow of a shadow and that it returns to the light . 6 . i know that i know nothing about love . 7. i know that i live not in the world , but in the shadow of the world . i know that i go through the world the way an insect goes through its entire life in the shadow of a bank . 8. i know that nothing is simple . or more , that what 's simple is never truly , never completely , so . i know that everything adds up and that every element of this total depends on the whole . 9 . i know that everything around me is nothing but a mass of contingency . i know that every word props itself up on an immense architecture of contingency . 10 . i know that thunder comes after lightning and sometimes , in my dreams , thunder precedes lightning . i know that to see its opposite simultaneously with every phenomenon you must widen your eyes . 11 . i know that whoever finds himself loses himself a little . 12 . i know that i love a woman enormously , but i do n't know which one . 13 . i know that to talk is to walk a path with emptiness to the right and emptiness to the left . i know that nothing can grasp this path with two ends . i know that writing is talking in frozen time . 14 . i know that the word "table " is like a thousand tables . that a phrase is like a thousand thousand phrases . and that thinking is a match for water sports . 15 . i know that every authentic poet is in decay . 16 . to read is n't necessarily to analyze , is not necessarily " to understand . " at the swimming pool , we do n't ask the swimmer the composition of the water , the number and distribution of swimmers , or why he 's picked this date to go swimming . we do n't ask him to describe , in mid-crawl , the architecture or acoustics of the place , or to explain a bird trapped under its roof , or to do a better imitation of the progress of some olympic seal . we do n't ask him to memorize opening hours or screw himself up by whistling from the bench throughout an entire race in butterfly stroke . no . finally , we do n't ask him , before each dive , to bring up some secret meaning from the very bottom of the pool . no . we let swimmers swim . we let swimmers swim . and the swimming pools fill up . 17 . i know that i live and think inside a storehouse of books . some recent , new , remarkable books , but in the great majority books which are decayed , moldy , have turned to the lightest heaps of dust . only their metal frames and some fine particles of knowledge remain , unusable . light from a few windows crosses the storehouse unimpeded . 18 . having found some daguerreotypes on the floor of an attic -- portraits eroded by time and light -- i know that forgetting is something enormous , that forgetting is our highest destiny . 19 . i know that god does n't exist . that 's written everywhere in the storehouse -- it can be made out through the portholes , too . i know that after death there 's nothing but death . 20 . i know that , seen from the border between language and the world , the universe is in increasing entropy . but i no longer know what it is if i climb to the top of a tree ( one of these trees on the border between language and the world ) , from where you can see far into language and far into the world at the same time . 21 . because i have scaled a tree , i know that beyond language is a huge plain , with dark flowers and little mazy footpaths . @336@

foreword to "dancing on the grave of a son of a bitch " this poem is more properly a "dance poem " than a song or chant because the element of repetition is created by movements of language rather than duplicating words and sounds . however , it is in the spirit of ritual recitation that i wrote it  a performance to drive away bad spirits perhaps . the story behind the poem is this : a man and woman who have been living together for some time separate . part of the pain of separation involves possessions which they had shared . they both angrily believe they should have what they want . she asks for some possession and he denies her the right to it . she replies that she gave him money for a possession which he has and therefore should have what she wants now . he replies that she has forgotten that for the number of years they lived together he never charged her rent and if he had she would now owe him $ 7,000 . she is appalled that he equates their history with a sum of money . she is even more furious to realize that this sum of money represents the entire rent on the apartment and implies that he should not have paid anything at all . she is furious . she kills him mentally . once and for all she decides she is well rid of this man and that she should n't feel sad at their parting . she decides to prove to herself that she 's glad he 's gone from her life . with joy she will dance on all the bad memories of their life together . for my motorcycle betrayer @97@
