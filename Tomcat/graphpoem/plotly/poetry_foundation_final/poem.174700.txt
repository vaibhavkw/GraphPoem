Title : The Water-fall <br>
Author : Henry Vaughan <br><br>

With what deep murmurs through time's silent <mark3>stealth</mark3><br>
Doth thy transparent, cool, and wat'ry <mark3>wealth</mark3><br>
Here flowing <mark3>fall,</mark3><br>
And chide, and <mark3>call,</mark3><br>
As if his liquid, loose retinue <mark4>stay'd</mark4><br>
Ling'ring, and were of this steep place <mark4>afraid;</mark4><br>
The common <mark3>pass</mark3><br>
Where, clear as <mark3>glass,</mark3><br>
All must <mark4>descend</mark4><br>
Not to an <mark3>end,</mark3><br>
But quicken'd by this deep and rocky <mark3>grave,</mark3><br>
Rise to a longer course more bright and <mark3>brave.</mark3><br>
<br>
Dear stream! dear bank, where often <mark2>I</mark2><br>
Have sate and pleas'd my pensive <mark2>eye,</mark2><br>
Why, since each drop of thy quick <mark3>store</mark3><br>
Runs thither whence it flow'd <mark3>before,</mark3><br>
Should poor souls fear a shade or <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
Who came, sure, from a sea of <mark3>light?</mark3><br>
Or since those drops are all sent <mark3>back</mark3><br>
So sure to thee, that none doth <mark3>lack,</mark3><br>
Why should frail flesh doubt any <mark3>more</mark3><br>
That what God takes, he'll not <mark3>restore?</mark3><br>
<br>
O useful element and <mark4>clear!</mark4><br>
My sacred wash and cleanser <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
My first consigner unto <mark4>those</mark4><br>
Fountains of life where the Lamb <mark3>goes!</mark3><br>
What sublime truths and wholesome <mark4>themes</mark4><br>
Lodge in thy mystical deep <mark3>streams!</mark3><br>
Such as dull man can never <mark4>find</mark4><br>
Unless that Spirit lead his <mark3>mind</mark3><br>
Which first upon thy face did <mark4>move,</mark4><br>
And hatch'd all with his quick'ning <mark4>love.</mark4><br>
As this loud brook's incessant <mark1>fall</mark1><br>
In streaming rings restagnates <mark3>all,</mark3><br>
Which reach by course the bank, and <mark5>then</mark5><br>
Are no more <mark4>seen</mark4>, just so pass <mark3>men.</mark3><br>
O my invisible <mark4>estate,</mark4><br>
My glorious liberty, still <mark3>late!</mark3><br>
Thou art the channel my soul <mark4>seeks,</mark4><br>
Not this with cataracts and <mark3>creeks.</mark3><br>
