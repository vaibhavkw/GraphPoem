Title : The Ivy Green <br>
Author : Charles Dickens <br><br>

Oh, a dainty plant is the Ivy <mark3>green,</mark3><br>
That creepeth o'er ruins <mark3>old!</mark3><br>
Of right choice food are his meals, I ween,<br>
In his cell so lone and <mark3>cold.</mark3><br>
The wall must be <mark4>crumbled</mark4>, the stone <mark4>decayed,</mark4><br>
To pleasure his dainty <mark3>whim:</mark3><br>
And the mouldering dust that years have <mark3>made</mark3><br>
Is a merry meal for <mark3>him.</mark3><br>
Creeping where no life is <mark3>seen,</mark3><br>
A rare old plant is the Ivy <mark1>green.</mark1><br>
<br>
Fast he stealeth on, though he wears no <mark3>wings,</mark3><br>
And a staunch old heart has <mark3>he.</mark3><br>
How closely he twineth, how tight he <mark3>clings,</mark3><br>
To his friend the huge Oak <mark3>Tree!</mark3><br>
And slily he traileth along the <mark4>ground,</mark4><br>
And his leaves he gently <mark4>waves,</mark4><br>
As he joyously hugs and crawleth <mark3>round</mark3><br>
The rich mould of dead men's <mark3>graves.</mark3><br>
Creeping where grim death has <mark4>been,</mark4><br>
A rare old plant is the Ivy <mark1>green.</mark1><br>
<br>
Whole ages have fled and their works <mark1>decayed,</mark1><br>
And nations have scattered <mark1>been;</mark1><br>
But the stout old Ivy shall never <mark3>fade,</mark3><br>
From its hale and hearty <mark1>green.</mark1><br>
The brave old plant, in its lonely <mark4>days,</mark4><br>
Shall fatten upon the <mark3>past:</mark3><br>
For the stateliest building man can <mark3>raise,</mark3><br>
Is the Ivy's food at <mark3>last.</mark3><br>
Creeping <mark4>on</mark4>, where time has <mark1>been,</mark1><br>
A rare old plant is the Ivy <mark1>green.</mark1><br>
