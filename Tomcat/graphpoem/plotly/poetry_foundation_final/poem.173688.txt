Title : My Last Dance <br>
Author : Julia Ward Howe <br><br>

The shell of objects inwardly <mark4>consumed</mark4><br>
Will stand, till some convulsive wind awakes;<br>
Such sense hath Fire to waste the heart of <mark3>things,</mark3><br>
Nature, such love to hold the form she <mark4>makes.</mark4><br>
<br>
Thus, wasted joys will show their early bloom,<br>
Yet crumble at the breath of a <mark4>caress;</mark4><br>
The golden fruitage hides the scathed <mark3>bough,</mark3><br>
Snatch it, thou scatterest wide its <mark4>emptiness.</mark4><br>
<br>
For pleasure bidden, I went forth last <mark3>night</mark3><br>
To where, thick hung, the festal torches <mark4>gleamed;</mark4><br>
Here were the flowers, the music, as of <mark4>old,</mark4><br>
Almost the very olden time it <mark4>seemed.</mark4><br>
<br>
For one with cheek unfaded, (though he <mark3>brings</mark3><br>
My buried brothers to me, in his <mark3>look,)</mark3><br>
Said, Will you dance?' At the accustomed <mark4>words</mark4><br>
I gave my hand, the old position <mark3>took.</mark3><br>
<br>
Sound, gladsome measure! at whose bidding <mark4>once</mark4><br>
I felt the flush of pleasure to my <mark3>brow,</mark3><br>
While my soul shook the burthen of the flesh,<br>
And in its young pride said, Lie lightly <mark3>thou!'</mark3><br>
<br>
Then, like a gallant swimmer, flinging high<br>
My breast against the golden waves of <mark4>sound,</mark4><br>
I rode the madd'ning tumult of the <mark4>dance,</mark4><br>
Mocking fatigue, that never could be <mark3>found.</mark3><br>
<br>
Chide not,?it was not vanity, nor <mark4>sense,</mark4><br>
(The brutish scorn such vaporous <mark3>delight,)</mark3><br>
But Nature, cadencing her joy of strength<br>
To the harmonious limits of her <mark3>right.</mark3><br>
<br>
She gave her impulse to the dancing <mark4>Hours,</mark4><br>
To winds that sweep, to stars that noiseless <mark3>turn;</mark3><br>
She marked the measure rapid hearts must keep<br>
Devised each pace that glancing feet should <mark3>learn.</mark3><br>
<br>
And sure, that prodigal o'erflow of life,<br>
Unvow'd as yet to family or <mark4>state,</mark4><br>
Sweet sounds, white garments, flowery coronals<br>
Make holy, in the pageant of our <mark3>fate.</mark3><br>
<br>
Sound, measure! but to stir my heart no more?<br>
For, as I moved to join the dizzy <mark4>race,</mark4><br>
My youth fell from me; all its blooms were <mark4>gone,</mark4><br>
And others showed them, smiling, in my <mark3>face.</mark3><br>
<br>
Faintly I met the shock of circling <mark4>forms</mark4><br>
Linked each to other, Fashion's <mark4>galley-slaves,</mark4><br>
Dream-wondering, like an unaccustomed <mark4>ghost</mark4><br>
That starts, surprised, to stumble over <mark3>graves.</mark3><br>
<br>
For graves were 'neath my feet, whose placid <mark4>masks</mark4><br>
Smiled out upon my folly mournfully,<br>
While all the host of the departed <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
Tread lightly?thou art ashes, even as we.'<br>
