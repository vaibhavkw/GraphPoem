An axe <mark4>angles</mark4><br>
                               from my neighbor's ashcan; <br>
It is hell's <mark4>handiwork,</mark4><br>
the wood not <mark4>hickory,</mark4><br>
The flow of the <mark1>grain</mark1><br>
not faithfully <mark4>followed.</mark4><br>
The shivered <mark5>shaft</mark5><br>
                                       rises from a shellheap <br>
Of plastic <mark4>playthings,</mark4><br>
paper <mark5>plates,</mark5><br>
And the sheer <mark4>shards</mark4><br>
of shattered <mark4>tumblers</mark4><br>
That were not annealed <br>
                                             for the time needful. <br>
At the same <mark4>curbside,</mark4><br>
a cast-off <mark4>cabinet</mark4><br>
Of wavily <mark4>warped</mark4><br>
unseasoned <mark4>wood</mark4><br>
Waits to be <mark4>trundled</mark4><br>
in the trash-man's <mark4>truck.</mark4><br>
Haul them off! Hide <mark1>them!</mark1><br>
                                                 The heart winces <br>
For junk and gimcrack, <br>
for jerrybuilt <mark4>things</mark4><br>
And the men who make <mark1>them</mark1><br>
for a little <mark4>money,</mark4><br>
Bartering <mark4>pride</mark4><br>
like the bought <mark4>boxer</mark4><br>
Who pulls his <mark4>punches,</mark4><br>
or the paid-off <mark4>jockey</mark4><br>
Who in the home stretch <br>
holds in his <mark4>horse.</mark4><br>
Yet the things <mark4>themselves</mark4><br>
in thoughtless <mark4>honor</mark4><br>
Have kept <mark4>composure,</mark4><br>
like captives who would <mark4>not</mark4><br>
Talk under <mark4>torture.</mark4><br>
Tossed from a <mark4>tailgate</mark4><br>
Where the dump <mark4>displays</mark4><br>
                                              its random dolmens, <br>
Its black <mark4>barrows</mark4><br>
and blazing <mark4>valleys,</mark4><br>
They shall waste in the <mark4>weather</mark4><br>
                                                          toward what they were. <br>
The sun shall <mark4>glory</mark4><br>
in the glitter of <mark4>glass-chips,</mark4><br>
Foreseeing the salvage <br>
of the prisoned <mark4>sand,</mark4><br>
And the blistering <mark4>paint</mark4><br>
peel off in <mark4>patches,</mark4><br>
That the good <mark1>grain</mark1><br>
be discovered <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
Then burnt, <mark4>bulldozed,</mark4><br>
they shall all be <mark4>buried</mark4><br>
To the depth of <mark4>diamonds,</mark4><br>
in the making <mark4>dark</mark4><br>
Where halt Hephaestus <br>
keeps his <mark4>hammer</mark4><br>
And Wayland's <mark4>work</mark4><br>
                                       is worn away.<br>
