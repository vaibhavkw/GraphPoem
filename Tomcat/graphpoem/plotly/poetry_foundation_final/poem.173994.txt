Title : Spring <br>
Author : Edna St. Vincent Millay <br><br>

To what purpose, April, do you return <mark3>again?</mark3><br>
Beauty is not <mark4>enough.</mark4><br>
You can no longer quiet me with the <mark4>redness</mark4><br>
Of little leaves opening stickily.<br>
I know what I know.<br>
The sun is hot on my neck as I observe<br>
The spikes of the <mark4>crocus.</mark4><br>
The smell of the earth is good.<br>
It is apparent that there is no death.<br>
But what does that signify?<br>
Not only under ground are the brains of <mark3>men</mark3><br>
Eaten by <mark4>maggots.</mark4><br>
Life in <mark4>itself</mark4><br>
Is nothing,<br>
An empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted <mark4>stairs.</mark4><br>
It is not enough that yearly, down this hill,<br>
<br>
Comes like an idiot, babbling and strewing <mark4>flowers.</mark4><br>
