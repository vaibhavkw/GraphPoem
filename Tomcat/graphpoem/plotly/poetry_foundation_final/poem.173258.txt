Title : An Ode on the Popular Superstitions of the Highlands of Scotland, Considered as the Subject of Poetry <br>
Author : William Collins <br><br>

Home, thou return'st from Thames, whose Naiads <mark3>long</mark3><br>
Have seen thee ling'ring, with a fond <mark3>delay,</mark3><br>
Mid those soft friends, whose hearts, some future <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
Shall melt, perhaps, to hear thy tragic <mark3>song.</mark3><br>
Go, not unmindful of that cordial <mark3>youth,</mark3><br>
Whom, long endear'd, thou leav'st by Lavant's <mark3>side;</mark3><br>
Together let us wish him lasting <mark3>truth,</mark3><br>
And joy untainted with his destined <mark3>bride.</mark3><br>
Go! nor regardless, while these numbers <mark3>boast</mark3><br>
My short-lived bliss, forget my social <mark3>name;</mark3><br>
But think far off how, on the southern <mark3>coast,</mark3><br>
I met thy friendship with an equal <mark3>flame!</mark3><br>
Fresh to that soil thou turn'st, whose ev'ry <mark3>vale</mark3><br>
Shall prompt the poet, and his song <mark4>demand:</mark4><br>
To thee thy copious subjects ne'er shall <mark3>fail;</mark3><br>
Thou need'st but take the pencil to thy <mark3>hand,</mark3><br>
And paint what all believe who own thy genial <mark3>land.</mark3><br>
<br>
There must thou wake perforce thy Doric <mark4>quill,</mark4><br>
'Tis Fancy's land to which thou sett'st thy <mark4>feet;</mark4><br>
Where still, 'tis said, the fairy people <mark3>meet</mark3><br>
Beneath each birken shade, on mead or <mark3>hill.</mark3><br>
There each trim lass that skims the milky <mark3>store</mark3><br>
To the swart tribes their creamy bowl <mark4>allots;</mark4><br>
By night they sip it round the <mark3>cottage-door,</mark3><br>
While airy minstrels warble jocund <mark4>notes.</mark4><br>
There ev'ry herd, by sad experience, <mark3>knows</mark3><br>
How, winged with fate, their elf-shot arrows <mark3>fly,</mark3><br>
When the sick ewe her summer food <mark3>forgoes,</mark3><br>
Or, stretched on earth, the heart-smit heifers <mark3>lie.</mark3><br>
Such airy beings awe th' untutored <mark3>swain:</mark3><br>
Nor thou, though learned, his homelier thoughts <mark4>neglect;</mark4><br>
Let thy sweet muse the rural faith <mark3>sustain;</mark3><br>
These are the themes of simple, sure <mark3>effect,</mark3><br>
That add new conquests to her boundless <mark3>reign.</mark3><br>
And fill with double force her heart-commanding <mark3>strain.</mark3><br>
<br>
Ev'n yet preserv'd, how often may'st thou <mark4>hear,</mark4><br>
Where to the pole the Boreal mountains <mark4>run,</mark4><br>
Taught by the father to his list'ning <mark3>son</mark3><br>
Strange lays, whose pow'r had charmed a Spenser's <mark3>ear.</mark3><br>
At ev'ry pause, before thy mind <mark4>possessed,</mark4><br>
Old Runic bards shall seem to rise <mark4>around,</mark4><br>
With uncouth lyres, in many-coloured <mark3>vest,</mark3><br>
Their matted hair with boughs fantastic <mark3>crowned:</mark3><br>
Whether thou bidd'st the well-taught hind <mark4>repeat</mark4><br>
The choral dirge that mourns some chieftain <mark3>brave,</mark3><br>
When ev'ry shrieking maid her bosom <mark3>beat,</mark3><br>
And strewed with choicest herbs his scented <mark3>grave;</mark3><br>
Or whether, sitting in the shepherd's <mark4>shiel,</mark4><br>
Thou hear'st some sounding tale of war's <mark4>alarms;</mark4><br>
When, at the bugle's <mark4>call</mark4>, with fire and <mark3>steel,</mark3><br>
The sturdy clans pour'd forth their bonny <mark4>swarms,</mark4><br>
And hostile brothers met to prove each other's <mark4>arms.</mark4><br>
<br>
'Tis thine to sing how, framing hideous <mark4>spells,</mark4><br>
In Skye's lone isle the gifted wizard <mark3>seer,</mark3><br>
Lodged in the wintry cave with [          <mark4>]</mark4><br>
Or in the depth of Uist's dark forest <mark3>dwells:</mark3><br>
How they, whose sight such dreary dreams <mark4>engross,</mark4><br>
With their own visions oft astonished <mark3>droop,</mark3><br>
When o'er the wat'ry strath or quaggy <mark4>moss</mark4><br>
They see the gliding ghosts unbodied <mark3>troop.</mark3><br>
Or if in sports, or on the festive <mark4>green,</mark4><br>
Their [      ] glance some fated youth <mark5>descry,</mark5><br>
Who, now perhaps in lusty vigour <mark3>seen</mark3><br>
And rosy health, shall soon lamented <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
For them the viewless forms of air <mark3>obey,</mark3><br>
Their bidding heed, and at their beck <mark4>repair.</mark4><br>
They know what spirit brews the stormful <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
And heartless, oft like moody madness <mark3>stare</mark3><br>
To see the phantom train their secret work <mark3>prepare.</mark3><br>
<br>
[Stanza 5 and the first eight lines of stanza 6 are <mark4>missing]</mark4><br>
<br>
What though far off, from some dark dell espied, <br>
His glimm'ring mazes cheer th' excursive <mark4>sight,</mark4><br>
Yet turn, ye wand'rers, turn your steps <mark4>aside,</mark4><br>
Nor trust the guidance of that faithless <mark3>light!</mark3><br>
For watchful, lurking mid th' unrustling <mark4>reed,</mark4><br>
At those mirk hours the wily monster <mark4>lies,</mark4><br>
And listens oft to hear the passing <mark3>steed,</mark3><br>
And frequent round him rolls his sullen <mark3>eyes,</mark3><br>
If chance his savage wrath may some weak wretch <mark3>surprise.</mark3><br>
<br>
Ah, luckless swain, o'er all unblest <mark3>indeed!</mark3><br>
Whom late bewildered in the dank, dark <mark4>fen,</mark4><br>
Far from his flocks and smoking hamlet <mark3>then!</mark3><br>
To that sad spot [            <mark4>]:</mark4><br>
On him, enraged, the <mark4>fiend</mark4>, in angry <mark4>mood,</mark4><br>
Shall never look with pity's kind <mark4>concern,</mark4><br>
But instant, furious, raise the whelming <mark4>flood</mark4><br>
O'er its drowned banks, forbidding all <mark3>return.</mark3><br>
Or, if he meditate his wished <mark4>escape</mark4><br>
To some dim hill that seems uprising <mark4>near,</mark4><br>
To his faint eye the grim and grisly <mark3>shape,</mark3><br>
In all its terrors clad, shall wild <mark3>appear.</mark3><br>
Meantime, the wat'ry surge shall round him <mark3>rise,</mark3><br>
Poured sudden forth from ev'ry swelling <mark4>source.</mark4><br>
What now remains but tears and hopeless <mark3>sighs?</mark3><br>
His fear-shook limbs have lost their youthly <mark3>force,</mark3><br>
And down the waves he <mark4>floats</mark4>, a pale and breathless <mark3>corse.</mark3><br>
<br>
For him in vain his anxious wife shall <mark4>wait,</mark4><br>
Or wander forth to meet him on his <mark3>way;</mark3><br>
For him in vain, at to-fall of the <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
His bairns shall linger at th' unclosing <mark3>gate.</mark3><br>
Ah, ne'er shall he return! Alone, if <mark4>night</mark4><br>
Her travell'd limbs in broken slumbers <mark4>steep,</mark4><br>
With drooping willows <mark4>dressed</mark4>, his mournful <mark3>sprite</mark3><br>
Shall visit sad, perhaps, her silent <mark3>sleep:</mark3><br>
Then he, perhaps, with moist and watry <mark1>hand,</mark1><br>
Shall fondly seem to press her shudd'ring <mark3>cheek,</mark3><br>
And with his blue swoll'n face before her <mark3>stand,</mark3><br>
And, shiv'ring cold, these piteous accents <mark3>speak:</mark3><br>
'Pursue, dear wife, thy daily toils <mark3>pursue</mark3><br>
At dawn or dusk, industrious as <mark4>before;</mark4><br>
Nor e'er of me one hapless thought <mark3>renew,</mark3><br>
While I lie welt'ring on the osiered <mark3>shore,</mark3><br>
Drown'd by the kaelpie's wrath, nor e'er shall aid thee <mark3>more!'</mark3><br>
<br>
Unbounded is thy range; with varied <mark4>style</mark4><br>
Thy Muse may, like those feath'ry tribes which <mark4>spring</mark4><br>
From their rude rocks, extend her skirting <mark3>wing</mark3><br>
Round the moist marge of each cold Hebrid <mark3>isle,</mark3><br>
To that hoar pile which still its ruin <mark4>shows:</mark4><br>
In whose small vaults a pigmy-folk is <mark4>found,</mark4><br>
Whose bones the delver with his spade upthrows, <br>
And culls them, wond'ring, from the hallowed <mark3>ground!</mark3><br>
Or thither, where beneath the show'ry <mark4>west</mark4><br>
The mighty kings of three fair realms are <mark4>laid;</mark4><br>
Once foes, perhaps, together now they <mark3>rest.</mark3><br>
No slaves revere them, and no wars <mark3>invade:</mark3><br>
Yet frequent now, at midnight's solemn <mark4>hour,</mark4><br>
The rifted mounds their yawning cells <mark4>unfold,</mark4><br>
And forth the monarchs stalk with sov'reign <mark4>pow'r,</mark4><br>
In pageant robes, and wreathed with sheeny <mark3>gold,</mark3><br>
And on their twilight tombs aerial council <mark3>hold.</mark3><br>
<br>
But, O! o'er all, forget not Kilda's <mark4>race,</mark4><br>
On whose bleak rocks, which brave the wasting <mark4>tides,</mark4><br>
Fair Nature's daughter, Virtue, yet <mark3>abides!</mark3><br>
Go, just as they, their blameless manners <mark3>trace!</mark3><br>
Then to my ear transmit some gentle <mark1>song,</mark1><br>
Of those whose lives are yet sincere and <mark4>plain,</mark4><br>
Their bounded walks the rugged cliffs <mark3>along,</mark3><br>
And all their prospect but the wintry <mark3>main.</mark3><br>
With sparing temp'rance, at the needful <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
They drain the sainted spring, or, <mark3>hunger-pressed,</mark3><br>
Along th' Atlantic rock undreading <mark3>climb,</mark3><br>
And of its eggs despoil the solan's <mark3>nest.</mark3><br>
Thus blest in primal innocence they <mark4>live,</mark4><br>
Sufficed and happy with that frugal <mark4>fare</mark4><br>
Which tasteful toil and hourly danger <mark3>give.</mark3><br>
Hard is their shallow soil, [      ] and <mark3>bare;</mark3><br>
Nor ever vernal bee was heard to murmur <mark3>there!</mark3><br>
<br>
Nor need'st thou blush, that such false themes <mark5>engage</mark5><br>
Thy gentle mind, of fairer stores <mark1>possessed;</mark1><br>
For not alone they touch the village <mark3>breast,</mark3><br>
But filled in elder time th' historic <mark3>page.</mark3><br>
There Shakespeare's self, with ev'ry garland <mark1>crowned,</mark1><br>
In musing hour, his Wayward Sisters <mark1>found,</mark1><br>
And with their terrors dressed the magic <mark4>scene.</mark4><br>
From them he sung, when mid his bold <mark4>design,</mark4><br>
Before the Scot afflicted and <mark4>aghast,</mark4><br>
The shadowy kings of Banquo's fated <mark3>line</mark3><br>
Through the dark cave in gleamy pageant <mark3>passed.</mark3><br>
Proceed, nor quit the tales which, simply <mark4>told,</mark4><br>
Could once so well my answ'ring bosom <mark4>pierce;</mark4><br>
<mark4>Proceed</mark4>, in forceful sounds and colours <mark3>bold</mark3><br>
The native legends of thy land <mark4>rehearse;</mark4><br>
To such adapt thy lyre and suit thy pow'rful <mark3>verse.</mark3><br>
In scenes like these, which, daring to <mark4>depart</mark4><br>
From sober truth, are still to nature <mark3>true,</mark3><br>
And call forth fresh delight to Fancy's <mark3>view,</mark3><br>
Th' heroic Muse employed her Tasso's <mark3>art!</mark3><br>
How have I trembled when, at Tancred's <mark4>stroke,</mark4><br>
Its gushing blood the gaping cypress <mark4>poured;</mark4><br>
When each live plant with mortal accents <mark3>spoke,</mark3><br>
And the wild blast up-heaved the vanished <mark3>sword!</mark3><br>
How have I sat, where piped the pensive <mark4>wind,</mark4><br>
To hear his harp, by British Fairfax <mark4>strung,</mark4><br>
Prevailing poet, whose undoubting <mark3>mind</mark3><br>
Believed the magic wonders which he <mark3>sung!</mark3><br>
Hence at each sound imagination <mark4>glows;</mark4><br>
Hence his warm lay with softest sweetness <mark3>flows;</mark3><br>
Melting it flows, pure, num'rous, strong, and <mark4>clear,</mark4><br>
And fills th' impassioned heart, and lulls th' harmonious <mark1>ear.</mark1><br>
<br>
All <mark3>hail</mark3>, ye scenes that o'er my soul <mark4>prevail,</mark4><br>
Ye [       ] friths and lakes which, far <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
Are by smooth Annan filled or past'ral <mark3>Tay,</mark3><br>
Or Don's romantic springs, at distance, <mark3>hail!</mark3><br>
The time shall come when I, perhaps, may <mark4>tread</mark4><br>
Your lowly glens, o'erhung with spreading <mark4>broom,</mark4><br>
Or, o'er your stretching heaths by Fancy <mark3>led:</mark3><br>
Then will I dress once more the faded <mark3>bow'r,</mark3><br>
Where Jonson sat in Drummond's [      ] <mark4>shade;</mark4><br>
Or crop from Tiviot's dale each [       ] <br>
And mourn on Yarrow's banks [       <mark4>]</mark4><br>
Meantime, ye pow'rs, that on the plains which <mark4>bore</mark4><br>
The cordial youth, on Lothian's plains <mark4>attend,</mark4><br>
Where'er he dwell, on hill or lowly <mark4>muir,</mark4><br>
To him I lose, your kind protection <mark3>lend,</mark3><br>
And, touched with love like mine, preserve my absent <mark3>friend</mark3><br>
