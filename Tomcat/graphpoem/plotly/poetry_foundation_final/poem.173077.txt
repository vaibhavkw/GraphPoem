Title : Care for Thy Soul as Thing of Greatest Price <br>
Author : William Byrd <br><br>

Care for thy soul as thing of greatest <mark3>price,</mark3><br>
Made to the end to taste of power <mark3>divine,</mark3><br>
Devoid of guilt, abhorring sin and <mark3>vice,</mark3><br>
Apt by God's grace to virtue to <mark3>incline.</mark3><br>
Care for it so as by thy retchless <mark4>train</mark4><br>
It be not brought to taste eternal <mark3>pain.</mark3><br>
<br>
Care for thy corse, but chiefly for soul's <mark3>sake;</mark3><br>
Cut off excess, sustaining food is <mark3>best;</mark3><br>
To vanquish pride but comely clothing <mark3>take;</mark3><br>
Seek after skill, deep ignorance <mark3>detest.</mark3><br>
Care so, I say, the flesh to feed and clothe <br>
That thou harm not thy soul and body both. <br>
<br>
Care for the world to do thy body <mark4>right;</mark4><br>
Rack not thy wit to win thy wicked <mark3>ways;</mark3><br>
Seek not to oppress the weak by wrongful <mark3>might;</mark3><br>
To pay thy due do banish all <mark3>delays.</mark3><br>
Care to dispend according to thy <mark4>store,</mark4><br>
And in like sort be mindful of the <mark4>poor.</mark4><br>
<br>
Care for thy soul, as for thy chiefest stay; <br>
Care for thy body for thy soul's <mark3>avail;</mark3><br>
Care for the world for body's help alway; <br>
Care yet but so as virtue may <mark3>prevail.</mark3><br>
Care in such sort that thou be sure of <mark4>this:</mark4><br>
Care keep thee not from heaven and heavenly <mark3>bliss.</mark3><br>
