Title : On a Girdle <br>
Author : Edmund Waller <br><br>

That which her slender waist confin'd,<br>
Shall now my joyful temples <mark4>bind;</mark4><br>
No monarch but would give his <mark4>crown,</mark4><br>
His arms might do what this has <mark4>done.</mark4><br>
<br>
It was my heaven's extremest <mark3>sphere,</mark3><br>
The pale which held that lovely <mark3>deer,</mark3><br>
My joy, my grief, my hope, my <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
Did all within this circle <mark4>move.</mark4><br>
<br>
A narrow compass, and yet <mark4>there</mark4><br>
Dwelt all that's good, and all that's <mark3>fair;</mark3><br>
Give me but what this ribbon <mark4>bound,</mark4><br>
Take all the rest the sun goes <mark3>round.</mark3><br>
