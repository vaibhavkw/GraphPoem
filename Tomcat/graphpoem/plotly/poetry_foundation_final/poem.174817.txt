Title : September, 1819 <br>
Author : William Wordsworth <br><br>

Departing summer hath <mark4>assumed</mark4><br>
An aspect tenderly illumed,<br>
The gentlest look of <mark4>spring;</mark4><br>
That calls from yonder leafy <mark4>shade</mark4><br>
Unfaded, yet prepared to <mark3>fade,</mark3><br>
A timely carolling.<br>
<br>
No faint and hesitating <mark3>trill,</mark3><br>
Such tribute as to winter <mark3>chill</mark3><br>
The lonely redbreast <mark3>pays!</mark3><br>
Clear, loud, and lively is the <mark3>din,</mark3><br>
From social warblers gathering <mark3>in</mark3><br>
Their harvest of sweet <mark3>lays.</mark3><br>
<br>
Nor doth the example fail to <mark3>cheer</mark3><br>
Me, conscious that my leaf is <mark3>sere,</mark3><br>
And yellow on the <mark3>bough:--</mark3><br>
Fall, rosy garlands, from my <mark4>head!</mark4><br>
Ye myrtle wreaths, your fragrance <mark3>shed</mark3><br>
Around a younger <mark3>brow!</mark3><br>
<br>
Yet will I temperately <mark3>rejoice;</mark3><br>
Wide is the range, and free the <mark3>choice</mark3><br>
Of undiscordant <mark4>themes;</mark4><br>
Which, haply, kindred souls may <mark4>prize</mark4><br>
Not less than vernal ecstasies,<br>
And passion's feverish <mark4>dreams.</mark4><br>
<br>
For deathless powers to verse <mark4>belong,</mark4><br>
And they like Demi-gods are <mark3>strong</mark3><br>
On whom the Muses <mark4>smile;</mark4><br>
But some their function have <mark4>disclaimed,</mark4><br>
Best pleased with what is aptliest <mark3>framed</mark3><br>
To enervate and defile.<br>
<br>
Not such the initiatory <mark4>strains</mark4><br>
Committed to the silent <mark3>plains</mark3><br>
In Britain's earliest <mark4>dawn:</mark4><br>
Trembled the groves, the stars grew <mark4>pale,</mark4><br>
While all-too-daringly the <mark3>veil</mark3><br>
Of nature was <mark3>withdrawn!</mark3><br>
<br>
Nor such the spirit-stirring <mark4>note</mark4><br>
When the live chords Alcaeus smote,<br>
Inflamed by sense of <mark3>wrong;</mark3><br>
Woe! woe to Tyrants! from the <mark4>lyre</mark4><br>
Broke threateningly, in sparkles <mark3>dire</mark3><br>
Of fierce vindictive <mark3>song.</mark3><br>
<br>
And not unhallowed was the <mark3>page</mark3><br>
By winged Love inscribed, to <mark3>assuage</mark3><br>
The pangs of vain <mark4>pursuit;</mark4><br>
Love listening while the Lesbian <mark4>Maid</mark4><br>
With finest touch of passion <mark3>swayed</mark3><br>
Her own AEolian <mark3>lute.</mark3><br>
<br>
O ye, who patiently <mark4>explore</mark4><br>
The wreck of Herculanean <mark3>lore,</mark3><br>
What rapture! could ye <mark4>seize</mark4><br>
Some Theban fragment, or <mark4>unroll</mark4><br>
One precious, tender-hearted <mark3>scroll</mark3><br>
Of pure Simonides.<br>
<br>
That were, indeed, a genuine <mark4>birth</mark4><br>
Of poesy; a bursting <mark4>forth</mark4><br>
Of genius from the <mark4>dust:</mark4><br>
What Horace gloried to <mark4>behold,</mark4><br>
What Maro <mark4>loved</mark4>, shall we <mark3>enfold?</mark3><br>
Can haughty Time be <mark3>just!</mark3><br>
