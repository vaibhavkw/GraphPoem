Title : O Captain! My Captain! <br>
Author : Walt Whitman <br><br>

O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is <mark3>done,</mark3><br>
The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is <mark3>won,</mark3><br>
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all <mark4>exulting,</mark4><br>
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and <mark4>daring;</mark4><br>
But O heart! heart! <mark5>heart!</mark5><br>
O the bleeding drops of <mark3>red,</mark3><br>
Where on the deck my Captain <mark4>lies,</mark4><br>
Fallen cold and <mark3>dead.</mark3><br>
<br>
O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the <mark4>bells;</mark4><br>
Rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills, <br>
For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths--for you the shores <mark4>a-crowding,</mark4><br>
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces <mark4>turning;</mark4><br>
                         Here Captain! dear father! <br>
This arm beneath your <mark3>head!</mark3><br>
                               It is some dream that on the deck, <br>
You've fallen cold and <mark1>dead.</mark1><br>
<br>
My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and <mark3>still,</mark3><br>
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor <mark3>will,</mark3><br>
The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and <mark1>done,</mark1><br>
From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object <mark1>won;</mark1><br>
Exult O <mark4>shores</mark4>, and ring O <mark1>bells!</mark1><br>
But I with mournful <mark3>tread,</mark3><br>
Walk the deck my Captain <mark1>lies,</mark1><br>
Fallen cold and <mark1>dead.</mark1><br>
