Title : Stranger at the Ashwood Threshold <br>
Author : Sherod Santos <br><br>

<br>
Did he think that disguise would fool me? Gathering <mark4>about</mark4><br>
His balding head those filthy rags, <mark4>poor-mouthing</mark4><br>
His way beside my fire, then gazing into the looking <mark4>glass</mark4><br>
Of my bride's-mind to summon up the <mark4>legend</mark4><br>
I'd seen last at the ashwood threshold twenty years ago,   <br>
The husband who'd upped and sailed away on a <mark4>black,</mark4><br>
Oar-swept ship of war to a place he called. . . I call Destroy. <br>
"Your son will vouch for me," he claimed, "I saw your <mark4>king</mark4><br>
<br>
On foreign soil. He wore a wine-dark, woolen <mark1>cape</mark1><br>
Fastened by a brooch inlaid with gold, a brooch on <mark1>which</mark1><br>
A great hound clenched and throttled to death a dappled <mark4>fawn."</mark4><br>
He knew, of course, I'd given Odysseus that very <mark1>cape,</mark1><br>
Had dyed its wool that royal red, had buckled its <mark4>folds</mark4><br>
With that same brooch. And so, I suppose, I passed his <mark4>test.</mark4><br>
The salt tears soaked my cheek. A fact he took in <mark4>silently</mark4><br>
<br>
Beneath his rags, though how could I not have recognized <mark1>him</mark1><br>
With his poet's words, his poet's unfazed <mark4>self-concern</mark4><br>
So skillfully playing my emotions? The truth <mark4>is,</mark4><br>
However much I loved that man in the wine-dark <mark1>cape,</mark1><br>
However much I'd longed for him, I'd have <mark4>settled</mark4><br>
For the man with thinning hair, the beggar-king of Ithaca. <br>
Having slept alone year after year in the upper <mark4>story</mark4><br>
<br>
Of our high-roofed home, having awakened <mark4>nightly</mark4><br>
<br>
In that <mark4>rooted</mark4>, rightly far-famed bed he'd built by <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
Around the bole of a thickset olive tree, I <mark4>soon</mark4><br>
Discovered there are two known gates through <mark1>which</mark1><br>
All dreams must come to pass. The first is <mark4>made</mark4><br>
Of ivory, cleanly carved, the second of polished <mark4>horn;</mark4><br>
Through ivory our dreams are will-o'-the-wisps, <mark4>scant</mark4><br>
Tracings on the air, through horn they're <mark4>star-signs</mark4><br>
We'd be wise to chart our futures by. It was through <mark1>horn</mark1><br>
<br>
It came that night he questioned me beside the <mark4>fire,</mark4><br>
The contest of twelve axes, one for each month <br>
Of the year I'd lived through twenty times for <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
Housebound to the labor of my hardwood <mark4>loom.</mark4><br>
The thwarted suitors watched agog, he watched them <mark4>watch,</mark4><br>
Though no one saw (how could they?) how the <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
That strung his bow recalled my own hand spooling <mark4>out</mark4><br>
<br>
New wool, that drew on strength enough to <mark4>strike</mark4><br>
An arrow through a dozen axe-helve socket <mark4>rings</mark4><br>
Recalled the heart it took each night to climb <mark4>back</mark4><br>
Into the vaulted tomb of our empty, tree-housed <mark4>bed.</mark4><br>
Waiting at the doorway while I was brushing back my <mark4>hair,</mark4><br>
Odysseus stood and stared across the unraked <mark4>terrace</mark4><br>
Gardens trashed from last night's welcome <mark4>home.</mark4><br>
<br>
One guttering pine-pitch torch still burned, its <mark5>pool</mark5><br>
<br>
Of light apotheosized to a ringing lyre--the <mark4>singer's</mark4><br>
Who had begged him calm his bloodlust, <mark3>spare</mark3><br>
One pauper soul among that heavy haul of slaughtered <mark4>men.</mark4><br>
He'd been every inch the hero then, spattered with <mark4>gore,</mark4><br>
His forehead glistening, dripping red. But this <mark4>morning,</mark4><br>
He looked to me just as he had looked before: his <mark4>thin</mark4><br>
Shirt clung like onion skin to his boxer's ropy   <br>
<mark4>Shoulders</mark4>, his young man's muscled chest and <mark4>arms;</mark4><br>
<br>
And as before, those faraway, slightly moonstruck <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
Seemed focused on a flyspeck at the world's <mark4>end.</mark4><br>
It struck me then that, even as he stood there, <mark4>steeped</mark4><br>
In the memory of all this place brought home to <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
He labored at the anchor of whatever in me <br>
Refused that death his heart most longed to <mark4>master.</mark4><br>
And as before, I could see it coming, his going away,   <br>
<br>
Those maddened gulls scavenging after the trim black <mark4>ship</mark4><br>
My harbored longings had driven out of <mark4>reach.</mark4><br>
