Title : from The Bridge: To Brooklyn Bridge <br>
Author : Hart Crane <br><br>

How many dawns, chill from his rippling <mark4>rest</mark4><br>
The seagull's wings shall dip and pivot him, <br>
Shedding white rings of tumult, building <mark3>high</mark3><br>
Over the chained bay waters Liberty-- <br>
<br>
Then, with inviolate curve, forsake our <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
As apparitional as sails that <mark4>cross</mark4><br>
Some page of figures to be filed <mark3>away;</mark3><br>
--Till elevators drop us from our day <mark3>...</mark3><br>
<br>
I think of cinemas, panoramic sleights <br>
With multitudes bent toward some flashing <mark4>scene</mark4><br>
Never disclosed, but hastened to <mark4>again,</mark4><br>
Foretold to other eyes on the same <mark4>screen;</mark4><br>
<br>
And Thee, across the harbor, silver <mark4>paced</mark4><br>
As though the sun took step of thee yet <mark4>left</mark4><br>
Some motion ever unspent in thy <mark4>stride,--</mark4><br>
Implicitly thy freedom staying <mark1>thee!</mark1><br>
<br>
Out of some subway scuttle, cell or <mark4>loft</mark4><br>
A bedlamite speeds to thy parapets, <br>
Tilting there momently, shrill shirt ballooning, <br>
A jest falls from the speechless <mark4>caravan.</mark4><br>
<br>
Down Wall, from girder into street noon <mark4>leaks,</mark4><br>
A rip-tooth of the sky's <mark4>acetylene;</mark4><br>
All afternoon the cloud flown derricks turn <mark4>...</mark4><br>
Thy cables breathe the North Atlantic still. <br>
<br>
And obscure as that heaven of the <mark4>Jews,</mark4><br>
Thy guerdon ... Accolade thou dost <mark3>bestow</mark3><br>
Of anonymity time cannot <mark4>raise:</mark4><br>
Vibrant reprieve and pardon thou dost <mark3>show.</mark3><br>
<br>
O harp and altar, of the fury <mark4>fused,</mark4><br>
(How could mere toil align thy choiring <mark4>strings!</mark4><br>
Terrific threshold of the prophet's pledge, <br>
Prayer of pariah, and the lover's <mark3>cry,</mark3><br>
<br>
Again the traffic lights that skim thy <mark4>swift</mark4><br>
Unfractioned idiom, immaculate sigh of <mark4>stars,</mark4><br>
Beading thy path--condense eternity: <br>
And we have seen night lifted in thine <mark4>arms.</mark4><br>
<br>
Under thy shadow by the piers I <mark4>waited</mark4><br>
Only in darkness is thy shadow <mark3>clear.</mark3><br>
The City's fiery parcels all <mark4>undone,</mark4><br>
Already snow submerges an iron year <mark3>...</mark3><br>
<br>
O Sleepless as the river under <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
Vaulting the sea, the prairies' dreaming <mark4>sod,</mark4><br>
Unto us lowliest sometime sweep, <mark4>descend</mark4><br>
And of the curveship lend a myth to <mark4>God.</mark4><br>
