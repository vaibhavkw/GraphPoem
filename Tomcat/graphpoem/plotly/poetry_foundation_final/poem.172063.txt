Title : Sailing to Byzantium <br>
Author : William Butler Yeats <br><br>

<br>
That is no country for old men. The <mark4>young</mark4><br>
In one another's <mark4>arms</mark4>, birds in the <mark4>trees,</mark4><br>
--Those dying generations--at their <mark4>song,</mark4><br>
The <mark4>salmon-falls</mark4>, the mackerel-crowded <mark3>seas,</mark3><br>
Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer <mark3>long</mark3><br>
Whatever is begotten, born, and <mark4>dies.</mark4><br>
Caught in that sensual music all <mark4>neglect</mark4><br>
Monuments of unageing <mark4>intellect.</mark4><br>
An aged man is but a paltry <mark4>thing,</mark4><br>
<br>
A tattered coat upon a stick, <mark3>unless</mark3><br>
<br>
Soul clap its hands and <mark1>sing</mark1>, and louder <mark3>sing</mark3><br>
For every tatter in its mortal <mark3>dress,</mark3><br>
Nor is there singing school but <mark4>studying</mark4><br>
Monuments of its own magnificence; <br>
And therefore I have sailed the seas and <mark4>come</mark4><br>
To the holy city of <mark4>Byzantium.</mark4><br>
O sages standing in God's holy <mark3>fire</mark3><br>
As in the gold mosaic of a <mark4>wall,</mark4><br>
Come from the holy fire, perne in a gyre, <br>
<br>
And be the singing-masters of my <mark4>soul.</mark4><br>
<br>
Consume my heart away; sick with <mark3>desire</mark3><br>
And fastened to a dying <mark4>animal</mark4><br>
It knows not what it is; and gather me <br>
Into the artifice of eternity. <br>
Once out of nature I shall never <mark3>take</mark3><br>
My bodily form from any natural <mark1>thing,</mark1><br>
But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths <mark3>make</mark3><br>
Of hammered gold and gold enamelling <br>
To keep a drowsy Emperor <mark3>awake;</mark3><br>
<br>
Or set upon a golden bough to <mark1>sing</mark1><br>
<br>
To lords and ladies of <mark1>Byzantium</mark1><br>
Of what is past, or passing, or to <mark1>come.</mark1><br>
