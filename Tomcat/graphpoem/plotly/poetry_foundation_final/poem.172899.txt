Title : The Statesmen <br>
Author : Ambrose Bierce <br><br>

How blest the land that counts <mark3>among</mark3><br>
Her sons so many good and <mark3>wise,</mark3><br>
To execute great feats of <mark3>tongue</mark3><br>
When troubles <mark3>rise.</mark3><br>
<br>
Behold them mounting every <mark3>stump,</mark3><br>
By speech our liberty to <mark3>guard.</mark3><br>
Observe their courage--see them <mark3>jump,</mark3><br>
And come down <mark3>hard!</mark3><br>
<br>
"Walk up, walk up!" each cries <mark4>aloud,</mark4><br>
"And learn from me what you must <mark3>do</mark3><br>
To turn aside the thunder <mark3>cloud,</mark3><br>
The earthquake <mark3>too.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Beware the wiles of yonder <mark3>quack</mark3><br>
Who stuffs the ears of all that <mark3>pass.</mark3><br>
I--I alone can show that <mark3>black</mark3><br>
Is white as <mark3>grass."</mark3><br>
<br>
They shout through all the day and <mark4>break</mark4><br>
The silence of the night as <mark3>well.</mark3><br>
They'd make--I wish they'd go and <mark3>make--</mark3><br>
Of Heaven a <mark3>Hell.</mark3><br>
<br>
A advocates free silver, <mark3>B</mark3><br>
Free trade and C free banking <mark4>laws.</mark4><br>
Free board, clothes, lodging would from <mark3>me</mark3><br>
Win warm <mark3>applause.</mark3><br>
<br>
Lo, D lifts up his voice: "You <mark3>see</mark3><br>
The single tax on land would <mark4>fall</mark4><br>
On all alike." More <mark4>evenly</mark4><br>
No tax at <mark3>all.</mark3><br>
<br>
"With paper money," bellows <mark3>E,</mark3><br>
"We'll all be rich as lords." No <mark3>doubt--</mark3><br>
And richest of the lot will <mark3>be</mark3><br>
The chap <mark3>without.</mark3><br>
<br>
As many "cures" as <mark4>addle-wits</mark4><br>
Who know not what the ailment <mark4>is!</mark4><br>
Meanwhile the patient foams and <mark3>spits</mark3><br>
Like a gin <mark3>fizz.</mark3><br>
<br>
Alas, poor Body <mark4>Politic,</mark4><br>
Your fate is all too clearly <mark4>read:</mark4><br>
To be not altogether <mark4>quick,</mark4><br>
Nor very <mark3>dead.</mark3><br>
<br>
You take your exercise in <mark4>squirms,</mark4><br>
Your rest in fainting fits <mark3>between.</mark3><br>
'Tis plain that your disorder's <mark3>worms--</mark3><br>
Worms fat and <mark3>lean.</mark3><br>
<br>
Worm <mark4>Capital</mark4>, Worm Labor <mark4>dwell</mark4><br>
Within your maw and muscle's <mark4>scope.</mark4><br>
Their quarrels make your life a <mark1>Hell,</mark1><br>
Your death a <mark3>hope.</mark3><br>
<br>
God send you find not such an <mark4>end</mark4><br>
      To ills however sharp and huge! <br>
God send you convalesce! God <mark3>send</mark3><br>
      You vermifuge.<br>
