Author : Lord Byron (George Gordon) <br><br>

On this Day I Complete my Thirty-Sixth <mark4>Year</mark4><br>
'Tis time this heart should be <mark4>unmoved,</mark4><br>
Since others it hath ceased to <mark4>move:</mark4><br>
Yet though I cannot be <mark4>beloved,</mark4><br>
Still let me <mark4>love!</mark4><br>
<br>
My days are in the yellow <mark3>leaf;</mark3><br>
The flowers and fruits of Love are <mark4>gone;</mark4><br>
The worm--the canker, and the <mark3>grief</mark3><br>
Are mine <mark4>alone!</mark4><br>
<br>
The fire that on my bosom <mark3>preys</mark3><br>
Is lone as some Volcanic <mark3>Isle;</mark3><br>
No torch is kindled at its <mark3>blaze</mark3><br>
A funeral <mark3>pile.</mark3><br>
<br>
The hope, the <mark4>fear</mark4>, the jealous <mark4>care,</mark4><br>
The exalted portion of the <mark4>pain</mark4><br>
And power of Love I cannot <mark3>share,</mark3><br>
But wear the <mark3>chain.</mark3><br>
<br>
But 'tis not thus--and 'tis not <mark4>here</mark4><br>
Such thoughts should shake my Soul, nor <mark3>now,</mark3><br>
Where Glory decks the hero's <mark3>bier,</mark3><br>
Or binds his <mark3>brow.</mark3><br>
<br>
The Sword, the Banner, and the <mark4>Field,</mark4><br>
Glory and Greece around us <mark3>see!</mark3><br>
The Spartan borne upon his <mark3>shield</mark3><br>
Was not more <mark3>free.</mark3><br>
<br>
Awake (not Greece--she is <mark3>awake!)</mark3><br>
Awake, my Spirit! Think through <mark4>whom</mark4><br>
Thy life-blood tracks its parent <mark3>lake</mark3><br>
And then strike <mark4>home!</mark4><br>
<br>
Tread those reviving passions <mark4>down</mark4><br>
Unworthy Manhood--unto <mark3>thee</mark3><br>
Indifferent should the smile or <mark3>frown</mark3><br>
Of beauty <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
<br>
If thou regret'st thy Youth, why <mark4>live?</mark4><br>
The land of honourable <mark3>Death</mark3><br>
Is here:--up to the Field, and <mark3>give</mark3><br>
Away thy <mark3>breath!</mark3><br>
<br>
Seek out--less often sought than <mark4>found--</mark4><br>
A Soldier's Grave, for thee the <mark3>best;</mark3><br>
Then look <mark3>around</mark3>, and choose thy <mark3>Ground,</mark3><br>
And take thy <mark3>rest.</mark3><br>
