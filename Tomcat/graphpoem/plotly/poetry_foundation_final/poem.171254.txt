Title : Wasteful Gesture Only Not <br>
Author : Tony Hoagland <br><br>

Ruth visits her mother's grave in the California <mark4>hills.</mark4><br>
She knows her mother isn't there but the rectangle of <mark1>grass</mark1><br>
marks off the place where the memories are <mark4>kept,</mark4><br>
<br>
like a library book named <mark1>Dorothy.</mark1><br>
Some of the chapters might be: <mark1>Dorothy:</mark1><br>
Better Bird-Watcher Than <mark4>Cook;</mark4><br>
<br>
Dorothy, Wife and <mark4>Atheist;</mark4><br>
Passionate Recycler Dorothy, Here Lies But <mark4>Not.</mark4><br>
In the summer hills, where the tall tough <mark1>grass</mark1><br>
<br>
reminds you of <mark4>persistence</mark4><br>
and the endless wind   <br>
reminds you of <mark4>indifference,</mark4><br>
<br>
Ruth brings batches of white <mark4>roses,</mark4><br>
extravagant gesture not entirely wasteful   <br>
because as soon as she is gone she <mark4>knows</mark4><br>
the deer come out of the woods to eat <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
<br>
What was made for the eye <br>
goes into the mouth, <br>
thinks Ruth to herself as she drives away, <br>
and in bed when she tries to remember her mother, <br>
<br>
she drifts instead to the <mark1>roses,</mark1><br>
and when she thinks about the roses she   <br>
sees instead the deer chewing <mark1>them--</mark1><br>
<br>
pale petals of the roses in the <mark4>dark</mark4><br>
warm bellies of the sleeping deer-- <br>
that's what going to sleep is <mark4>like.</mark4><br>
