Title : Patterns <br>
Author : Amy Lowell <br><br>

I walk down the garden <mark4>paths,</mark4><br>
And all the <mark4>daffodils</mark4><br>
Are blowing, and the bright blue <mark1>squills.</mark1><br>
I walk down the patterned garden <mark1>paths</mark1><br>
In my stiff, brocaded <mark4>gown.</mark4><br>
With my powdered hair and jewelled <mark4>fan,</mark4><br>
I too am a <mark4>rare</mark4><br>
<mark4>Pattern</mark4>, As I wander <mark4>down</mark4><br>
The garden <mark1>paths.</mark1><br>
<br>
My dress is richly <mark4>figured,</mark4><br>
And the <mark4>train</mark4><br>
Makes a pink and silver <mark3>stain</mark3><br>
On the gravel, and the <mark4>thrift</mark4><br>
Of the <mark4>borders.</mark4><br>
Just a plate of current <mark4>fashion,</mark4><br>
Tripping by in high-heeled, ribboned <mark4>shoes.</mark4><br>
Not a softness anywhere about <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Only whale-bone and <mark4>brocade.</mark4><br>
And I sink on a seat in the <mark3>shade</mark3><br>
Of a lime tree. For my <mark3>passion</mark3><br>
Wars against the stiff <mark1>brocade.</mark1><br>
The daffodils and <mark1>squills</mark1><br>
Flutter in the <mark4>breeze</mark4><br>
As they <mark3>please.</mark3><br>
And I weep; <br>
For the lime tree is in <mark4>blossom</mark4><br>
And one small flower has dropped upon my <mark4>bosom.</mark4><br>
<br>
And the splashing of <mark5>waterdrops</mark5><br>
In the marble <mark4>fountain</mark4><br>
Comes down the garden <mark1>paths.</mark1><br>
The dripping never <mark4>stops.</mark4><br>
Underneath my stiffened <mark1>gown</mark1><br>
Is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble <mark4>basin,</mark4><br>
A basin in the midst of hedges <mark4>grown</mark4><br>
So thick, she cannot see her lover <mark5>hiding,</mark5><br>
But she guesses he is <mark4>near,</mark4><br>
And the sliding of the <mark5>water</mark5><br>
Seems the stroking of a <mark3>dear</mark3><br>
Hand upon her. <br>
What is Summer in a fine brocaded <mark1>gown!</mark1><br>
I should like to see it lying in a heap upon the <mark4>ground.</mark4><br>
All the pink and silver crumpled up on the <mark1>ground.</mark1><br>
<br>
I would be the pink and silver as I ran along the <mark1>paths,</mark1><br>
And he would stumble <mark4>after,</mark4><br>
Bewildered by my <mark3>laughter.</mark3><br>
I should see the sun flashing from his sword-hilt and the buckles on his <mark1>shoes.</mark1><br>
I would <mark3>choose</mark3><br>
To lead him in a maze along the patterned <mark1>paths,</mark1><br>
A bright and laughing maze for my heavy-booted <mark4>lover,</mark4><br>
Till he caught me in the <mark1>shade,</mark1><br>
And the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he clasped <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Aching, melting, <mark3>unafraid.</mark3><br>
With the shadows of the leaves and the <mark5>sundrops,</mark5><br>
And the plopping of the <mark1>waterdrops,</mark1><br>
All about us in the open <mark4>afternoon</mark4><br>
I am very like to <mark3>swoon</mark3><br>
With the weight of this <mark1>brocade,</mark1><br>
For the sun sifts through the <mark1>shade.</mark1><br>
<br>
Underneath the fallen <mark1>blossom</mark1><br>
In my <mark1>bosom,</mark1><br>
Is a letter I have <mark4>hid.</mark4><br>
It was brought to me this morning by a rider from the <mark4>Duke.</mark4><br>
"Madam, we regret to inform you that Lord Hartwell   <br>
Died in action Thursday <mark4>sen'night."</mark4><br>
As I read it in the <mark4>white</mark4>, morning <mark4>sunlight,</mark4><br>
The letters squirmed like <mark4>snakes.</mark4><br>
"Any answer, Madam," said my <mark4>footman.</mark4><br>
"No," l told <mark4>him.</mark4><br>
"See that the messenger takes some <mark4>refreshment.</mark4><br>
No, no <mark4>answer."</mark4><br>
And I walked into the <mark4>garden,</mark4><br>
Up and down the patterned <mark1>paths,</mark1><br>
In my stiff, correct <mark1>brocade.</mark1><br>
The blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in the <mark4>sun,</mark4><br>
Each <mark3>one.</mark3><br>
I stood upright too, <br>
Held rigid to the <mark4>pattern</mark4><br>
By the stiffness of my <mark1>gown.</mark1><br>
Up and down I <mark4>walked,</mark4><br>
Up and <mark1>down.</mark1><br>
<br>
In a month he would have been my <mark4>husband.</mark4><br>
In a month, here, underneath this <mark4>lime,</mark4><br>
We would have broke the <mark1>pattern;</mark1><br>
He for me, and I for <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
He as Colonel, I as Lady, <br>
On this shady <mark4>seat.</mark4><br>
He had a <mark3>whim</mark3><br>
That sunlight carried <mark4>blessing.</mark4><br>
And I <mark4>answered</mark4>, "It shall be as you have <mark4>said."</mark4><br>
Now he is <mark3>dead.</mark3><br>
<br>
In Summer and in Winter I shall <mark4>walk</mark4><br>
Up and <mark1>down</mark1><br>
The patterned garden <mark1>paths</mark1><br>
In my stiff, brocaded <mark1>gown.</mark1><br>
The squills and <mark1>daffodils</mark1><br>
Will give place to pillared roses, and to asters, and to <mark3>snow.</mark3><br>
I shall <mark3>go</mark3><br>
Up and <mark1>down,</mark1><br>
In my <mark1>gown.</mark1><br>
Gorgeously <mark4>arrayed,</mark4><br>
Boned and <mark3>stayed.</mark3><br>
And the softness of my body will be guarded from <mark4>embrace</mark4><br>
By each button, hook, and <mark3>lace.</mark3><br>
For the man who should loose me is <mark1>dead,</mark1><br>
Fighting with the Duke in <mark4>Flanders,</mark4><br>
In a pattern called a <mark4>war.</mark4><br>
Christ! What are patterns <mark3>for?</mark3><br>
