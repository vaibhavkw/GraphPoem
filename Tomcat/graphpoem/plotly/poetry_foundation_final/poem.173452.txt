Title : To my Dear Friend Mr. Congreve on his Comedy Call'd the Double Dealer <br>
Author : John Dryden <br><br>

Well then; the promis'd hour is come at <mark3>last;</mark3><br>
The present age of wit obscures the <mark3>past:</mark3><br>
Strong were our sires; and as they fought they <mark4>writ,</mark4><br>
Conqu'ring with force of arms, and dint of <mark3>wit;</mark3><br>
Theirs was the giant race, before the <mark4>Flood;</mark4><br>
And thus, when Charles return'd, our empire <mark4>stood.</mark4><br>
Like Janus he the stubborn soil manur'd,<br>
With rules of husbandry the rankness <mark5>cur'd:</mark5><br>
Tam'd us to manners, when the stage was <mark4>rude;</mark4><br>
And boisterous English wit, with art endu'd.<br>
Our age was cultivated thus at <mark3>length;</mark3><br>
But what we gained in skill we lost in <mark3>strength.</mark3><br>
Our builders were, with want of genius, <mark5>curst;</mark5><br>
The second temple was not like the <mark4>first:</mark4><br>
Till you, the best Vitruvius, come at <mark1>length;</mark1><br>
Our beauties equal; but excel our <mark1>strength.</mark1><br>
Firm Doric pillars found your solid <mark3>base:</mark3><br>
The fair Corinthian crowns the higher <mark3>space;</mark3><br>
Thus all below is strength, and all above is <mark3>grace.</mark3><br>
In easy dialogue is Fletcher's <mark4>praise:</mark4><br>
He mov'd the mind, but had not power to <mark3>raise.</mark3><br>
Great Jonson did by strength of judgment <mark4>please:</mark4><br>
Yet doubling Fletcher's force, he wants his <mark3>ease.</mark3><br>
In differing talents both adorn'd their <mark3>age;</mark3><br>
One for the study, t'other for the <mark3>stage.</mark3><br>
But both to Congreve justly shall <mark4>submit,</mark4><br>
One match'd in <mark4>judgment</mark4>, both o'er-match'd in <mark1>wit.</mark1><br>
In him all beauties of this age we <mark5>see;</mark5><br>
Etherege's courtship, Southern's <mark5>purity;</mark5><br>
The satire, wit, and strength of manly Wycherly.<br>
All this in blooming youth you have achiev'd;<br>
Nor are your foil'd contemporaries griev'd;<br>
So much the sweetness of your manners <mark4>move,</mark4><br>
We cannot envy you because we <mark4>love.</mark4><br>
Fabius might joy in Scipio, when he <mark3>saw</mark3><br>
A beardless Consul made against the <mark3>law,</mark3><br>
And join his suffrage to the votes of <mark4>Rome;</mark4><br>
Though he with Hannibal was <mark4>overcome.</mark4><br>
Thus old Romano bow'd to Raphael's <mark4>fame;</mark4><br>
And scholar to the youth he taught, <mark3>became.</mark3><br>
<br>
Oh that your brows my laurel had <mark4>sustain'd,</mark4><br>
Well had I been depos'd, if you had <mark3>reign'd!</mark3><br>
The father had descended for the <mark4>son;</mark4><br>
For only you are lineal to the <mark4>throne.</mark4><br>
Thus when the State one Edward did <mark4>depose;</mark4><br>
A greater Edward in his room <mark3>arose.</mark3><br>
But now, not I, but poetry is <mark5>curs'd;</mark5><br>
For Tom the second reigns like Tom the <mark1>first.</mark1><br>
But let 'em not mistake my patron's <mark4>part;</mark4><br>
Nor call his charity their own <mark4>desert.</mark4><br>
Yet this I prophesy; thou shalt be <mark4>seen,</mark4><br>
(Tho' with some short parenthesis <mark3>between:)</mark3><br>
High on the throne of wit; and seated <mark3>there,</mark3><br>
Not mine (that's little) but thy laurel <mark3>wear.</mark3><br>
Thy first attempt an early promise <mark4>made;</mark4><br>
That early promise this has more than <mark3>paid.</mark3><br>
So bold, yet so judiciously you <mark3>dare,</mark3><br>
That your least praise, is to be regular.<br>
Time, place, and action, may with pains be <mark4>wrought,</mark4><br>
But genius must be born; and never can be <mark3>taught.</mark3><br>
This is your portion; this your native <mark4>store;</mark4><br>
Heav'n that but once was prodigal <mark3>before,</mark3><br>
To Shakespeare gave as much; she could not give him <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
<br>
Maintain your post: that's all the fame you <mark4>need;</mark4><br>
For 'tis impossible you should <mark3>proceed.</mark3><br>
Already I am worn with cares and <mark1>age;</mark1><br>
And just abandoning th' ungrateful <mark1>stage:</mark1><br>
Unprofitably kept at Heav'n's <mark4>expense,</mark4><br>
I live a rent-charge on his <mark4>providence:</mark4><br>
But you, whom ev'ry muse and grace <mark4>adorn,</mark4><br>
Whom I foresee to better fortune <mark3>born,</mark3><br>
Be kind to my remains; and oh <mark4>defend,</mark4><br>
Against your judgment your departed <mark3>friend!</mark3><br>
Let not the insulting foe my fame <mark5>pursue;</mark5><br>
But shade those laurels which descend to <mark3>you:</mark3><br>
And take for tribute what these lines <mark4>express:</mark4><br>
You merit more; nor could my love do <mark3>less.</mark3><br>
