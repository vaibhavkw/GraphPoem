Title : The Phoenix and the Turtle <br>
Author : William Shakespeare <br><br>

Let the bird of loudest <mark3>lay</mark3><br>
On the sole Arabian <mark3>tree</mark3><br>
Herald sad and trumpet <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
To whose sound chaste wings <mark3>obey.</mark3><br>
<br>
But thou shrieking <mark4>harbinger,</mark4><br>
Foul precurrer of the <mark4>fiend,</mark4><br>
Augur of the fever's <mark4>end,</mark4><br>
To this troop come thou not <mark4>near.</mark4><br>
<br>
From this session <mark4>interdict</mark4><br>
Every fowl of tyrant <mark3>wing,</mark3><br>
Save the eagle, feather'd <mark3>king;</mark3><br>
Keep the obsequy so <mark4>strict.</mark4><br>
<br>
Let the priest in surplice <mark4>white,</mark4><br>
That defunctive music <mark4>can,</mark4><br>
Be the death-divining <mark4>swan,</mark4><br>
Lest the requiem lack his <mark3>right.</mark3><br>
<br>
And thou treble-dated <mark3>crow,</mark3><br>
That thy sable gender <mark3>mak'st</mark3><br>
With the breath thou giv'st and <mark3>tak'st,</mark3><br>
'Mongst our mourners shalt thou <mark3>go.</mark3><br>
<br>
Here the anthem doth <mark3>commence:</mark3><br>
Love and constancy is <mark4>dead;</mark4><br>
Phoenix and the Turtle <mark3>fled</mark3><br>
In a mutual flame from <mark3>hence.</mark3><br>
<br>
So they lov'd, as love in <mark4>twain</mark4><br>
Had the essence but in <mark4>one;</mark4><br>
Two distincts, division <mark3>none:</mark3><br>
Number there in love was <mark4>slain.</mark4><br>
<br>
Hearts remote, yet not <mark4>asunder;</mark4><br>
Distance and no space was <mark4>seen</mark4><br>
'Twixt this Turtle and his <mark3>queen:</mark3><br>
But in them it were a <mark3>wonder.</mark3><br>
<br>
So between them love did <mark4>shine</mark4><br>
That the Turtle saw his <mark1>right</mark1><br>
Flaming in the Phoenix' <mark3>sight:</mark3><br>
Either was the other's <mark3>mine.</mark3><br>
<br>
Property was thus <mark4>appalled</mark4><br>
That the self was not the <mark3>same;</mark3><br>
Single nature's double <mark3>name</mark3><br>
Neither two nor one was <mark3>called.</mark3><br>
<br>
Reason, in itself <mark4>confounded,</mark4><br>
Saw division grow <mark4>together,</mark4><br>
To themselves yet either <mark4>neither,</mark4><br>
Simple were so well <mark3>compounded;</mark3><br>
<br>
That it cried, "How true a <mark1>twain</mark1><br>
Seemeth this concordant <mark1>one!</mark1><br>
Love has <mark4>reason</mark4>, reason <mark1>none,</mark1><br>
If what parts can so <mark4>remain."</mark4><br>
<br>
Whereupon it made this threne <br>
To the Phoenix and the <mark3>Dove,</mark3><br>
Co-supremes and stars of <mark3>love,</mark3><br>
As chorus to their tragic <mark4>scene:</mark4><br>
<br>
Beauty, truth, and <mark4>rarity,</mark4><br>
Grace in all <mark4>simplicity,</mark4><br>
Here enclos'd, in cinders lie. <br>
<br>
Death is now the Phoenix' <mark4>nest,</mark4><br>
And the Turtle's loyal <mark3>breast</mark3><br>
To eternity doth <mark3>rest,</mark3><br>
<br>
Leaving no <mark4>posterity:</mark4><br>
'Twas not their <mark4>infirmity,</mark4><br>
It was married <mark4>chastity.</mark4><br>
<br>
Truth may seem but cannot <mark1>be;</mark1><br>
Beauty brag but 'tis not <mark3>she;</mark3><br>
Truth and beauty buried <mark1>be.</mark1><br>
<br>
To this urn let those <mark4>repair</mark4><br>
That are either true or <mark3>fair;</mark3><br>
For these dead birds sigh a <mark3>prayer.</mark3><br>
