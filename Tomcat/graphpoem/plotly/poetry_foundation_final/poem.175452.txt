Title : Conversation with a Widow <br>
Author : A. F. Moritz <br><br>

Uncle Johnny died after rigid <mark4>years</mark4><br>
of cutting hair in his shop <mark4>downtown.</mark4><br>
Toward the end he cut it badly, <mark4>breathing</mark4><br>
a whisky scent into the tonic, talc <mark3>and</mark3><br>
glossy male curls piling up on the tiled <mark4>floor.</mark4><br>
He died shrivelled, a man who seldom spoke, <br>
still with that nickname, Johnny, <mark4>last</mark4><br>
taciturn hint of a youth who may have <mark4>been</mark4><br>
angry, a lover of women, filled and <mark3>lightened</mark3><br>
by vast ocean, the sky over America. <br>
He spent his time at home, <mark4>silent,</mark4><br>
or sometimes in bars, or on the corner <br>
by King's Newsstand with others like himself <br>
on sun-baked cement, spitting single words, <mark4>standing</mark4><br>
in dark slacks, short-sleeved shirts and <mark4>suspenders.</mark4><br>
The tall and narrow-waisted new <mark4>world</mark4><br>
had by that time completely rejected <mark1>suspenders.</mark1><br>
And after the funeral Mary, his wife, was <mark4>crying</mark4><br>
and said to me, "Why is it that the <mark4>men</mark4><br>
always die sooner? Do they just give <mark4>up?"</mark4><br>
We stood there in the church of our fathers, who <br>
explained their own deaths, all death, by an ancient crime. <br>
How foolish it would have been to tell you, <mark4>Mary,</mark4><br>
something about dioxyribonucleic <mark4>acid,</mark4><br>
adaptation of the <mark4>sexes</mark4>, effects of the <mark4>hormones,</mark4><br>
or social factors, things you'd listen to <mark4>blankly.</mark4><br>
Better to say that what we find in <mark4>ourselves,</mark4><br>
whatever weakness, we ourselves have put <mark4>there.</mark4><br>
Both of us knew enough about men's <mark4>weakness.</mark4><br>
Your question didn't need an answer: I <br>
simply shrugged and silently, without real <mark4>hope,</mark4><br>
asked to be absolved from the fault of <mark1>men:</mark1><br>
Powers of <mark4>earth</mark4>, give me the male <mark4>strength</mark4><br>
that we desire, kindly strength, which <mark4>protects.</mark4><br>
Don't make my wife a nurse, <mark4>helplessly</mark4><br>
to watch me dying drunk and before her. <br>
And do not punish me for pride <mark4>because</mark4><br>
I've asked to be so strong: to be the <mark1>last.</mark1><br>
