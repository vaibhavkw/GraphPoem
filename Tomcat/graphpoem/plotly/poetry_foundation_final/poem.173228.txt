Title : Constancy to an Ideal Object <br>
Author : Samuel Taylor Coleridge <br><br>

Since all that beat about in Nature's <mark3>range,</mark3><br>
Or veer or vanish; why should'st thou <mark3>remain</mark3><br>
The only constant in a world of <mark3>change,</mark3><br>
O yearning Thought! that liv'st but in the <mark3>brain?</mark3><br>
Call to the Hours, that in the distance <mark3>play,</mark3><br>
The faery people of the future <mark3>day--</mark3><br>
Fond Thought! not one of all that shining <mark3>swarm</mark3><br>
Will breathe on thee with life-enkindling <mark3>breath,</mark3><br>
Till when, like strangers shelt'ring from a <mark3>storm,</mark3><br>
Hope and Despair meet in the porch of <mark3>Death!</mark3><br>
Yet still thou haunt'st <mark3>me</mark3>, and though well I <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
She is not thou, and only thou are <mark3>she,</mark3><br>
Still, still as though some dear embodied <mark3>Good,</mark3><br>
Some living Love before my eyes there <mark3>stood</mark3><br>
With answering look a ready ear to <mark4>lend,</mark4><br>
I mourn to thee and say--'Ah! loveliest <mark3>friend!</mark3><br>
That this the meed of all my toils might <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
To have a home, an English home, and <mark3>thee!'</mark3><br>
Vain repetition! Home and Thou are <mark4>one.</mark4><br>
The peacefull'st cot, the moon shall shine <mark4>upon,</mark4><br>
Lulled by the thrush and wakened by the <mark3>lark,</mark3><br>
Without thee were but a becalm{'e}d <mark3>bark,</mark3><br>
Whose Helmsman on an ocean waste and <mark4>wide</mark4><br>
Sits mute and pale his mouldering helm <mark3>beside.</mark3><br>
<br>
And art thou nothing? Such thou art, as <mark4>when</mark4><br>
The woodman winding westward up the <mark3>glen</mark3><br>
At wintry dawn, where o'er the sheep-track's <mark3>maze</mark3><br>
The viewless snow-mist weaves a glist'ning <mark3>haze,</mark3><br>
Sees full before him, gliding without <mark4>tread,</mark4><br>
An image with a glory round its <mark3>head;</mark3><br>
The enamoured rustic worships its fair <mark4>hues,</mark4><br>
Nor knows he makes the shadow, he <mark3>pursues!</mark3><br>
