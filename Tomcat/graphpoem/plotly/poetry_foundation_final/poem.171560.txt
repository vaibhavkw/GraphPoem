Title : Double Elegy <br>
Author : Michael S. Harper <br><br>

Whatever city or country <mark4>road</mark4><br>
you two are <mark4>on</mark4><br>
there are <mark4>nettles,</mark4><br>
and the dark <mark4>invisible</mark4><br>
elements cling to your <mark4>skin</mark4><br>
though you do not <mark3>cry</mark3><br>
and you do not scratch <br>
your arms at forty-five degree <mark4>angles</mark4><br>
as the landing point of a <mark4>swan</mark4><br>
in the Ohio, the Detroit <mark4>River;</mark4><br>
<br>
at the Paradise <mark4>Theatre</mark4><br>
you named the <mark4>cellist</mark4><br>
with the fanatical <mark4>fingers</mark4><br>
of the plumber, the <mark4>exorcist,</mark4><br>
and though the gimmicky at <mark4>wrist</mark4><br>
and kneecaps could lift the <mark4>seance</mark4><br>
<mark4>table</mark4>, your voice was <mark4>real</mark4><br>
in the gait and laughter of <mark4>Uncle</mark4><br>
Henry, who could dance on <mark4>either</mark4><br>
leg, wooden or real, to the <mark4>sound</mark4><br>
of the troop <mark4>train</mark4>, <mark4>megaphone,</mark4><br>
catching the fine pitch of a <mark4>singer</mark4><br>
on the athletic fields of Virginia. <br>
<br>
At the Radisson <mark4>Hotel,</mark4><br>
we once took a fine <mark4>angel</mark4><br>
of the law to the convention <mark4>center,</mark4><br>
and put her down as an <mark4>egret</mark4><br>
in the subzero platform of a <mark4>friend--</mark4><br>
this is Minneapolis, the <mark4>movies</mark4><br>
are all of <mark4>strangers</mark4>, holding <mark4>themselves</mark4><br>
in the delicacy of treading <mark4>water,</mark4><br>
while they wait for the <mark4>trumpet</mark4><br>
of the 20th Century <mark4>Limited</mark4><br>
over the bluff or cranny. <br>
You two men like to <mark4>confront.</mark4><br>
the craters of history and <mark4>spillage,</mark4><br>
our natural infections of you   <br>
innoculating blankets and fur,   <br>
ethos of cadaver and <mark4>sunflower.</mark4><br>
<br>
I hold the dogwood blossom, <br>
eat the pear, and watch the <mark4>nettle</mark4><br>
swim up in the <mark4>pools</mark4><br>
of the completed song <br>
of Leadbelly and Little Crow   <br>
crooning the buffalo and <mark4>horse</mark4><br>
to the changes and the <mark4>bridge</mark4><br>
of a twelve-string guitar, <br>
the melody of <mark4>"Irene";</mark4><br>
this is really <mark3>goodbye--</mark3><br>
I can see the precious <mark4>stones</mark4><br>
of embolism and <mark4>consumption</mark4><br>
on the platinum wires of the mouth: <br>
in the flowing rivers, in the public <mark4>baths</mark4><br>
of Ohio and <mark4>Michigan.</mark4><br>
