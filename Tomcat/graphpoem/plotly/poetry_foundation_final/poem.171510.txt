Aristotle was a little man with <br>
eyes like a lizard, and he found a streak <br>
down the midst of things, a smooth place for his <mark4>feet</mark4><br>
much more important than the carved <mark4>handles</mark4><br>
on the coffins of the <mark4>great.</mark4><br>
<br>
He said you should put your hand <mark4>out</mark4><br>
at the time and place of <mark4>need:</mark4><br>
strength matters little, he <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
nor even <mark4>speed.</mark4><br>
<br>
His pupil, a king's son, <mark4>died</mark4><br>
at an early age. That Aristotle spoke of him   <br>
it is impossible to find--the youth <mark4>was</mark4><br>
notorious, a conqueror, a kid with a <mark4>gang,</mark4><br>
but even this Aristotle didn't ever say. <br>
<br>
Around the farthest forest and <mark4>along</mark4><br>
all the bed of the sea, Aristotle <mark4>studied</mark4><br>
immediate, local ways. Many of which   <br>
were wrong. So he studied poetry.   <br>
There, in pity and fear, he found <mark4>Man.</mark4><br>
<br>
Many thinkers today, who stand low and <mark4>grin,</mark4><br>
have little use for anger or power, its palace   <br>
or its <mark4>prison--</mark4><br>
but quite a bit for that little <mark1>man</mark1><br>
with eyes like a <mark4>lizard.</mark4><br>
