Title : February Evening in New York <br>
Author : Denise Levertov <br><br>

As the stores close, a winter <mark4>light</mark4><br>
    opens air to iris blue, <br>
glint of frost through the <mark4>smoke</mark4><br>
grains of mica, salt of the <mark4>sidewalk.</mark4><br>
As the buildings <mark4>close</mark4>, released <mark4>autonomous</mark4><br>
feet pattern the <mark4>streets</mark4><br>
in hurry and stroll; balloon <mark4>heads</mark4><br>
drift and dive above them; the <mark4>bodies</mark4><br>
    aren't really there. <br>
As the lights brighten, as the sky darkens, <br>
    a woman with crooked heels says to another woman   <br>
while they step along at a fair <mark4>pace,</mark4><br>
"You know, I'm telling you, what I love <mark4>best</mark4><br>
is life. I love life! Even if I ever <mark4>get</mark4><br>
    to be old and wheezy--or limp! You know?   <br>
Limping along?--I'd still ... " Out of <mark5>hearing.</mark5><br>
To the multiple disordered <mark4>tones</mark4><br>
of gears changing, a <mark4>dance</mark4><br>
    to the compass points, out, four-way river.   <br>
    Prospect of sky <br>
wedged into avenues, left at the ends of <mark1>streets,</mark1><br>
    west sky, east sky: more life tonight! A range   <br>
of open time at winter's <mark4>outskirts.</mark4><br>
