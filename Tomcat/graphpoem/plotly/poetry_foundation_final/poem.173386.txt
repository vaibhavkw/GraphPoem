Title : The Triple Fool <br>
Author : John Donne <br><br>

I am two fools, I <mark3>know,</mark3><br>
For loving, and for saying <mark3>so</mark3><br>
In whining <mark4>poetry;</mark4><br>
But where's that wiseman, that would not be <mark3>I,</mark3><br>
If she would not <mark3>deny?</mark3><br>
Then as th' earth's inward narrow crooked <mark3>lanes</mark3><br>
Do purge sea water's fretful salt <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
I thought, if I could draw my <mark3>pains</mark3><br>
Through rhyme's vexation, I should them <mark3>allay.</mark3><br>
Grief brought to numbers cannot be so <mark4>fierce,</mark4><br>
For he tames it, that fetters it in <mark4>verse.</mark4><br>
<br>
But when I have done <mark1>so,</mark1><br>
Some man, his art and voice to <mark3>show,</mark3><br>
Doth set and sing my <mark5>pain;</mark5><br>
And, by delighting many, frees <mark3>again</mark3><br>
Grief, which verse did <mark3>restrain.</mark3><br>
To love and grief tribute of verse <mark4>belongs,</mark4><br>
    But not of such as pleases when 'tis read. <br>
Both are increased by such <mark3>songs,</mark3><br>
    For both their triumphs so are published, <br>
And I, which was two fools, do so grow <mark3>three;</mark3><br>
Who are a little wise, the best fools <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
