PART <mark3>I</mark3><br>
'Tis the middle of night by the castle <mark3>clock,</mark3><br>
And the owls have awakened the crowing <mark3>cock;</mark3><br>
Tu--whit! <mark1>Tu--whoo!</mark1><br>
And <mark4>hark</mark4>, again! the crowing <mark1>cock,</mark1><br>
How drowsily it <mark3>crew.</mark3><br>
Sir Leoline, the Baron <mark3>rich,</mark3><br>
Hath a toothless mastiff <mark3>bitch;</mark3><br>
From her kennel beneath the <mark3>rock</mark3><br>
She maketh answer to the <mark1>clock,</mark1><br>
Four for the quarters, and twelve for the <mark3>hour;</mark3><br>
Ever and aye, by shine and <mark3>shower,</mark3><br>
Sixteen short howls, not over <mark3>loud;</mark3><br>
Some say, she sees my lady's <mark3>shroud.</mark3><br>
<br>
Is the night chilly and <mark4>dark?</mark4><br>
The night is chilly, but not <mark1>dark.</mark1><br>
The thin gray cloud is spread on <mark3>high,</mark3><br>
It covers but not hides the <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
The moon is behind, and at the <mark4>full;</mark4><br>
And yet she looks both small and <mark4>dull.</mark4><br>
The night is chill, the cloud is <mark3>gray:</mark3><br>
'Tis a month before the month of <mark3>May,</mark3><br>
And the Spring comes slowly up this <mark3>way.</mark3><br>
<br>
The lovely lady, <mark1>Christabel,</mark1><br>
Whom her father loves so <mark4>well,</mark4><br>
What makes her in the wood so <mark3>late,</mark3><br>
A furlong from the castle <mark3>gate?</mark3><br>
She had dreams all <mark5>yesternight</mark5><br>
Of her own betrothed <mark4>knight;</mark4><br>
And she in the midnight wood will <mark3>pray</mark3><br>
For the weal of her lover that's far <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
<br>
She stole along, she nothing <mark4>spoke,</mark4><br>
The sighs she heaved were soft and <mark3>low,</mark3><br>
And naught was green upon the <mark3>oak</mark3><br>
But moss and rarest misletoe: <br>
She kneels beneath the huge oak <mark3>tree,</mark3><br>
And in silence prayeth <mark3>she.</mark3><br>
<br>
The lady sprang up <mark4>suddenly,</mark4><br>
The lovely lady <mark1>Christabel!</mark1><br>
It moaned as near, as near can <mark4>be,</mark4><br>
But what it is she cannot <mark3>tell.--</mark3><br>
On the other side it seems to <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
Of the huge, broad-breasted, old oak <mark1>tree.</mark1><br>
<br>
The night is chill; the forest <mark4>bare;</mark4><br>
Is it the wind that moaneth <mark4>bleak?</mark4><br>
There is not wind enough in the <mark3>air</mark3><br>
To move away the ringlet <mark4>curl</mark4><br>
From the lovely lady's <mark3>cheek--</mark3><br>
There is not wind enough to <mark3>twirl</mark3><br>
The one red leaf, the last of its <mark3>clan,</mark3><br>
That dances as often as dance it <mark3>can,</mark3><br>
Hanging so light, and hanging so <mark1>high,</mark1><br>
On the topmost twig that looks up at the <mark1>sky.</mark1><br>
<br>
Hush, beating heart of <mark1>Christabel!</mark1><br>
Jesu, Maria, shield her <mark1>well!</mark1><br>
She folded her arms beneath her <mark4>cloak,</mark4><br>
And stole to the other side of the <mark1>oak.</mark1><br>
What sees she <mark3>there?</mark3><br>
<br>
There she sees a damsel <mark3>bright,</mark3><br>
Drest in a silken robe of <mark3>white,</mark3><br>
That shadowy in the moonlight <mark4>shone:</mark4><br>
The neck that made that white robe <mark4>wan,</mark4><br>
Her stately neck, and arms were <mark1>bare;</mark1><br>
Her blue-veined feet unsandl'd <mark1>were,</mark1><br>
And wildly glittered here and <mark1>there</mark1><br>
The gems entangled in her <mark3>hair.</mark3><br>
I guess, 'twas frightful there to <mark3>see</mark3><br>
A lady so richly clad as <mark1>she--</mark1><br>
Beautiful <mark4>exceedingly!</mark4><br>
<br>
Mary mother, save me <mark3>now!</mark3><br>
(Said Christabel) And who art <mark3>thou?</mark3><br>
<br>
The lady strange made answer <mark4>meet,</mark4><br>
And her voice was faint and <mark3>sweet:--</mark3><br>
Have pity on my sore <mark4>distress,</mark4><br>
I scarce can speak for <mark4>weariness:</mark4><br>
Stretch forth thy hand, and have no <mark4>fear!</mark4><br>
Said Christabel, How camest thou <mark4>here?</mark4><br>
And the lady, whose voice was faint and <mark1>sweet,</mark1><br>
Did thus pursue her answer <mark1>meet:--</mark1><br>
<br>
My sire is of a noble <mark4>line,</mark4><br>
And my name is <mark4>Geraldine:</mark4><br>
Five warriors seized me <mark5>yestermorn,</mark5><br>
Me, even me, a maid <mark4>forlorn:</mark4><br>
They choked my cries with force and <mark4>fright,</mark4><br>
And tied me on a palfrey <mark1>white.</mark1><br>
The palfrey was as fleet as <mark4>wind,</mark4><br>
And they rode furiously <mark3>behind.</mark3><br>
They spurred amain, their steeds were <mark1>white:</mark1><br>
And once we crossed the shade of <mark3>night.</mark3><br>
As sure as Heaven shall rescue <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
I have no thought what men they <mark1>be;</mark1><br>
Nor do I know how long it <mark4>is</mark4><br>
(For I have lain entranced I <mark4>wis)</mark4><br>
Since one, the tallest of the <mark3>five,</mark3><br>
Took me from the palfrey's <mark4>back,</mark4><br>
A weary woman, scarce <mark3>alive.</mark3><br>
Some muttered words his comrades <mark1>spoke:</mark1><br>
He placed me underneath this <mark1>oak;</mark1><br>
He swore they would return with <mark4>haste;</mark4><br>
Whither they went I cannot <mark1>tell--</mark1><br>
I thought I heard, some minutes <mark4>past,</mark4><br>
Sounds as of a castle <mark3>bell.</mark3><br>
Stretch forth thy hand (thus ended <mark1>she).</mark1><br>
And help a wretched maid to <mark3>flee.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then Christabel stretched forth her <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
And comforted fair <mark1>Geraldine:</mark1><br>
O well, bright dame! may you <mark3>command</mark3><br>
The service of Sir <mark1>Leoline;</mark1><br>
And gladly our stout <mark4>chivalry</mark4><br>
Will he send forth and friends <mark5>withal</mark5><br>
To guide and guard you safe and <mark3>free</mark3><br>
Home to your noble father's <mark4>hall.</mark4><br>
<br>
She rose: and forth with steps they <mark2>passed</mark2><br>
That strove to be, and were <mark4>not</mark4>, <mark3>fast.</mark3><br>
Her gracious stars the lady <mark4>blest,</mark4><br>
And thus spake on sweet <mark1>Christabel:</mark1><br>
All our household are at <mark3>rest,</mark3><br>
The hall as silent as the <mark4>cell;</mark4><br>
Sir Leoline is weak in <mark3>health,</mark3><br>
And may not well awakened <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
But we will move as if in <mark3>stealth,</mark3><br>
And I beseech your <mark4>courtesy,</mark4><br>
This night, to share your couch with <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
<br>
They crossed the moat, and <mark1>Christabel</mark1><br>
Took the key that fitted <mark1>well;</mark1><br>
A little door she opened <mark4>straight,</mark4><br>
All in the middle of the <mark1>gate;</mark1><br>
The gate that was ironed within and <mark4>without,</mark4><br>
Where an army in battle array had marched <mark3>out.</mark3><br>
The lady sank, belike through <mark4>pain,</mark4><br>
And Christabel with might and <mark3>main</mark3><br>
Lifted her up, a weary <mark4>weight,</mark4><br>
Over the threshold of the <mark1>gate:</mark1><br>
Then the lady rose <mark3>again,</mark3><br>
And moved, as she were not in <mark1>pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
So free from danger, free from <mark1>fear,</mark1><br>
They crossed the court: right glad they <mark1>were.</mark1><br>
And Christabel devoutly <mark4>cried</mark4><br>
To the lady by her <mark3>side,</mark3><br>
Praise we the Virgin all <mark4>divine</mark4><br>
Who hath rescued thee from thy <mark1>distress!</mark1><br>
Alas, alas! said <mark1>Geraldine,</mark1><br>
I cannot speak for <mark1>weariness.</mark1><br>
So free from danger, free from <mark1>fear,</mark1><br>
They crossed the court: right glad they <mark1>were.</mark1><br>
<br>
Outside her kennel, the mastiff <mark4>old</mark4><br>
Lay fast asleep, in moonshine <mark3>cold.</mark3><br>
The mastiff old did not <mark4>awake,</mark4><br>
Yet she an angry moan did <mark3>make!</mark3><br>
And what can ail the mastiff <mark1>bitch?</mark1><br>
Never till now she uttered <mark3>yell</mark3><br>
Beneath the eye of <mark1>Christabel.</mark1><br>
Perhaps it is the owlet's scritch: <br>
For what can ail the mastiff <mark1>bitch?</mark1><br>
<br>
They passed the <mark4>hall</mark4>, that echoes <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
Pass as lightly as you <mark3>will!</mark3><br>
The brands were flat, the brands were <mark3>dying,</mark3><br>
Amid their own white ashes <mark3>lying;</mark3><br>
But when the lady passed, there <mark3>came</mark3><br>
A tongue of light, a fit of <mark3>flame;</mark3><br>
And Christabel saw the lady's <mark3>eye,</mark3><br>
And nothing else saw she <mark3>thereby,</mark3><br>
Save the boss of the shield of Sir Leoline <mark4>tall,</mark4><br>
Which hung in a murky old niche in the <mark3>wall.</mark3><br>
O softly tread, said <mark1>Christabel,</mark1><br>
My father seldom sleepeth <mark1>well.</mark1><br>
<br>
Sweet Christabel her feet doth <mark1>bare,</mark1><br>
And jealous of the listening <mark1>air</mark1><br>
They steal their way from stair to <mark3>stair,</mark3><br>
Now in glimmer, and now in <mark4>gloom,</mark4><br>
And now they pass the Baron's <mark3>room,</mark3><br>
As still as <mark3>death</mark3>, with stifled <mark4>breath!</mark4><br>
And now have reached her chamber <mark4>door;</mark4><br>
And now doth Geraldine press <mark4>down</mark4><br>
The rushes of the chamber <mark3>floor.</mark3><br>
<br>
The moon shines dim in the open <mark1>air,</mark1><br>
And not a moonbeam enters <mark1>here.</mark1><br>
But they without its light can <mark1>see</mark1><br>
The chamber carved so <mark4>curiously,</mark4><br>
Carved with figures strange and <mark1>sweet,</mark1><br>
All made out of the carver's <mark4>brain,</mark4><br>
For a lady's chamber <mark1>meet:</mark1><br>
The lamp with twofold silver <mark3>chain</mark3><br>
Is fastened to an angel's <mark3>feet.</mark3><br>
<br>
The silver lamp burns dead and <mark4>dim;</mark4><br>
But Christabel the lamp will <mark3>trim.</mark3><br>
She trimmed the lamp, and made it <mark1>bright,</mark1><br>
And left it swinging to and <mark3>fro,</mark3><br>
While Geraldine, in wretched <mark3>plight,</mark3><br>
Sank down upon the floor <mark3>below.</mark3><br>
<br>
O weary lady, <mark1>Geraldine,</mark1><br>
I pray you, drink this cordial <mark4>wine!</mark4><br>
It is a wine of virtuous <mark4>powers;</mark4><br>
My mother made it of wild <mark3>flowers.</mark3><br>
<br>
And will your mother pity <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Who am a maiden most <mark1>forlorn?</mark1><br>
Christabel answered--Woe is <mark1>me!</mark1><br>
She died the hour that I was <mark3>born.</mark3><br>
I have heard the grey-haired friar <mark1>tell</mark1><br>
How on her death-bed she did <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
That she should hear the <mark3>castle-bell</mark3><br>
Strike twelve upon my <mark3>wedding-day.</mark3><br>
O mother dear! that thou wert <mark1>here!</mark1><br>
I would, said Geraldine, she <mark1>were!</mark1><br>
<br>
But soon with altered voice, said <mark1>she--</mark1><br>
'Off, wandering mother! Peak and <mark4>pine!</mark4><br>
I have power to bid thee <mark1>flee.'</mark1><br>
Alas! what ails poor <mark1>Geraldine?</mark1><br>
Why stares she with unsettled <mark1>eye?</mark1><br>
Can she the bodiless dead <mark4>espy?</mark4><br>
<br>
And why with hollow voice cries <mark1>she,</mark1><br>
'Off, <mark4>woman</mark4>, off! this hour is <mark4>mine--</mark4><br>
Though thou her guardian spirit <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
Off, woman, off! 'tis given to <mark1>me.'</mark1><br>
<br>
Then Christabel knelt by the lady's <mark1>side,</mark1><br>
And raised to heaven her eyes so <mark3>blue--</mark3><br>
Alas! said she, this ghastly <mark3>ride--</mark3><br>
Dear lady! it hath wildered <mark3>you!</mark3><br>
The lady wiped her moist cold <mark3>brow,</mark3><br>
And faintly said, ' 'tis over <mark1>now!'</mark1><br>
<br>
Again the wild-flower wine she <mark4>drank:</mark4><br>
Her fair large eyes 'gan glitter <mark1>bright,</mark1><br>
And from the floor whereon she <mark3>sank,</mark3><br>
The lofty lady stood <mark3>upright:</mark3><br>
She was most beautiful to <mark1>see,</mark1><br>
Like a lady of a far <mark5>countree.</mark5><br>
<br>
And thus the lofty lady <mark4>spake--</mark4><br>
'All they who live in the upper <mark1>sky,</mark1><br>
Do love you, holy <mark1>Christabel!</mark1><br>
And you love them, and for their <mark3>sake</mark3><br>
And for the good which me befel, <br>
Even I in my degree will <mark3>try,</mark3><br>
Fair maiden, to requite you <mark1>well.</mark1><br>
But now unrobe yourself; for <mark1>I</mark1><br>
Must pray, ere yet in bed I <mark3>lie.'</mark3><br>
<br>
Quoth Christabel, So let it <mark1>be!</mark1><br>
And as the lady bade, did <mark1>she.</mark1><br>
Her gentle limbs did she <mark4>undress,</mark4><br>
And lay down in her <mark5>loveliness.</mark5><br>
<br>
But through her brain of weal and <mark3>woe</mark3><br>
So many thoughts moved to and <mark1>fro,</mark1><br>
That vain it were her lids to <mark4>close;</mark4><br>
So half-way from the bed she <mark3>rose,</mark3><br>
And on her elbow did <mark3>recline</mark3><br>
To look at the lady <mark1>Geraldine.</mark1><br>
<br>
Beneath the lamp the lady <mark4>bowed,</mark4><br>
And slowly rolled her eyes <mark4>around;</mark4><br>
Then drawing in her breath <mark3>aloud,</mark3><br>
Like one that <mark4>shuddered</mark4>, she <mark4>unbound</mark4><br>
The cincture from beneath her <mark4>breast:</mark4><br>
Her silken robe, and inner <mark3>vest,</mark3><br>
Dropt to her feet, and full in <mark3>view,</mark3><br>
Behold! her bosom and half her <mark1>side--</mark1><br>
A sight to dream of, not to <mark1>tell!</mark1><br>
O shield her! shield sweet <mark1>Christabel!</mark1><br>
<br>
Yet Geraldine nor speaks nor <mark4>stirs;</mark4><br>
Ah! what a stricken look was <mark3>hers!</mark3><br>
Deep from within she seems <mark3>half-way</mark3><br>
To lift some weight with sick <mark4>assay,</mark4><br>
And eyes the maid and seeks <mark3>delay;</mark3><br>
Then suddenly, as one <mark3>defied,</mark3><br>
Collects herself in scorn and <mark3>pride,</mark3><br>
And lay down by the Maiden's <mark1>side!--</mark1><br>
And in her arms the maid she <mark4>took,</mark4><br>
Ah <mark3>wel-a-day!</mark3><br>
And with low voice and doleful <mark3>look</mark3><br>
These words did <mark1>say:</mark1><br>
'In the touch of this bosom there worketh a <mark3>spell,</mark3><br>
Which is lord of thy utterance, <mark1>Christabel!</mark1><br>
Thou knowest to-night, and wilt know to-morrow, <br>
This mark of my shame, this seal of my sorrow; <br>
       But vainly thou warrest, <br>
For this is alone <mark4>in</mark4><br>
Thy power to <mark4>declare,</mark4><br>
That in the dim <mark4>forest</mark4><br>
Thou heard'st a low <mark4>moaning,</mark4><br>
And found'st a bright lady, surpassingly <mark3>fair;</mark3><br>
And didst bring her home with thee in love and in <mark4>charity,</mark4><br>
To shield her and shelter her from the damp <mark1>air.'</mark1><br>
<br>
THE CONCLUSION TO PART <mark1>I</mark1><br>
It was a lovely sight to <mark1>see</mark1><br>
The lady Christabel, when <mark1>she</mark1><br>
Was praying at the old oak <mark1>tree.</mark1><br>
Amid the jagged <mark4>shadows</mark4><br>
Of mossy leafless <mark4>boughs,</mark4><br>
Kneeling in the <mark4>moonlight,</mark4><br>
To make her gentle <mark3>vows;</mark3><br>
Her slender palms together <mark4>prest,</mark4><br>
Heaving sometimes on her <mark1>breast;</mark1><br>
Her face resigned to bliss or <mark4>bale--</mark4><br>
Her face, oh call it fair not <mark3>pale,</mark3><br>
And both blue eyes more bright than <mark4>clear,</mark4><br>
Each about to have a <mark3>tear.</mark3><br>
<br>
With open eyes (ah woe is <mark1>me!)</mark1><br>
Asleep, and dreaming <mark5>fearfully,</mark5><br>
Fearfully dreaming, yet, I <mark1>wis,</mark1><br>
Dreaming that alone, which <mark1>is--</mark1><br>
O sorrow and shame! Can this be <mark1>she,</mark1><br>
The lady, who knelt at the old oak <mark1>tree?</mark1><br>
And lo! the worker of these <mark4>harms,</mark4><br>
That holds the maiden in her <mark3>arms,</mark3><br>
Seems to slumber still and <mark4>mild,</mark4><br>
As a mother with her <mark3>child.</mark3><br>
<br>
A star hath set, a star hath <mark4>risen,</mark4><br>
O Geraldine! since arms of <mark4>thine</mark4><br>
Have been the lovely lady's <mark4>prison.</mark4><br>
O Geraldine! one hour was <mark1>thine--</mark1><br>
Thou'st had thy will! By tairn and <mark4>rill,</mark4><br>
The night-birds all that hour were <mark1>still.</mark1><br>
But now they are jubilant <mark3>anew,</mark3><br>
From cliffand tower, tu--whoo! <mark1>tu--whoo!</mark1><br>
Tu--whoo! tu--whoo! from wood and <mark4>fell!</mark4><br>
<br>
And see! the lady <mark1>Christabel</mark1><br>
Gathers herself from out her <mark4>trance;</mark4><br>
Her limbs <mark4>relax</mark4>, her <mark4>countenance</mark4><br>
Grows sad and soft; the smooth thin <mark4>lids</mark4><br>
Close o'er her <mark4>eyes</mark4>, and tears she <mark4>sheds--</mark4><br>
Large tears that leave the lashes <mark1>bright!</mark1><br>
And oft the while she seems to <mark4>smile</mark4><br>
As infants at a sudden <mark3>light!</mark3><br>
<br>
Yea, she doth smile, and she doth <mark3>weep,</mark3><br>
Like a youthful <mark5>hermitess,</mark5><br>
Beauteous in a <mark4>wilderness,</mark4><br>
Who, praying always, prays in <mark3>sleep.</mark3><br>
And, if she move unquietly, <br>
Perchance, 'tis but the blood so <mark1>free</mark1><br>
Comes back and tingles in her <mark1>feet.</mark1><br>
No <mark4>doubt</mark4>, she hath a vision <mark1>sweet.</mark1><br>
What if her guardian spirit 'twere, <br>
What if she knew her mother <mark3>near?</mark3><br>
But this she <mark3>knows</mark3>, in joys and <mark4>woes,</mark4><br>
That saints will aid if men will <mark4>call:</mark4><br>
For the blue sky bends over <mark3>all!</mark3><br>
<br>
PART <mark1>II</mark1><br>
Each matin bell, the Baron saith, <br>
Knells us back to a world of <mark3>death.</mark3><br>
These words Sir Leoline first <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
When he rose and found his lady <mark3>dead:</mark3><br>
These words Sir Leoline will <mark1>say</mark1><br>
Many a morn to his dying <mark3>day!</mark3><br>
<br>
And hence the custom and law <mark4>began</mark4><br>
That still at dawn the <mark1>sacristan,</mark1><br>
Who duly pulls the heavy <mark1>bell,</mark1><br>
Five and forty beads must <mark1>tell</mark1><br>
Between each stroke--a warning <mark3>knell,</mark3><br>
Which not a soul can choose but <mark4>hear</mark4><br>
From Bratha Head to Wyndermere. <br>
<br>
Saith Bracy the bard, So let it <mark1>knell!</mark1><br>
And let the drowsy <mark1>sacristan</mark1><br>
Still count as slowly as he <mark1>can!</mark1><br>
There is no lack of such, I <mark5>ween,</mark5><br>
As well fill up the space <mark4>between.</mark4><br>
In Langdale Pike and Witch's <mark4>Lair,</mark4><br>
And Dungeon-ghyll so foully <mark4>rent,</mark4><br>
With ropes of rock and bells of <mark1>air</mark1><br>
Three sinful sextons' ghosts are <mark3>pent,</mark3><br>
Who all give back, one after <mark4>t'other,</mark4><br>
The death-note to their living <mark4>brother;</mark4><br>
And oft too, by the knell <mark4>offended,</mark4><br>
Just as their one! two! three! is <mark3>ended,</mark3><br>
The devil mocks the doleful <mark4>tale</mark4><br>
With a merry peal from Borodale. <br>
<br>
The air is still! through mist and <mark4>cloud</mark4><br>
That merry peal comes ringing <mark1>loud;</mark1><br>
And Geraldine shakes off her <mark4>dread,</mark4><br>
And rises lightly from the <mark3>bed;</mark3><br>
Puts on her silken vestments <mark1>white,</mark1><br>
And tricks her hair in lovely <mark1>plight,</mark1><br>
And nothing doubting of her <mark1>spell</mark1><br>
Awakens the lady <mark1>Christabel.</mark1><br>
'Sleep you, sweet lady <mark1>Christabel?</mark1><br>
I trust that you have rested <mark1>well.'</mark1><br>
<br>
And Christabel awoke and <mark4>spied</mark4><br>
The same who lay down by her <mark1>side--</mark1><br>
O rather say, the same whom <mark1>she</mark1><br>
Raised up beneath the old oak <mark1>tree!</mark1><br>
Nay, fairer yet! and yet more <mark1>fair!</mark1><br>
For she belike hath drunken <mark3>deep</mark3><br>
Of all the blessedness of <mark1>sleep!</mark1><br>
And while she spake, her looks, her <mark1>air</mark1><br>
Such gentle thankfulness <mark1>declare,</mark1><br>
That (so it seemed) her girded <mark4>vests</mark4><br>
Grew tight beneath her heaving <mark3>breasts.</mark3><br>
'Sure I have sinn'd!' said <mark1>Christabel,</mark1><br>
'Now heaven be praised if all be <mark1>well!'</mark1><br>
<br>
And in low faltering tones, yet <mark1>sweet,</mark1><br>
Did she the lofty lady <mark3>greet</mark3><br>
With such perplexity of <mark4>mind</mark4><br>
As dreams too lively leave <mark1>behind.</mark1><br>
<br>
So quickly she rose, and quickly <mark4>arrayed</mark4><br>
Her maiden limbs, and having <mark3>prayed</mark3><br>
That He, who on the cross did <mark4>groan,</mark4><br>
Might wash away her sins <mark3>unknown,</mark3><br>
She forthwith led fair <mark1>Geraldine</mark1><br>
To meet her sire, Sir <mark1>Leoline.</mark1><br>
<br>
The lovely maid and the lady <mark1>tall</mark1><br>
Are pacing both into the <mark1>hall,</mark1><br>
And pacing on through page and <mark4>groom,</mark4><br>
Enter the Baron's <mark3>presence-room.</mark3><br>
<br>
The Baron rose, and while he <mark1>prest</mark1><br>
His gentle daughter to his <mark1>breast,</mark1><br>
With cheerful wonder in his <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
The lady Geraldine <mark5>espies,</mark5><br>
And gave such welcome to the <mark4>same,</mark4><br>
As might beseem so bright a <mark3>dame!</mark3><br>
<br>
But when he heard the lady's <mark1>tale,</mark1><br>
And when she told her father's <mark3>name,</mark3><br>
Why waxed Sir Leoline so <mark1>pale,</mark1><br>
Murmuring o'er the name <mark1>again,</mark1><br>
Lord Roland de Vaux of <mark1>Tryermaine?</mark1><br>
Alas! they had been friends in <mark4>youth;</mark4><br>
But whispering tongues can poison <mark3>truth;</mark3><br>
And constancy lives in realms <mark4>above;</mark4><br>
And life is thorny; and youth is <mark3>vain;</mark3><br>
And to be wroth with one we <mark3>love</mark3><br>
Doth work like madness in the <mark1>brain.</mark1><br>
And thus it chanced, as I <mark1>divine,</mark1><br>
With Roland and Sir <mark1>Leoline.</mark1><br>
Each spake words of high <mark4>disdain</mark4><br>
And insult to his heart's best <mark1>brother:</mark1><br>
They parted--ne'er to meet <mark1>again!</mark1><br>
But never either found <mark3>another</mark3><br>
To free the hollow heart from <mark5>paining--</mark5><br>
They stood aloof, the scars <mark4>remaining,</mark4><br>
Like cliffs which had been rent <mark4>asunder;</mark4><br>
A dreary sea now flows <mark1>between;--</mark1><br>
But neither heat, nor frost, nor <mark3>thunder,</mark3><br>
Shall wholly do away, I <mark1>ween,</mark1><br>
The marks of that which once hath <mark4>been.</mark4><br>
<br>
Sir Leoline, a moment's <mark4>space,</mark4><br>
Stood gazing on the damsel's <mark3>face:</mark3><br>
And the youthful Lord of <mark1>Tryermaine</mark1><br>
Came back upon his heart <mark1>again.</mark1><br>
<br>
O then the Baron forgot his <mark3>age,</mark3><br>
His noble heart swelled high with <mark3>rage;</mark3><br>
He swore by the wounds in Jesu's <mark1>side</mark1><br>
He would proclaim it far and <mark3>wide,</mark3><br>
With trump and solemn <mark4>heraldry,</mark4><br>
That they, who thus had wronged the <mark1>dame,</mark1><br>
Were base as spotted <mark4>infamy!</mark4><br>
'And if they dare deny the <mark1>same,</mark1><br>
My herald shall appoint a <mark4>week,</mark4><br>
And let the recreant traitors <mark3>seek</mark3><br>
My tourney court--that there and <mark3>then</mark3><br>
I may dislodge their reptile <mark4>souls</mark4><br>
From the bodies and forms of <mark3>men!'</mark3><br>
He spake: his eye in lightning <mark3>rolls!</mark3><br>
For the lady was ruthlessly seized; and he kenned <br>
In the beautiful lady the child of his <mark4>friend!</mark4><br>
<br>
And now the tears were on his <mark1>face,</mark1><br>
And fondly in his arms he <mark1>took</mark1><br>
Fair Geraldine, who met the <mark3>embrace,</mark3><br>
Prolonging it with joyous <mark1>look.</mark1><br>
Which when she viewed, a vision <mark1>fell</mark1><br>
Upon the soul of <mark1>Christabel,</mark1><br>
The vision of fear, the touch and <mark1>pain!</mark1><br>
She shrunk and shuddered, and saw <mark1>again--</mark1><br>
(Ah, woe is me! Was it for <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
Thou gentle maid! such sights to <mark1>see?)</mark1><br>
<br>
Again she saw that bosom <mark1>old,</mark1><br>
Again she felt that bosom <mark1>cold,</mark1><br>
And drew in her breath with a hissing <mark4>sound:</mark4><br>
Whereat the Knight turned wildly <mark3>round,</mark3><br>
And nothing saw, but his own sweet <mark4>maid</mark4><br>
With eyes upraised, as one that <mark1>prayed.</mark1><br>
<br>
The touch, the sight, had passed <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
And in its stead that vision <mark1>blest,</mark1><br>
Which comforted her <mark3>after-rest</mark3><br>
While in the lady's arms she <mark3>lay,</mark3><br>
Had put a rapture in her <mark1>breast,</mark1><br>
And on her lips and o'er her <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
Spread smiles like <mark1>light!</mark1><br>
With new <mark3>surprise,</mark3><br>
'What ails then my beloved <mark1>child?</mark1><br>
The Baron said--His daughter <mark1>mild</mark1><br>
Made answer, 'All will yet be <mark1>well!'</mark1><br>
I ween, she had no power to <mark1>tell</mark1><br>
Aught else: so mighty was the <mark1>spell.</mark1><br>
<br>
Yet he, who saw this <mark1>Geraldine,</mark1><br>
Had deemed her sure a thing <mark1>divine:</mark1><br>
Such sorrow with such grace she <mark4>blended,</mark4><br>
As if she feared she had <mark1>offended</mark1><br>
Sweet Christabel, that gentle <mark1>maid!</mark1><br>
And with such lowly tones she <mark1>prayed</mark1><br>
She might be sent without <mark1>delay</mark1><br>
Home to her father's <mark4>mansion.</mark4><br>
<br>
Nay, by my soul!' said <mark1>Leoline.</mark1><br>
'Ho! Bracy the bard, the charge be <mark1>thine!</mark1><br>
Go thou, with sweet music and <mark1>loud,</mark1><br>
And take two steeds with trappings <mark3>proud,</mark3><br>
And take the youth whom thou lov'st <mark4>best</mark4><br>
To bear thy harp, and learn thy <mark4>song,</mark4><br>
And clothe you both in solemn <mark1>vest,</mark1><br>
And over the mountains haste <mark3>along,</mark3><br>
Lest wandering folk, that are <mark4>abroad,</mark4><br>
Detain you on the valley <mark4>road.</mark4><br>
<br>
'And when he has crossed the Irthing <mark4>flood,</mark4><br>
My merry bard! he <mark1>hastes</mark1>, he <mark5>hastes</mark5><br>
Up Knorren Moor, through Halegarth <mark4>Wood,</mark4><br>
And reaches soon that castle <mark3>good</mark3><br>
Which stands and threatens Scotland's <mark4>wastes.</mark4><br>
<br>
'Bard Bracy! bard Bracy! your horses are <mark4>fleet,</mark4><br>
Ye must ride up the hall, your music so <mark1>sweet,</mark1><br>
More loud than your horses' echoing <mark1>feet!</mark1><br>
And loud and loud to Lord Roland <mark1>call,</mark1><br>
Thy daughter is safe in Langdale <mark1>hall!</mark1><br>
Thy beautiful daughter is safe and <mark1>free--</mark1><br>
Sir Leoline greets thee thus through <mark1>me!</mark1><br>
He bids thee come without <mark1>delay</mark1><br>
With all thy numerous <mark3>array</mark3><br>
And take thy lovely daughter <mark4>home:</mark4><br>
And he will meet thee on the <mark1>way</mark1><br>
With all his numerous <mark1>array</mark1><br>
White with their panting palfreys' <mark3>foam:</mark3><br>
And, by mine honour! I will <mark1>say,</mark1><br>
That I repent me of the <mark1>day</mark1><br>
When I spake words of fierce <mark1>disdain</mark1><br>
To Roland de Vaux of <mark1>Tryermaine!--</mark1><br>
--For since that evil hour hath <mark4>flown,</mark4><br>
Many a summer's sun hath <mark1>shone;</mark1><br>
Yet ne'er found I a friend <mark1>again</mark1><br>
Like Roland de Vaux of <mark1>Tryermaine.</mark1><br>
<br>
The lady fell, and clasped his <mark4>knees,</mark4><br>
Her face upraised, her eyes <mark4>o'erflowing;</mark4><br>
And Bracy replied, with faltering <mark4>voice,</mark4><br>
His gracious Hail on all <mark4>bestowing!--</mark4><br>
'Thy words, thou sire of <mark1>Christabel,</mark1><br>
Are sweeter than my harp can <mark1>tell;</mark1><br>
Yet might I gain a boon of <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
This day my journey should not <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
So strange a dream hath come to <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
That I had vowed with music <mark1>loud</mark1><br>
To clear yon wood from thing <mark5>unblest.</mark5><br>
Warned by a vision in my <mark1>rest!</mark1><br>
For in my sleep I saw that <mark3>dove,</mark3><br>
That gentle bird, whom thou dost <mark1>love,</mark1><br>
And call'st by thy own daughter's <mark1>name--</mark1><br>
Sir Leoline! I saw the <mark1>same</mark1><br>
Fluttering, and uttering fearful <mark4>moan,</mark4><br>
Among the green herbs in the forest <mark3>alone.</mark3><br>
Which when I saw and when I <mark4>heard,</mark4><br>
I wonder'd what might ail the <mark3>bird;</mark3><br>
For nothing near it could I <mark1>see</mark1><br>
Save the grass and green herbs underneath the old <mark1>tree.</mark1><br>
<br>
'And in my dream methought I <mark4>went</mark4><br>
To search out what might there be <mark4>found;</mark4><br>
And what the sweet bird's trouble <mark3>meant,</mark3><br>
That thus lay fluttering on the <mark3>ground.</mark3><br>
I went and peered, and could descry <br>
No cause for her distressful <mark3>cry;</mark3><br>
But yet for her dear lady's <mark1>sake</mark1><br>
I stooped, methought, the dove to <mark3>take,</mark3><br>
When lo! I saw a bright green <mark3>snake</mark3><br>
Coiled around its wings and <mark4>neck.</mark4><br>
Green as the herbs on which it <mark4>couched,</mark4><br>
Close by the dove's its head it <mark3>crouched;</mark3><br>
And with the dove it heaves and <mark1>stirs,</mark1><br>
Swelling its neck as she swelled <mark1>hers!</mark1><br>
I woke; it was the midnight <mark1>hour,</mark1><br>
The clock was echoing in the <mark3>tower;</mark3><br>
But though my slumber was gone <mark3>by,</mark3><br>
This dream it would not pass <mark1>away--</mark1><br>
It seems to live upon my <mark1>eye!</mark1><br>
<br>
And thence I vowed this self-same <mark1>day</mark1><br>
With music strong and saintly <mark1>song</mark1><br>
To wander through the forest <mark1>bare,</mark1><br>
Lest aught unholy loiter <mark1>there.'</mark1><br>
<br>
Thus Bracy said: the Baron, the <mark4>while,</mark4><br>
Half-listening heard him with a <mark1>smile;</mark1><br>
Then turned to Lady <mark1>Geraldine,</mark1><br>
His eyes made up of wonder and <mark1>love;</mark1><br>
And said in courtly accents <mark4>fine,</mark4><br>
'Sweet maid, Lord Roland's beauteous <mark1>dove,</mark1><br>
With arms more strong than harp or <mark1>song,</mark1><br>
Thy sire and I will crush the <mark1>snake!'</mark1><br>
He kissed her forehead as he <mark1>spake,</mark1><br>
And Geraldine in maiden <mark4>wise</mark4><br>
Casting down her large bright <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
With blushing cheek and courtesy <mark1>fine</mark1><br>
She turned her from Sir <mark1>Leoline;</mark1><br>
Softly gathering up her <mark4>train,</mark4><br>
That o'er her right arm fell <mark1>again;</mark1><br>
And folded her arms across her <mark4>chest,</mark4><br>
And couched her head upon her <mark1>breast,</mark1><br>
And looked askance at <mark1>Christabel</mark1><br>
Jesu, Maria, shield her <mark1>well!</mark1><br>
<br>
A snake's small eye blinks dull and <mark3>shy;</mark3><br>
And the lady's eyes they shrunk in her <mark4>head,</mark4><br>
Each shrunk up to a serpent's <mark1>eye</mark1><br>
And with somewhat of malice, and more of <mark1>dread,</mark1><br>
At Christabel she looked <mark4>askance!--</mark4><br>
One moment--and the sight was <mark3>fled!</mark3><br>
But Christabel in dizzy <mark1>trance</mark1><br>
Stumbling on the unsteady <mark1>ground</mark1><br>
Shuddered <mark4>aloud</mark4>, with a hissing <mark1>sound;</mark1><br>
And Geraldine again turned <mark1>round,</mark1><br>
And like a thing, that sought <mark3>relief,</mark3><br>
Full of wonder and full of <mark3>grief,</mark3><br>
She rolled her large bright eyes <mark1>divine</mark1><br>
Wildly on Sir <mark1>Leoline.</mark1><br>
<br>
The maid, alas! her thoughts are <mark4>gone,</mark4><br>
She nothing sees--no sight but <mark4>one!</mark4><br>
The maid, devoid of guile and <mark4>sin,</mark4><br>
I know not how, in fearful <mark1>wise,</mark1><br>
So deeply she had drunken <mark1>in</mark1><br>
That look, those shrunken serpent <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
That all her features were <mark4>resigned</mark4><br>
To this sole image in her <mark1>mind:</mark1><br>
And passively did <mark4>imitate</mark4><br>
That look of dull and treacherous <mark4>hate!</mark4><br>
And thus she stood, in dizzy <mark1>trance;</mark1><br>
Still picturing that look <mark1>askance</mark1><br>
With forced unconscious <mark4>sympathy</mark4><br>
Full before her father's <mark1>view--</mark1><br>
As far as such a look could <mark1>be</mark1><br>
In eyes so innocent and <mark1>blue!</mark1><br>
<br>
And when the trance was o'er, the <mark1>maid</mark1><br>
Paused awhile, and inly <mark1>prayed:</mark1><br>
Then falling at the Baron's <mark1>feet,</mark1><br>
'By my mother's soul do I entreat <br>
That thou this woman send <mark1>away!'</mark1><br>
She said: and more she could not <mark1>say:</mark1><br>
For what she knew she could not <mark1>tell,</mark1><br>
O'er-mastered by the mighty <mark1>spell.</mark1><br>
<br>
Why is thy cheek so wan and <mark4>wild,</mark4><br>
Sir Leoline? Thy only <mark1>child</mark1><br>
Lies at thy feet, thy joy, thy <mark1>pride,</mark1><br>
So fair, so innocent, so <mark1>mild;</mark1><br>
The same, for whom thy lady <mark4>died!</mark4><br>
O by the pangs of her dear <mark4>mother</mark4><br>
Think thou no evil of thy <mark1>child!</mark1><br>
For her, and thee, and for no <mark3>other,</mark3><br>
She prayed the moment ere she <mark1>died:</mark1><br>
Prayed that the babe for whom she <mark1>died,</mark1><br>
Might prove her dear lord's joy and <mark1>pride!</mark1><br>
That prayer her deadly pangs <mark4>beguiled,</mark4><br>
Sir <mark1>Leoline!</mark1><br>
And wouldst thou wrong thy only <mark1>child,</mark1><br>
Her child and <mark1>thine?</mark1><br>
<br>
Within the Baron's heart and <mark1>brain</mark1><br>
If thoughts, like these, had any <mark3>share,</mark3><br>
They only swelled his rage and <mark1>pain,</mark1><br>
And did but work confusion <mark1>there.</mark1><br>
His heart was cleft with pain and <mark1>rage,</mark1><br>
His cheeks they quivered, his eyes were <mark1>wild,</mark1><br>
Dishonoured thus in his old <mark1>age;</mark1><br>
Dishonoured by his only <mark1>child,</mark1><br>
And all his <mark4>hospitality</mark4><br>
To the wronged daughter of his <mark1>friend</mark1><br>
By more than woman's <mark4>jealousy</mark4><br>
Brought thus to a disgraceful <mark3>end--</mark3><br>
He rolled his eye with stern <mark4>regard</mark4><br>
Upon the gentle minstrel <mark3>bard,</mark3><br>
And said in tones abrupt, <mark4>austere--</mark4><br>
'Why, Bracy! dost thou loiter <mark1>here?</mark1><br>
I bade thee hence!' The bard <mark4>obeyed;</mark4><br>
And turning from his own sweet <mark1>maid,</mark1><br>
The aged knight, Sir <mark1>Leoline,</mark1><br>
Led forth the lady <mark1>Geraldine!</mark1><br>
<br>
THE CONCLUSION TO PART <mark1>II</mark1><br>
A little child, a limber <mark4>elf,</mark4><br>
Singing, dancing to <mark3>itself,</mark3><br>
A fairy thing with red round <mark4>cheeks,</mark4><br>
That always finds, and never <mark3>seeks,</mark3><br>
Makes such a vision to the <mark4>sight</mark4><br>
As fills a father's eyes with <mark1>light;</mark1><br>
And pleasures flow in so thick and <mark1>fast</mark1><br>
Upon his <mark4>heart</mark4>, that he at <mark3>last</mark3><br>
Must needs express his love's <mark4>excess</mark4><br>
With words of unmeant <mark4>bitterness.</mark4><br>
Perhaps 'tis pretty to force <mark4>together</mark4><br>
Thoughts so all unlike each <mark1>other;</mark1><br>
To mutter and mock a broken <mark4>charm,</mark4><br>
To dally with wrong that does no <mark3>harm.</mark3><br>
Perhaps 'tis tender too and <mark4>pretty</mark4><br>
At each wild word to feel <mark4>within</mark4><br>
A sweet recoil of love and <mark3>pity.</mark3><br>
And what, if in a world of <mark1>sin</mark1><br>
(O sorrow and shame should this be <mark3>true!)</mark3><br>
Such giddiness of heart and <mark1>brain</mark1><br>
Comes seldom save from rage and <mark1>pain,</mark1><br>
So talks as it 's most used to <mark3>do.</mark3><br>
