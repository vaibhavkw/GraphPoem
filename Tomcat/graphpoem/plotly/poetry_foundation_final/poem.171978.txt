Title : The Gaffe <br>
Author : C. K. Williams <br><br>

<br>
If that someone who's me yet not me yet who judges me is always with <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
as he is, shouldn't he have been there when I said so long ago that thing I <mark1>said?</mark1><br>
If he who rakes me with such not trivial shame for minor sins now were there <mark3>then,</mark3><br>
<br>
shouldn't he have warned me he'd even now devastate me for my unpardonable <mark4>affront?</mark4><br>
I'm a child then, yet already I've composed this conscience-beast, who harries <mark1>me:</mark1><br>
<br>
is there anything else I can say with certainty about who I was, except that I, that <mark3>he,</mark3><br>
could already draw from infinitesimal transgressions complex chords of <mark4>remorse,</mark4><br>
<br>
and orchestrate ever undiminishing retribution from the hapless rest of <mark4>myself?</mark4><br>
The son of some friends of my parents has died, and my parents, paying their call,   <br>
<br>
take me along, and I'm sent out with the dead boy's brother and some others to play.   <br>
<br>
We're joking around, and some words come to my <mark4>mind</mark4>, which to my amazement are <mark1>said.</mark1><br>
How do you know when you can laugh when somebody <mark1>dies</mark1>, your brother <mark1>dies?</mark1><br>
<br>
is what's said, and the others go quiet, the backyard goes quiet, everyone <mark4>stares,</mark4><br>
and I want to know now why that someone in me who's me yet not me let me say <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
<br>
Shouldn't he have told me the contrition cycle would from then be ever upon <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
it didn't matter that I'd really only wanted to know how grief ends, and <mark3>when?</mark3><br>
<br>
I could hear the boy's mother sobbing inside, then <mark1>stopping</mark1>, sobbing then <mark1>stopping.</mark1><br>
Was the end of her grief already there? Had her someone in her told her it would <mark4>end?</mark4><br>
<br>
Was her someone in her kinder to her, not tearing at her, as mine did, still does, <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
<br>
for guessing grief someday ends? Is that why her sobbing stopped <mark4>sometimes?</mark4><br>
She didn't laugh, though, or I never heard her. How do you know when you can <mark4>laugh?</mark4><br>
<br>
Why couldn't someone have been there in me not just to accuse me, but to <mark4>explain?</mark4><br>
The kids were playing again, I was playing, I didn't hear anything more from <mark4>inside.</mark4><br>
<br>
The way now sometimes what's in me is silent, too, and sometimes, though never really, <mark4>forgets.</mark4><br>
