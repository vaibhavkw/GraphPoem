Title : The Nymph Complaining for the Death of her Fawn <br>
Author : Andrew Marvell <br><br>

The wanton troopers riding <mark3>by</mark3><br>
Have shot my fawn, and it will <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
Ungentle men! they cannot <mark3>thrive</mark3><br>
To kill thee. Thou ne'er didst <mark3>alive</mark3><br>
Them any harm, alas, nor <mark3>could</mark3><br>
Thy death yet do them any <mark3>good.</mark3><br>
I'm sure I never wish'd them <mark3>ill,</mark3><br>
Nor do I for all this, nor <mark3>will;</mark3><br>
But if my simple pray'rs may <mark3>yet</mark3><br>
Prevail with Heaven to <mark3>forget</mark3><br>
Thy murder, I will join my <mark3>tears</mark3><br>
Rather than fail. But oh, my <mark3>fears!</mark3><br>
It cannot die so. Heaven's <mark4>King</mark4><br>
Keeps register of <mark4>everything,</mark4><br>
And nothing may we use in <mark3>vain.</mark3><br>
Ev'n beasts must be with justice <mark3>slain,</mark3><br>
Else men are made their deodands; <br>
Though they should wash their guilty <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
In this warm life-blood, which doth <mark4>part</mark4><br>
From thine, and wound me to the <mark3>heart,</mark3><br>
Yet could they not be <mark4>clean</mark4>, their <mark3>stain</mark3><br>
Is dyed in such a purple <mark3>grain.</mark3><br>
There is not such another <mark4>in</mark4><br>
The world to offer for their <mark3>sin.</mark3><br>
<br>
Unconstant Sylvio, when <mark1>yet</mark1><br>
I had not found him <mark4>counterfeit</mark4><br>
One morning (I remember <mark4>well)</mark4><br>
Tied in this silver chain and <mark3>bell,</mark3><br>
Gave it to me; nay, and I <mark1>know</mark1><br>
What he said then; I'm sure I <mark3>do.</mark3><br>
Said he, "Look how your huntsman <mark4>here</mark4><br>
Hath taught a fawn to hunt his <mark4>dear."</mark4><br>
But Sylvio soon had me beguil'd, <br>
This waxed tame, while he grew <mark4>wild;</mark4><br>
And quite regardless of my <mark4>smart,</mark4><br>
Left me his fawn, but took his <mark1>heart.</mark1><br>
<br>
Thenceforth I set myself to <mark3>play</mark3><br>
My solitary time <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
With this, and very well <mark4>content</mark4><br>
Could so mine idle life have <mark3>spent;</mark3><br>
For it was full of <mark4>sport</mark4>, and <mark4>light</mark4><br>
Of foot and <mark4>heart</mark4>, and did <mark3>invite</mark3><br>
Me to its game; it seem'd to <mark3>bless</mark3><br>
Itself in me. How could I <mark3>less</mark3><br>
Than love it? Oh, I cannot <mark3>be</mark3><br>
Unkind t' a beast that loveth <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
<br>
Had it liv'd long, I do not <mark1>know</mark1><br>
Whether it too might have done <mark3>so</mark3><br>
As Sylvio did; his gifts might <mark1>be</mark1><br>
Perhaps as false or more than <mark3>he.</mark3><br>
But I am sure, for aught that <mark3>I</mark3><br>
Could in so short a time <mark4>espy,</mark4><br>
Thy love was far more better <mark4>then</mark4><br>
The love of false and cruel <mark3>men.</mark3><br>
<br>
With sweetest milk and sugar <mark4>first</mark4><br>
I it at mine own fingers nurst; <br>
And as it grew, so every <mark3>day</mark3><br>
It wax'd more white and sweet than <mark3>they.</mark3><br>
It had so sweet a breath! And <mark4>oft</mark4><br>
I blush'd to see its foot more <mark3>soft</mark3><br>
And white, shall I say than my <mark4>hand?</mark4><br>
Nay, any lady's of the <mark3>land.</mark3><br>
<br>
It is a wond'rous thing how <mark4>fleet</mark4><br>
'Twas on those little silver <mark3>feet;</mark3><br>
With what a pretty skipping <mark4>grace</mark4><br>
It oft would challenge me the <mark3>race;</mark3><br>
And when 't had left me far <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
'Twould stay, and run again, and <mark3>stay,</mark3><br>
For it was nimbler much than <mark4>hinds,</mark4><br>
And trod, as on the four <mark3>winds.</mark3><br>
<br>
I have a garden of my <mark4>own,</mark4><br>
But so with roses <mark3>overgrown</mark3><br>
And lilies, that you would it <mark4>guess</mark4><br>
To be a little <mark4>wilderness;</mark4><br>
And all the spring time of the <mark3>year</mark3><br>
It only loved to be <mark4>there.</mark4><br>
Among the beds of lilies <mark1>I</mark1><br>
Have sought it oft, where it should <mark3>lie;</mark3><br>
Yet could not, till itself would <mark4>rise,</mark4><br>
Find it, although before mine <mark3>eyes;</mark3><br>
For, in the flaxen lilies' <mark4>shade,</mark4><br>
It like a bank of lilies <mark3>laid.</mark3><br>
Upon the roses it would <mark4>feed</mark4><br>
Until its lips ev'n seemed to <mark3>bleed,</mark3><br>
And then to me 'twould boldly <mark3>trip</mark3><br>
And print those roses on my <mark3>lip.</mark3><br>
But all its chief delight was <mark4>still</mark4><br>
On roses thus itself to <mark3>fill,</mark3><br>
And its pure virgin limbs to <mark4>fold</mark4><br>
In whitest sheets of lilies <mark3>cold.</mark3><br>
Had it liv'd long it would have <mark4>been</mark4><br>
Lilies without, roses <mark3>within.</mark3><br>
<br>
O help, O help! I see it <mark4>faint,</mark4><br>
And die as calmly as a <mark3>saint.</mark3><br>
See how it weeps! The tears do <mark3>come,</mark3><br>
Sad, slowly dropping like a <mark3>gum.</mark3><br>
So weeps the wounded balsam, <mark1>so</mark1><br>
The holy frankincense doth <mark3>flow;</mark3><br>
The brotherless Heliades <br>
Melt in such amber tears as <mark4>these.</mark4><br>
<br>
I in a golden vial <mark1>will</mark1><br>
Keep these two crystal tears, and <mark1>fill</mark1><br>
It till it do o'erflow with <mark4>mine,</mark4><br>
Then place it in Diana's <mark3>shrine.</mark3><br>
<br>
Now my sweet fawn is vanish'd <mark3>to</mark3><br>
Whither the swans and turtles <mark3>go,</mark3><br>
In fair Elysium to <mark4>endure</mark4><br>
With milk-white lambs and ermines <mark3>pure.</mark3><br>
O do not run too fast, for <mark1>I</mark1><br>
Will but bespeak thy grave, and <mark1>die.</mark1><br>
<br>
First my unhappy statue <mark4>shall</mark4><br>
Be cut in marble, and <mark5>withal</mark5><br>
Let it be weeping too; but <mark1>there</mark1><br>
Th' engraver sure his art may <mark3>spare,</mark3><br>
For I so truly thee <mark4>bemoan</mark4><br>
That I shall weep though I be <mark3>stone;</mark3><br>
Until my tears, still dropping, <mark3>wear</mark3><br>
My breast, themselves engraving <mark1>there.</mark1><br>
There at my feet shalt thou be <mark1>laid,</mark1><br>
Of purest alabaster <mark3>made;</mark3><br>
For I would have thine image <mark1>be</mark1><br>
White as I can, though not as <mark3>thee.</mark3><br>
