Title : Old Black Joe <br>
Author : Stephen C. Foster <br><br>

Gone are the days when my heart was young and <mark3>gay,</mark3><br>
Gone are my friends from the cotton fields <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
Gone from the earth to a better land I <mark3>know,</mark3><br>
I hear their gentle voices calling "Old Black <mark3>Joe."</mark3><br>
<br>
I'm coming, I'm coming, for my head is bending <mark3>low:</mark3><br>
I hear those gentle voices calling, "Old Black <mark1>Joe."</mark1><br>
<br>
Why do I weep when my heart should feel no <mark3>pain</mark3><br>
Why do I sigh that my friends come not <mark3>again,</mark3><br>
Grieving for forms Now departed long a <mark3>go?</mark3><br>
I hear their gentle voices calling "Old Black <mark1>Joe."</mark1><br>
<br>
I'm coming, I'm coming, for my head is bending <mark1>low:</mark1><br>
I hear those gentle voices calling, "Old Black <mark1>Joe."</mark1><br>
<br>
Where are the hearts once so happy and so <mark3>free?</mark3><br>
The children so dear that I held upon my <mark3>knee,</mark3><br>
Gone to the shore where my soul has longed to <mark1>go.</mark1><br>
I hear their gentle voices calling "Old Black <mark1>Joe."</mark1><br>
<br>
I'm coming, I'm coming, for my head is bending <mark1>low:</mark1><br>
I hear those gentle voices calling, "Old Black <mark1>Joe."</mark1><br>
