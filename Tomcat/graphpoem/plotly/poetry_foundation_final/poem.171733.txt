Title : The Map <br>
Author : Gary Soto <br><br>

When the sun's whiteness closes around <mark4>us</mark4><br>
Like a <mark4>noose,</mark4><br>
<br>
It is noon, and Molina <mark4>squats</mark4><br>
In the uneven shade of an <mark4>oleander.</mark4><br>
<br>
He unfolds a map and, with a pencil, <br>
Blackens Panama<br>
<br>
Into a <mark4>bruise;</mark4><br>
He dots rain over Bogota, the city of <mark4>spiders,</mark4><br>
<br>
And x's in a mountain range that <mark4>climbs</mark4><br>
Like a <mark4>thermometer</mark4><br>
<br>
Above the stone <mark4>fence</mark4><br>
The old never thought to look <mark4>over.</mark4><br>
<br>
A fog presses over Lima.<br>
Brazil is untangled of its <mark4>rivers.</mark4><br>
<br>
Where there is a smudge,<br>
Snow has stitched its cold into the field.<br>
<br>
Where the river Orinoco cuts east, <br>
A new river rises <mark4>nameless</mark4><br>
<br>
From the open <mark4>grasses,</mark4><br>
And Molina calls it his place of birth.<br>
