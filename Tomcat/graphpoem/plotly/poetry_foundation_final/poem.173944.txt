Title : The Character of Holland <br>
Author : Andrew Marvell <br><br>

<br>
<mark4>Holland</mark4>, that scarce deserves the name of <mark4>land,</mark4><br>
As but th' off-scouring of the British <mark3>sand;</mark3><br>
And so much earth as was <mark4>contributed</mark4><br>
By English pilots when they heav'd the <mark4>lead;</mark4><br>
Or what by th' ocean's slow alluvion <mark3>fell,</mark3><br>
Of shipwrack'd cockle and the <mark3>mussel-shell;</mark3><br>
This indigested vomit of the sea <br>
Fell to the Dutch by just propriety. <br>
<br>
Glad then, as miners that have found the <mark3>ore,</mark3><br>
They with mad labour fish'd the land to <mark3>shore;</mark3><br>
And div'd as desperately for each <mark4>piece</mark4><br>
Of earth, as if't had been of <mark4>ambergris;</mark4><br>
Collecting anxiously small loads of <mark3>clay,</mark3><br>
Less than what building swallows bear <mark3>away;</mark3><br>
Or than those pills which sordid beetles <mark4>roll,</mark4><br>
Transfusing into them their dunghill <mark3>soul.</mark3><br>
<br>
How did they rivet, with gigantic <mark3>piles,</mark3><br>
Thorough the centre their new-catched <mark3>miles;</mark3><br>
And to the stake a struggling country <mark4>bound,</mark4><br>
Where barking waves still bait the forced <mark3>ground;</mark3><br>
Building their watry Babel far more <mark3>high</mark3><br>
To reach the sea, than those to scale the <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
<br>
Yet still his claim the injur'd ocean <mark4>laid,</mark4><br>
And oft at leap-frog ore their steeples <mark4>play'd:</mark4><br>
As if on purpose it on land had come <br>
To show them what's their mare liberum. <br>
A daily deluge over them does <mark4>boil;</mark4><br>
The earth and water play at <mark3>level-coil;</mark3><br>
The fish oft-times the burgher dispossest, <br>
And sat not as a meat but as a guest; <br>
And oft the Tritons and the sea-nymphs saw <br>
Whole sholes of Dutch serv'd up for cabillau; <br>
Or as they over the new level <mark4>rang'd</mark4><br>
For pickled herring, pickled heeren <mark3>chang'd.</mark3><br>
Nature, it seem'd, asham'd of her <mark3>mistake,</mark3><br>
Would throw their land away at duck and <mark3>drake.</mark3><br>
