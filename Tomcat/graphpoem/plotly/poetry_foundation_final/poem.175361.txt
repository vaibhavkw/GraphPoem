Title : Emily Bronte <br>
Author : Louise Imogen Guiney <br><br>

What sacramental hurt that <mark3>brings</mark3><br>
The terror of the truth of <mark3>things</mark3><br>
Had changed thee? Secret be it <mark3>yet.</mark3><br>
'T was thine, upon a headland <mark3>set,</mark3><br>
To view no isles of man's <mark4>delight,</mark4><br>
With lyric foam in rainbow <mark3>flight,</mark3><br>
But all a-swing, a-gleam, mid slow <mark4>uproar,</mark4><br>
Black sea, and curved uncouth sea-bitten <mark4>shore.</mark4><br>
