Title : Agoraphobia <br>
Author : Linda Pastan <br><br>

"Yesterday the bird of night did sit, Even at noon-day, upon the marketplace, Hooting and shrieking."  --William <mark4>Shakespeare</mark4><br>
<br>
Imagine <mark4>waking</mark4><br>
to a scene of snow so <mark3>new</mark3><br>
not even <mark4>memories</mark4><br>
of other snow <br>
can mar its <mark4>silken</mark4><br>
<mark4>surface</mark4>, What other <mark4>innocence</mark4><br>
is quite like <mark4>this,</mark4><br>
and who can blame <mark3>me</mark3><br>
for <mark4>refusing</mark4><br>
to violate such <mark4>whiteness</mark4><br>
with the booted <mark4>cruelty</mark4><br>
of <mark4>tracks?</mark4><br>
Though I cannot leave this <mark4>house,</mark4><br>
<br>
I have memorized the <mark3>view</mark3><br>
<br>
from every <mark1>window--</mark1><br>
23 framed landscapes, <mark4>containing</mark4><br>
each nuance of weather and <mark4>light.</mark4><br>
And I know the <mark4>measure</mark4><br>
of every room, not as a <mark4>prisoner</mark4><br>
pacing a <mark4>cell</mark4><br>
but as the embryo <mark4>knows</mark4><br>
the walls of the womb, <mark3>free</mark3><br>
to swim as its body tells it, to nudge   <br>
the softly fleshed <mark4>walls,</mark4><br>
dreading only the <mark4>moment</mark4><br>
of contraction when it will be <mark4>forced</mark4><br>
into the gaudy <mark4>world.</mark4><br>
Sometimes I travel as <mark4>far</mark4><br>
as the last <mark4>stone</mark4><br>
of the path, <mark4>but</mark4><br>
<br>
every step, <br>
<br>
as in the children's <mark4>story,</mark4><br>
pricks that tender <mark4>place</mark4><br>
on the bottom of the <mark4>foot,</mark4><br>
and like an ebbing tide with <mark4>all</mark4><br>
the obsession of the moon behind <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
I am dragged <mark4>back.</mark4><br>
I have noticed in windy <mark3>fall</mark3><br>
how leaves are torn from the <mark4>trees,</mark4><br>
each leaf waving goodbye to the <mark4>oak</mark4><br>
or the poplar that housed <mark1>it;</mark1><br>
how the moon, <mark4>pinned</mark4><br>
<br>
to the very center of the <mark1>window,</mark1><br>
<br>
is like a moth wanting only to break <mark4>in.</mark4><br>
What I mean is this <mark1>house</mark1><br>
follows all the laws of lintel and ridgepole,   <br>
obeys the commandments of broom   <br>
and of needle, custom and <mark4>grace.</mark4><br>
It is not fear that holds me here but <mark4>passion</mark4><br>
and the uncrossable moat of <mark4>moonlight</mark4><br>
outside the bolted <mark4>doors.</mark4><br>
