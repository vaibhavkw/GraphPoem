Title : Skipper Ireson's Ride <br>
Author : John Greenleaf Whittier <br><br>

Of all the rides since the birth of <mark3>time,</mark3><br>
Told in story or sung in rhyme, <mark3>--</mark3><br>
On Apuleius's Golden <mark3>Ass,</mark3><br>
Or one-eyed Calender's horse of <mark3>brass,</mark3><br>
Witch astride of a human <mark4>back,</mark4><br>
Islam's prophet on Al-Borak, <mark4>--</mark4><br>
The strangest ride that ever was <mark4>sped</mark4><br>
Was Ireson's, out from <mark4>Marblehead!</mark4><br>
Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard <mark3>heart,</mark3><br>
Tarred and feathered and carried in a <mark3>cart</mark3><br>
By the women of <mark1>Marblehead!</mark1><br>
<br>
Body of turkey, head of <mark3>owl,</mark3><br>
Wings a-droop like a rained-on <mark3>fowl,</mark3><br>
Feathered and ruffled in every <mark3>part,</mark3><br>
Skipper Ireson stood in the <mark1>cart.</mark1><br>
Scores of women, old and <mark3>young,</mark3><br>
Strong of muscle, and glib of <mark3>tongue,</mark3><br>
Pushed and pulled up the rocky <mark3>lane,</mark3><br>
Shouting and singing the shrill <mark3>refrain:</mark3><br>
"Here 's Flud Oirson, fur his horrd <mark1>horrt,</mark1><br>
Torr'd an' futherr'd an' corr'd in a <mark1>corrt</mark1><br>
By the women o' <mark1>Morble'ead!"</mark1><br>
<br>
Wrinkled scolds with hands on <mark4>hips,</mark4><br>
Girls in bloom of cheek and <mark3>lips,</mark3><br>
Wild-eyed, free-limbed, such as <mark4>chase</mark4><br>
Bacchus round some antique <mark3>vase,</mark3><br>
Brief of skirt, with ankles <mark3>bare,</mark3><br>
Loose of kerchief and loose of <mark3>hair,</mark3><br>
With conch-shells blowing and fish-horns' <mark4>twang,</mark4><br>
Over and over the Maenads <mark4>sang:</mark4><br>
"Here 's Flud Oirson, fur his horrd <mark1>horrt,</mark1><br>
Torr'd an' futherr'd an' corr'd in a <mark1>corrt</mark1><br>
By the women o' <mark1>Morble'ead!"</mark1><br>
<br>
Small pity for him! -- He sailed <mark3>away</mark3><br>
From a leaking ship in Chaleur Bay, <mark3>--</mark3><br>
Sailed away from a sinking <mark4>wreck,</mark4><br>
With his own town's-people on her <mark3>deck!</mark3><br>
"Lay by! lay by!" they called to <mark4>him.</mark4><br>
Back he answered, "Sink or <mark3>swim!</mark3><br>
Brag of your catch of fish <mark3>again!"</mark3><br>
And off he sailed through the fog and <mark3>rain!</mark3><br>
Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard <mark1>heart,</mark1><br>
Tarred and feathered and carried in a <mark1>cart</mark1><br>
By the women of <mark1>Marblehead!</mark1><br>
<br>
Fathoms deep in dark Chaleur<br>
That wreck shall lie forevermore.<br>
Mother and sister, wife and <mark4>maid,</mark4><br>
Looked from the rocks of <mark1>Marblehead</mark1><br>
Over the moaning and rainy sea, <mark3>--</mark3><br>
Looked for the coming that might not <mark3>be!</mark3><br>
What did the winds and the sea-birds <mark3>say</mark3><br>
Of the cruel captain who sailed away? <mark1>--</mark1><br>
Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard <mark1>heart,</mark1><br>
Tarred and feathered and carried in a <mark1>cart</mark1><br>
By the women of <mark1>Marblehead!</mark1><br>
<br>
Through the street, on either <mark4>side,</mark4><br>
Up flew windows, doors swung <mark3>wide;</mark3><br>
Sharp-tongued spinsters, old wives <mark3>gray,</mark3><br>
Treble lent the fish-horn's <mark3>bray.</mark3><br>
Sea-worn grandsires, <mark4>cripple-bound,</mark4><br>
Hulks of old sailors run <mark3>aground,</mark3><br>
Shook head, and fist, and hat, and <mark3>cane,</mark3><br>
And cracked with curses the hoarse <mark1>refrain:</mark1><br>
"Here's Flud Oirson, fur his horrd <mark1>horrt,</mark1><br>
Torr'd an' futherr'd an' corr'd in a <mark1>corrt</mark1><br>
By the women o' <mark1>Morble'ead!"</mark1><br>
<br>
Sweetly along the Salem <mark4>road</mark4><br>
Bloom of orchard and lilac <mark3>showed.</mark3><br>
Little the wicked skipper <mark3>knew</mark3><br>
Of the fields so green and the sky so <mark3>blue.</mark3><br>
Riding there in his sorry <mark3>trim,</mark3><br>
Like an Indian idol glum and <mark3>grim,</mark3><br>
Scarcely he seemed the sound to <mark4>hear</mark4><br>
Of voices shouting, far and <mark4>near:</mark4><br>
"Here's Flud Oirson, fur his horrd <mark1>horrt,</mark1><br>
Torr'd an' futherr'd an' corr'd in a <mark1>corrt</mark1><br>
By the women o' <mark1>Morble'ead!"</mark1><br>
<br>
"Hear me, neighbors!" at last he cried, <mark4>--</mark4><br>
"What to me is this noisy <mark3>ride?</mark3><br>
What is the shame that clothes the <mark4>skin</mark4><br>
To the nameless horror that lives <mark3>within?</mark3><br>
Waking or sleeping, I see a <mark1>wreck,</mark1><br>
And hear a cry from a reeling <mark1>deck!</mark1><br>
Hate me and curse me, -- I only <mark4>dread</mark4><br>
The hand of God and the face of the <mark3>dead!"</mark3><br>
Said old Floyd Ireson, for his hard <mark1>heart,</mark1><br>
Tarred and feathered and carried in a <mark1>cart</mark1><br>
By the women of <mark1>Marblehead!</mark1><br>
<br>
Then the wife of the skipper lost at <mark1>sea</mark1><br>
Said, "God has touched him! why should <mark3>we!"</mark3><br>
Said an old wife mourning her only <mark4>son,</mark4><br>
"Cut the rogue's tether and let him <mark3>run!"</mark3><br>
So with soft relentings and rude <mark4>excuse,</mark4><br>
Half scorn, half pity, they cut him <mark3>loose,</mark3><br>
And gave him a cloak to hide him <mark4>in,</mark4><br>
And left him alone with his shame and <mark3>sin.</mark3><br>
Poor Floyd Ireson, for his hard <mark1>heart,</mark1><br>
Tarred and feathered and carried in a <mark1>cart</mark1><br>
By the women of <mark1>Marblehead!</mark1><br>
