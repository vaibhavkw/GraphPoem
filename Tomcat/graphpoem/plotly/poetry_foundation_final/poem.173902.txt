Title : The Ladder of St. Augustine <br>
Author : Henry Wadsworth Longfellow <br><br>

Saint Augustine! well hast thou <mark3>said,</mark3><br>
That of our vices we can <mark3>frame</mark3><br>
A ladder, if we will but <mark3>tread</mark3><br>
Beneath our feet each deed of <mark3>shame!</mark3><br>
<br>
All common things, each day's <mark3>events,</mark3><br>
That with the hour begin and <mark4>end,</mark4><br>
Our pleasures and our <mark3>discontents,</mark3><br>
Are rounds by which we may <mark3>ascend.</mark3><br>
<br>
The low desire, the base <mark3>design,</mark3><br>
That makes another's virtues <mark4>less;</mark4><br>
The revel of the ruddy <mark3>wine,</mark3><br>
And all occasions of <mark3>excess;</mark3><br>
<br>
The longing for ignoble <mark3>things;</mark3><br>
The strife for triumph more than <mark3>truth;</mark3><br>
The hardening of the heart, that <mark3>brings</mark3><br>
Irreverence for the dreams of <mark3>youth;</mark3><br>
<br>
All thoughts of ill; all evil <mark4>deeds,</mark4><br>
That have their root in thoughts of <mark3>ill;</mark3><br>
Whatever hinders or <mark3>impedes</mark3><br>
The action of the nobler will; <mark3>--</mark3><br>
<br>
All these must first be trampled <mark4>down</mark4><br>
Beneath our feet, if we would <mark4>gain</mark4><br>
In the bright fields of fair <mark4>renown</mark4><br>
The right of eminent <mark4>domain.</mark4><br>
<br>
We have not wings, we cannot <mark3>soar;</mark3><br>
But we have feet to scale and <mark4>climb</mark4><br>
By slow degrees, by more and <mark3>more,</mark3><br>
The cloudy summits of our <mark3>time.</mark3><br>
<br>
The mighty pyramids of <mark4>stone</mark4><br>
That wedge-like cleave the desert <mark4>airs,</mark4><br>
When nearer <mark4>seen</mark4>, and better <mark3>known,</mark3><br>
Are but gigantic flights of <mark3>stairs.</mark3><br>
<br>
The distant mountains, that uprear <br>
Their solid bastions to the <mark4>skies,</mark4><br>
Are crossed by pathways, that <mark4>appear</mark4><br>
As we to higher levels <mark3>rise.</mark3><br>
<br>
The heights by great men reached and <mark4>kept</mark4><br>
Were not attained by sudden <mark4>flight,</mark4><br>
But they, while their companions <mark4>slept,</mark4><br>
Were toiling upward in the <mark4>night.</mark4><br>
<br>
Standing on what too long we <mark4>bore</mark4><br>
With shoulders bent and downcast <mark3>eyes,</mark3><br>
We may discern -- unseen before <mark3>--</mark3><br>
A path to higher <mark4>destinies,</mark4><br>
<br>
Nor deem the irrevocable <mark4>Past</mark4><br>
As wholly wasted, wholly <mark4>vain,</mark4><br>
If, rising on its wrecks, at <mark3>last</mark3><br>
To something nobler we <mark3>attain.</mark3><br>
