Title : Yellow Dress <br>
Author : Amy Beeder <br><br>

<br>
Girl on a heap of street sweepings high<br>
as a pyre, laid on snarled wire & dented <mark4>rim.</mark4><br>
Girl set down among the wrung-out hides.<br>
A girl who was coming from church. It is <mark4>late</mark4><br>
Sunday afternoon. Was it a seizure? Is <mark4>it</mark4><br>
destiny or bad luck we should fear? Weak <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
or swerving taxi? In Tet Bef by the dirty <mark4>ocean</mark4><br>
thousands crush past her without pausing<br>
at the shrine of her spayed limbs; <mark4>brilliance</mark4><br>
like the flesh of lilies sprouting from the pummeled <mark4>cane.</mark4><br>
Is it possible to be lighthearted, hours <mark5>later?</mark5><br>
Days? To forget the yellow <mark4>dress?</mark4><br>
I am waiting for her mother to find her, still<br>
wearing one white spotless glove (where is the <mark4>other?),</mark4><br>
my idle taxi level with her unbruised <mark4>arm,</mark4><br>
her fingers just curling like petals of a fallen <mark4>flower</mark4><br>
and how did it end? Let someone have gathered her up<br>
before the stars assembled coldly overhead:<br>
her dress brighter than gold, crocus, the yolk of an egg<br>
her face covered like the bride of a god; let <mark4>them</mark4><br>
have found her & borne her though the traffic's <mark4>clamor</mark4><br>
veiled with a stranger's handkerchief.<br>
