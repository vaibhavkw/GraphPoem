Title : For My People<br>
Author : Margaret Walker<br><br>

For my people everywhere singing their slave <mark4>songs</mark4><br>
repeatedly: their dirges and their ditties and their <mark4>blues</mark4><br>
and jubilees, praying their prayers nightly to <mark1>an</mark1><br>
unknown god, bending their knees humbly to <mark1>an</mark1><br>
unseen <mark4>power;</mark4><br>
<br>
For my people lending their strength to the years, to <mark4>the</mark4><br>
gone years and the now years and the maybe <mark4>years,</mark4><br>
washing ironing cooking scrubbing sewing <mark4>mending</mark4><br>
hoeing plowing digging planting pruning <mark4>patching</mark4><br>
dragging along never gaining never reaping <mark4>never</mark4><br>
knowing and never <mark4>understanding;</mark4><br>
<br>
For my playmates in the clay and dust and sand of <mark4>Alabama</mark4><br>
backyards playing baptizing and preaching and <mark4>doctor</mark4><br>
and jail and soldier and school and mama and <mark4>cooking</mark4><br>
and playhouse and concert and store and hair <mark4>and</mark4><br>
Miss Choomby and <mark3>company;</mark3><br>
<br>
For the cramped bewildered years we went to school to <mark4>learn</mark4><br>
to know the reasons why and the answers to and <mark1>the</mark1><br>
people who and the places where and the days <mark3>when</mark3>, <mark4>in</mark4><br>
    memory of the bitter hours when we discovered we <br>
were black and poor and small and different and <mark4>nobody</mark4><br>
cared and nobody wondered and nobody <mark4>understood;</mark4><br>
<br>
For the boys and girls who grew in spite of these things <mark4>to</mark4><br>
be man and woman, to laugh and dance and sing <mark1>and</mark1><br>
play and drink their wine and religion and success, <mark1>to</mark1><br>
marry their playmates and bear children and then <mark3>die</mark3><br>
of consumption and anemia and <mark4>lynching;</mark4><br>
<br>
For my people thronging 47th Street in Chicago and Lenox <br>
Avenue in New York and Rampart Street in <mark3>New</mark3><br>
Orleans, lost disinherited dispossessed and <mark4>happy</mark4><br>
people filling the cabarets and taverns and <mark4>other</mark4><br>
people's pockets and needing bread and shoes and milk <mark1>and</mark1><br>
land and money and something--something all our <mark4>own;</mark4><br>
<br>
For my people walking blindly spreading joy, losing time <br>
being lazy, sleeping when hungry, shouting <mark4>when</mark4><br>
burdened, drinking when hopeless, <mark4>tied</mark4>, and <mark4>shackled</mark4><br>
and tangled among ourselves by the unseen <mark4>creatures</mark4><br>
     who tower over us omnisciently and laugh;<br>
<br>
For my people blundering and groping and floundering <mark1>in</mark1><br>
the dark of churches and schools and <mark4>clubs</mark4><br>
and societies, associations and councils and committees <mark1>and</mark1><br>
conventions, distressed and disturbed and deceived <mark1>and</mark1><br>
devoured by money-hungry glory-craving <mark4>leeches,</mark4><br>
preyed on by facile force of state and fad and novelty, <mark3>by</mark3><br>
false prophet and holy <mark4>believer;</mark4><br>
<br>
For my people standing staring trying to fashion a better <mark3>way</mark3><br>
from confusion, from hypocrisy and <mark4>misunderstanding,</mark4><br>
trying to fashion a world that will hold all the <mark1>people,</mark1><br>
all the <mark4>faces</mark4>, all the adams and eves and their countless <mark4>generations;</mark4><br>
<br>
Let a new earth rise. Let another world be born. Let <mark3>a</mark3><br>
bloody peace be written in the sky. Let a <mark3>second</mark3><br>
generation full of courage issue forth; let a <mark1>people</mark1><br>
    loving freedom come to growth. Let a beauty full of <br>
healing and a strength of final clenching be the <mark4>pulsing</mark4><br>
in our spirits and our blood. Let the martial <mark1>songs</mark1><br>
    be written, let the dirges disappear. Let a race of men now <br>
rise and take <mark4>control.</mark4><br>
