Title : Lines for a Prologue <br>
Author : Archibald MacLeish <br><br>

These alternate nights and <mark4>days</mark4>, these <mark4>seasons</mark4><br>
Somehow fail to convince me. It <mark4>seems</mark4><br>
I have the sense of <mark1>infinity!</mark1><br>
<br>
(In your dreams, O crew of <mark4>Columbus,</mark4><br>
O listeners over the <mark5>sea</mark5><br>
For the surf that breaks upon <mark4>Nothing--)</mark4><br>
<br>
Once I was waked by the nightingales in the garden.   <br>
I <mark1>thought</mark1>, What time is it? I <mark1>thought,</mark1><br>
Time--Is it Time still?--Now is it <mark3>Time?</mark3><br>
<br>
(Tell me your <mark4>dreams</mark4>, O <mark4>sailors:</mark4><br>
Tell me, in sleep did you <mark3>climb</mark3><br>
The tall masts, and before you--) <br>
<br>
At night the stillness of old <mark4>trees</mark4><br>
Is a leaning over and the <mark4>inertness</mark4><br>
Of hills is a kind of <mark4>waiting.</mark4><br>
<br>
(In sleep, in a dream, did you <mark2>see</mark2><br>
The world's end? Did the water <br>
Break--and no shore--Did you <mark1>see?)</mark1><br>
<br>
Strange faces come through the streets to <mark3>me</mark3><br>
Like messengers: and I have been <mark4>warned</mark4><br>
By the moving slowly of hands at a window. <br>
<br>
Oh, I have the sense of <mark1>infinity--</mark1><br>
But the world, sailors, is <mark4>round.</mark4><br>
They say there is no end to <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
