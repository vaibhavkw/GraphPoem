Title : The Militance of a Photograph in the Passbook of a Bantu under Detention <br>
Author : Michael S. Harper <br><br>

Peace is the active presence of <mark4>Justice.</mark4><br>
The wrinkles on the brown <mark4>face</mark4><br>
of the carrying <mark3>case</mark3><br>
conform to the <mark4>buttocks,</mark4><br>
on which the streaks of <mark4>water</mark4><br>
from a five-gallon <mark4>can</mark4><br>
dribble on the tailfront <br>
of the borrowed <mark4>shirt</mark4><br>
he would wear if he <mark4>could</mark4><br>
drain the pus from his swaddling   <br>
bandages, striations of <mark4>skin</mark4><br>
tunneling into the <mark1>photograph.</mark1><br>
<br>
This is no simple mug <mark4>shot</mark4><br>
of a runaway boy in a <mark4>training</mark4><br>
film, Soweto's pummeled <mark4>wire,</mark4><br>
though the turrets of <mark4>light</mark4><br>
glisten in smoke, the <mark4>soft</mark4><br>
coal hooding his <mark4>platform</mark4><br>
entrance, dull and <mark4>quiet.</mark4><br>
<br>
His father's miner's <mark5>shoes</mark5><br>
stand in puddles of <mark4>polish,</mark4><br>
the black soot <mark4>baked</mark4><br>
into images of brittle torso,   <br>
an inferno of bullets <mark4>laid</mark4><br>
out in a letter <mark4>bomb,</mark4><br>
the frontispiece of one <mark4>sergeant-</mark4><br>
major blackening his <mark4>mustache.</mark4><br>
<br>
On the drive to <mark1>Evaton</mark1><br>
a blank pass away from <mark5>Sharpeville</mark5><br>
where the freehold <mark4>morgans</mark4><br>
were bought by a black bishop <br>
from Ontario, Canada, on a <mark4>trek</mark4><br>
northward from the Cape in 1908, <br>
I speak to myself as the <mark4>woman</mark4><br>
riding in the backseat <mark4>talks</mark4><br>
of this day, her <mark4>husband's</mark4><br>
death, twenty-three years ago, <br>
run over by an Afrikaner in the <mark4>wrong</mark4><br>
passing lane; the passbook on the <mark4>shoulder</mark4><br>
of the road leading to <mark1>Evaton</mark1><br>
is not the one I have in my <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
and the photograph is not of my <mark4>great-</mark4><br>
grandfather, who set sail for <mark4>Philadelphia</mark4><br>
in the war year of 1916. <br>
He did not want a reception, his <mark4>letters</mark4><br>
embarking on a platform at Queenstown   <br>
where his eloquence struck two Zulu <mark4>warriors</mark4><br>
pledged to die in the <mark4>homelands</mark4><br>
because they could not spin their own <mark4>gold.</mark4><br>
<br>
These threaded heads weigh down the <mark4>ears</mark4><br>
in design of the warrior, <mark4>Shaka,</mark4><br>
indifferent to the ruthless <mark4>offerings</mark4><br>
over the dead bodies of his <mark4>wives,</mark4><br>
childless in the campaigns with the <mark4>British,</mark4><br>
who sit on the ships of the Indian <mark4>Ocean</mark4><br>
each kraal shuddering near the <mark4>borders;</mark4><br>
<br>
her lips turn in <mark4>profile</mark4><br>
to the dust rising over a <mark4>road</mark4><br>
where his house once <mark4>stood;</mark4><br>
one could think of the <mark4>women</mark4><br>
carrying firewood as an <mark4>etching</mark4><br>
in remembrance to the <mark4>silence,</mark4><br>
commencing at <mark1>Sharpeville,</mark1><br>
but this is Evaton, where he would <mark4>come</mark4><br>
from across the galleyship of <mark4>spears</mark4><br>
turning in his robes to a <mark4>bookmark;</mark4><br>
it is a good book, the picture of <mark4>words</mark4><br>
in the gloss of a <mark1>photograph,</mark1><br>
the burned image of the man who <mark4>wears</mark4><br>
this image on the tongue of a <mark4>child,</mark4><br>
who might hold my <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
as we walk in late <mark4>afternoon</mark4><br>
into the predestined <mark4>sun.</mark4><br>
<br>
The press of wrinkles on the <mark4>blanketed</mark4><br>
voice of the man who took the <mark4>train</mark4><br>
from Johannesburg <br>
is flattened in Cape <mark4>Town,</mark4><br>
and the history of this <mark4>book</mark4><br>
is on a trestle where <mark4>Gandhi</mark4><br>
worshipped in <mark4>Natal,</mark4><br>
and the Zulu lullaby <br>
I cannot sing in Bantu <br>
is this song in the <mark4>body</mark4><br>
of a <mark4>passbook</mark4><br>
and the book <mark4>passes</mark4><br>
into a <mark1>shirt</mark1><br>
and the back that wears <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
