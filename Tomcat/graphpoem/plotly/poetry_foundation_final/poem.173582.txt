Title : Only a Dad <br>
Author : Edgar Albert Guest <br><br>

Only a dad, with a tired <mark3>face,</mark3><br>
Coming home from the daily <mark3>race,</mark3><br>
Bringing little of gold or <mark3>fame,</mark3><br>
To show how well he has played the <mark3>game,</mark3><br>
But glad in his heart that his own <mark4>rejoice</mark4><br>
To see him come, and to hear his <mark3>voice.</mark3><br>
<br>
Only a dad, with a brood of <mark3>four,</mark3><br>
One of ten million men or <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
Plodding along in the daily <mark3>strife,</mark3><br>
Bearing the whips and the scorns of <mark3>life,</mark3><br>
With never a whimper of pain or <mark3>hate,</mark3><br>
For the sake of those who at home <mark3>await.</mark3><br>
<br>
Only a <mark4>dad</mark4>, neither rich nor <mark4>proud,</mark4><br>
Merely one of the surging <mark3>crowd</mark3><br>
Toiling, striving from day to <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
Facing whatever may come his <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
Silent, whenever the harsh <mark4>condemn,</mark4><br>
And bearing it all for the love of <mark3>them.</mark3><br>
<br>
Only a dad, but he gives his <mark3>all</mark3><br>
To smooth the way for his children <mark3>small,</mark3><br>
Doing, with courage stern and <mark4>grim,</mark4><br>
The deeds that his father did for <mark3>him.</mark3><br>
This is the line that for him I <mark3>pen,</mark3><br>
Only a dad, but the best of <mark3>men.</mark3><br>
