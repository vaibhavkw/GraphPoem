Title : Astrophil and Stella 31: With how sad steps, O Moon, thou climb'st the skies <br>
Author : Sir Philip Sidney <br><br>

With how sad steps, O Moon, thou climb'st the <mark3>skies!</mark3><br>
How silently, and with how wan a <mark3>face!</mark3><br>
What, may it be that even in heav'nly <mark3>place</mark3><br>
That busy archer his sharp arrows <mark3>tries!</mark3><br>
Sure, if that long-with love-acquainted <mark3>eyes</mark3><br>
Can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's <mark3>case,</mark3><br>
I read it in thy <mark4>looks</mark4>, thy languish'd <mark3>grace</mark3><br>
To me, that feel the like, thy state descries. <br>
Then, ev'n of fellowship, O Moon, tell <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
Is constant love deem'd there but want of <mark4>wit?</mark4><br>
Are beauties there as proud as here they <mark3>be?</mark3><br>
Do they above love to be lov'd, and <mark4>yet</mark4><br>
Those lovers scorn whom that love doth <mark4>possess?</mark4><br>
Do they call virtue there ungratefulness?<br>
