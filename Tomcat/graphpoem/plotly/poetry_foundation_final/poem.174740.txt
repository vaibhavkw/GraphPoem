Title : I Sing the Body Electric <br>
Author : Walt Whitman <br><br>

<br>
I sing the body <mark4>electric,</mark4><br>
The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
They will not let me off till I go with <mark1>them</mark1>, respond to <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the <mark1>soul.</mark1><br>
<br>
Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal <mark5>themselves?</mark5><br>
And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the <mark4>dead?</mark4><br>
And if the body does not do fully as much as the <mark1>soul?</mark1><br>
And if the body were not the <mark1>soul</mark1>, what is the <mark1>soul?</mark1><br>
<br>
The love of the body of man or woman balks <mark1>account</mark1>, the body itself balks <mark1>account,</mark1><br>
That of the male is <mark1>perfect</mark1>, and that of the female is <mark4>perfect.</mark4><br>
The expression of the face balks <mark1>account,</mark1><br>
<br>
But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his <mark4>face,</mark4><br>
It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and <mark4>wrists,</mark4><br>
It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees, dress does not hide <mark4>him,</mark4><br>
The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth, <br>
To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps <mark4>more,</mark4><br>
You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and <mark4>shoulder-side.</mark4><br>
The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape <mark4>downwards,</mark4><br>
<br>
The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls silently to and fro in the heave of the <mark4>water,</mark4><br>
The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the horseman in his <mark4>saddle,</mark4><br>
Girls, mothers, <mark4>house-keepers</mark4>, in all their <mark4>performances,</mark4><br>
The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives <mark5>waiting,</mark5><br>
The female soothing a <mark4>child</mark4>, the farmer's daughter in the garden or <mark4>cow-yard,</mark4><br>
The young fellow hoeing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his six horses through the <mark4>crowd,</mark4><br>
The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sun-down after <mark4>work,</mark4><br>
The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and <mark4>resistance,</mark4><br>
The upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the <mark4>eyes;</mark4><br>
The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through clean-setting trowsers and <mark4>waist-straps,</mark4><br>
The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the listening on the <mark4>alert,</mark4><br>
The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curv'd neck and the <mark4>counting;</mark4><br>
Such-like I love--I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother's breast with the little <mark4>child,</mark4><br>
Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, <mark4>count.</mark4><br>
I knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five <mark4>sons,</mark4><br>
<br>
And in them the fathers of <mark1>sons</mark1>, and in them the fathers of <mark1>sons.</mark1><br>
This man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of <mark5>person,</mark5><br>
The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black <mark4>eyes</mark4>, the richness and breadth of his <mark4>manners,</mark4><br>
<br>
These I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also, <br>
He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, <mark4>handsome,</mark4><br>
They and his daughters loved <mark1>him</mark1>, all who saw him loved <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
They did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
He drank water only, the blood show'd like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his <mark1>face,</mark1><br>
He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail'd his boat himself, he had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the <mark4>gang,</mark4><br>
You would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to sit by him in the boat that you and he might touch each <mark4>other.</mark4><br>
I have perceiv'd that to be with those I like is <mark1>enough,</mark1><br>
To stop in company with the rest at evening is <mark1>enough,</mark1><br>
<br>
To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is <mark1>enough,</mark1><br>
To pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment, what is this <mark4>then?</mark4><br>
I do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in a <mark2>sea.</mark2><br>
There is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul <mark4>well,</mark4><br>
All things please the <mark4>soul</mark4>, but these please the soul <mark1>well.</mark1><br>
This is the female <mark4>form,</mark4><br>
<br>
A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to <mark4>foot,</mark4><br>
It attracts with fierce undeniable <mark4>attraction,</mark4><br>
<br>
I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor, all falls aside but myself and <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what was expected of heaven or fear'd of hell, are now <mark4>consumed,</mark4><br>
Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response likewise <mark4>ungovernable,</mark4><br>
Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all <mark1>diffused</mark1>, mine too <mark4>diffused,</mark4><br>
Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling and deliciously <mark4>aching,</mark4><br>
Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and delirious <mark4>juice,</mark4><br>
Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate <mark4>dawn,</mark4><br>
Undulating into the willing and yielding <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh'd <mark1>day.</mark1><br>
This the nucleus--after the child is born of <mark1>woman</mark1>, man is born of <mark4>woman,</mark4><br>
This the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the outlet <mark4>again.</mark4><br>
Be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the <mark1>rest</mark1>, and is the exit of the <mark4>rest,</mark4><br>
You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the <mark1>soul.</mark1><br>
<br>
The female contains all qualities and tempers <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
She is in her place and moves with perfect <mark4>balance,</mark4><br>
<br>
She is all things duly veil'd, she is both passive and <mark4>active,</mark4><br>
She is to conceive daughters as well as <mark4>sons</mark4>, and sons as well as <mark4>daughters.</mark4><br>
<br>
As I see my soul reflected in <mark4>Nature,</mark4><br>
As I see through a mist, One with inexpressible completeness, <mark4>sanity</mark4>, <mark4>beauty,</mark4><br>
See the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the Female I <mark2>see.</mark2><br>
The male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his <mark4>place,</mark4><br>
<br>
He too is all qualities, he is action and <mark4>power,</mark4><br>
The flush of the known universe is in <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
Scorn becomes him <mark1>well</mark1>, and appetite and defiance become him <mark1>well,</mark1><br>
<br>
The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost become him well, pride is for <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the <mark1>soul,</mark1><br>
Knowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing to the test of <mark4>himself,</mark4><br>
Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail he strikes soundings at last only <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
(Where else does he strike soundings except <mark1>here?)</mark1><br>
The man's body is sacred and the woman's body is <mark4>sacred,</mark4><br>
No matter who it is, it is sacred--is it the meanest one in the laborers' <mark1>gang?</mark1><br>
Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the <mark4>wharf?</mark4><br>
Each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well-off, just as much as <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
Each has his or her place in the <mark4>procession.</mark4><br>
<br>
(All is a <mark1>procession,</mark1><br>
The universe is a procession with measured and perfect <mark4>motion.)</mark4><br>
Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest <mark4>ignorant?</mark4><br>
Do you suppose you have a right to a good <mark1>sight</mark1>, and he or she has no right to a <mark4>sight?</mark4><br>
Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and the soil is on the <mark4>surface</mark4>, and water runs and vegetation <mark4>sprouts,</mark4><br>
<br>
For you only, and not for him and <mark5>her?</mark5><br>
A man's body at <mark4>auction,</mark4><br>
<br>
(For before the war I often go to the slave-mart and watch the <mark4>sale,)</mark4><br>
I help the auctioneer, the sloven does not half know his <mark4>business.</mark4><br>
Gentlemen look on this <mark4>wonder,</mark4><br>
Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
<br>
For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one animal or <mark4>plant,</mark4><br>
For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily <mark4>roll'd.</mark4><br>
In this head the all-baffling <mark4>brain,</mark4><br>
In it and below it the makings of <mark4>heroes.</mark4><br>
<br>
Examine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in tendon and <mark4>nerve,</mark4><br>
They shall be stript that you may see <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, <mark4>volition,</mark4><br>
Flakes of breast-muscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby, good-sized arms and <mark4>legs,</mark4><br>
<br>
And wonders within there <mark4>yet.</mark4><br>
Within there runs <mark4>blood,</mark4><br>
<br>
The same old blood! the same red-running <mark1>blood!</mark1><br>
There swells and jets a heart, there all passions, desires, reachings, <mark4>aspirations,</mark4><br>
<br>
(Do you think they are not there because they are not express'd in parlors and <mark4>lecture-rooms?)</mark4><br>
This is not only one man, this the father of those who shall be fathers in their <mark4>turns,</mark4><br>
In him the start of populous states and rich <mark4>republics,</mark4><br>
<br>
Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and <mark4>enjoyments.</mark4><br>
How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the <mark4>centuries?</mark4><br>
(Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace back through the <mark1>centuries?)</mark1><br>
A woman's body at <mark1>auction,</mark1><br>
<br>
She too is not only herself, she is the teeming mother of <mark4>mothers,</mark4><br>
She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the <mark1>mothers.</mark1><br>
Have you ever loved the body of a <mark1>woman?</mark1><br>
<br>
Have you ever loved the body of a <mark4>man?</mark4><br>
Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all nations and times all over the <mark4>earth?</mark4><br>
<br>
If any thing is sacred the human body is <mark1>sacred,</mark1><br>
And the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood <mark4>untainted,</mark4><br>
And in man or woman a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is more beautiful than the most beautiful <mark1>face.</mark1><br>
Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool that corrupted her own live <mark4>body?</mark4><br>
<br>
For they do not conceal <mark1>themselves</mark1>, and cannot conceal <mark1>themselves.</mark1><br>
O my body! I dare not desert the likes of you in other men and women, nor the likes of the parts of <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of the <mark1>soul</mark1>, (and that they are the <mark1>soul,)</mark1><br>
<br>
I believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my <mark1>poems</mark1>, and that they are my <mark4>poems,</mark4><br>
Man's, <mark4>woman's</mark4>, child's, youth's, wife's, husband's, mother's, father's, young man's, young woman's <mark1>poems,</mark1><br>
Head, neck, hair, <mark1>ears</mark1>, drop and tympan of the <mark4>ears,</mark4><br>
<br>
Eyes, eye-fringes, iris of the eye, <mark4>eyebrows</mark4>, and the waking or sleeping of the <mark4>lids,</mark4><br>
Mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, <mark4>jaws</mark4>, and the <mark4>jaw-hinges,</mark4><br>
<br>
Nose, nostrils of the nose, and the <mark4>partition,</mark4><br>
Cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the neck, neck-slue, <br>
Strong shoulders, manly beard, scapula, hind-shoulders, and the ample side-round of the <mark4>chest,</mark4><br>
Upper-arm, armpit, elbow-socket, lower-arm, arm-sinews, <mark4>arm-bones,</mark4><br>
Wrist and wrist-joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, forefinger, finger-joints, <mark4>finger-nails,</mark4><br>
Broad breast-front, curling hair of the breast, breast-bone, <mark4>breast-side,</mark4><br>
Ribs, belly, <mark1>backbone</mark1>, joints of the <mark4>backbone,</mark4><br>
Hips, hip-sockets, hip-strength, inward and outward round, man-balls, <mark4>man-root,</mark4><br>
Strong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk <mark4>above,</mark4><br>
Leg fibres, knee, knee-pan, <mark3>upper-leg</mark3>, <mark3>under-leg,</mark3><br>
Ankles, instep, foot-ball, toes, toe-joints, the <mark4>heel;</mark4><br>
All attitudes, all the shapeliness, all the belongings of my or your body or of any one's body, male or <mark4>female,</mark4><br>
The lung-sponges, the stomach-sac, the bowels sweet and <mark4>clean,</mark4><br>
The brain in its folds inside the <mark4>skull-frame,</mark4><br>
Sympathies, heart-valves, palate-valves, <mark4>sexuality</mark4>, <mark4>maternity,</mark4><br>
Womanhood, and all that is a <mark1>woman</mark1>, and the man that comes from <mark1>woman,</mark1><br>
The womb, the teats, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping, love-looks, love-perturbations and risings, <br>
The voice, articulation, language, whispering, shouting <mark4>aloud,</mark4><br>
Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep, <mark4>walking</mark4>, <mark4>swimming,</mark4><br>
Poise on the hips, leaping, reclining, <mark4>embracing</mark4>, arm-curving and <mark4>tightening,</mark4><br>
The continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and around the <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
The skin, the sunburnt shade, freckles, <mark4>hair,</mark4><br>
The curious sympathy one feels when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the <mark1>body,</mark1><br>
The circling rivers the breath, and breathing it in and <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the <mark4>knees,</mark4><br>
The thin red jellies within you or within me, the bones and the marrow in the <mark4>bones,</mark4><br>
The exquisite realization of <mark4>health;</mark4><br>
O I say these are not the parts and poems of the body only, but of the <mark1>soul,</mark1><br>
O I say now these are the <mark1>soul!</mark1><br>
