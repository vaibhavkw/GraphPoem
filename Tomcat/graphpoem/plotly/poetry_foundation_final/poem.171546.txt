Title : Vandergast and the Girl <br>
Author : Louis Simpson <br><br>

Vandergast to his <mark4>neighbors--</mark4><br>
the grinding of a garage <mark4>door</mark4><br>
and hiss of gravel in the driveway. <br>
<br>
He worked for the insurance <mark3>company</mark3><br>
whose talisman is a <mark4>phoenix</mark4><br>
rising in flames ... non omnis moriar. <br>
From his desk he had a view of the <mark4>street--</mark4><br>
<br>
translucent raincoats, and <mark4>umbrellas,</mark4><br>
fluorescent plate-glass <mark4>windows.</mark4><br>
A girl knelt down, <mark4>arranging</mark4><br>
underwear on a female <mark4>dummy--</mark4><br>
<br>
sea waves and, on the <mark4>gale,</mark4><br>
Venus, these busy <mark4>days,</mark4><br>
poised in her garter belt and <mark4>stockings.</mark4><br>
<br>
The next day he saw her <mark4>eating</mark4><br>
<br>
in the restaurant where he usually <mark4>ate.</mark4><br>
Soon they were having lunch <mark4>together</mark4><br>
<br>
She came from <mark4>Dallas.</mark4><br>
<br>
This was only a start, she was <mark4>ambitious,</mark4><br>
twenty-five and still <mark4>unmarried.</mark4><br>
Green eyes with silver spiricles ... <br>
red hair <mark4>...</mark4><br>
When he held the car door <mark4>open</mark4><br>
her legs were smooth and <mark4>slender.</mark4><br>
"I was <mark4>wondering,"</mark4><br>
<br>
she said, "when you'd get round to <mark4>it,"</mark4><br>
and <mark4>laughed.</mark4><br>
Vandergast says he never <mark4>intended</mark4><br>
<br>
having an <mark3>affair.</mark3><br>
<br>
And was that what this <mark4>was?</mark4><br>
The names that people give to things <mark4>...</mark4><br>
What do definitions and divorce-court <mark4>proceedings</mark4><br>
have to do with the breathless <mark3>reality?</mark3><br>
O little lamp at the <mark4>bedside</mark4><br>
with views of Venice and the Bay of <mark4>Naples,</mark4><br>
<br>
you understood! Lactona toothbrush <br>
and suitcase bought in a <mark4>hurry,</mark4><br>
you were the witnesses of the love <br>
we made in bed <mark1>together.</mark1><br>
Schrafft's Chocolate Cherries, surely you <mark4>remember</mark4><br>
when she said she'd be true <mark4>forever,</mark4><br>
<br>
and, watching "Dark Storm," we <mark4>decided</mark4><br>
there is something to be said, after <mark4>all,</mark4><br>
<br>
for soap opera, "if it makes people <mark4>happy."</mark4><br>
The Vandergasts are having some <mark4>trouble</mark4><br>
finding a buyer for their <mark4>house.</mark4><br>
<br>
When I go for a walk with <mark4>Tippy</mark4><br>
<br>
I pass the unweeded tennis <mark4>court,</mark4><br>
the empty garage, windows heavily <mark4>shuttered.</mark4><br>
<br>
Mrs. Vandergast took the <mark4>children</mark4><br>
and went back to her <mark4>family.</mark4><br>
And Vandergast moved to New <mark4>Jersey,</mark4><br>
<br>
where he works for an insurance <mark1>company</mark1><br>
whose emblem is the Rock of <mark4>Gibraltar--</mark4><br>
<br>
the rest of his life laid <mark4>out</mark4><br>
with the child-support and alimony <mark4>payments.</mark4><br>
As for the girl, she <mark4>vanished.</mark4><br>
Was it worth it? Ask Vandergast. <br>
You'd have to be Vandergast, looking through his <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
<br>
at the house across the street, in Orange, New <mark1>Jersey.</mark1><br>
<br>
Maybe on wet days umbrellas and <mark4>raincoats</mark4><br>
set his heart thudding. <br>
he talks to his pillow, and it <mark4>whispers,</mark4><br>
moving red <mark1>hair.</mark1><br>
In any case, he will soon be <mark4>forty.</mark4><br>
