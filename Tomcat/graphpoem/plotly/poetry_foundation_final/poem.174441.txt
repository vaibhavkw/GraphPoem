Title : A Song to David <br>
Author : Christopher Smart <br><br>

<br>
   Sweet is the dew that falls betimes,<br>
And drops upon the leafy <mark4>limes;</mark4><br>
Sweet Hermon's fragrant <mark1>air:</mark1><br>
Sweet is the lily's silver <mark3>bell,</mark3><br>
And sweet the wakeful tapers <mark3>smell</mark3><br>
That watch for early <mark4>pray'r.</mark4><br>
<br>
Sweet the young nurse with love <mark4>intense,</mark4><br>
Which smiles o'er sleeping <mark4>innocence;</mark4><br>
Sweet when the lost <mark3>arrive:</mark3><br>
Sweet the musician's ardour <mark4>beats,</mark4><br>
While his vague mind's in quest of <mark3>sweets,</mark3><br>
The choicest flow'rs to <mark3>hive.</mark3><br>
<br>
Sweeter in all the strains of <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
The language of thy turtle <mark3>dove,</mark3><br>
Pair'd to thy swelling <mark4>chord;</mark4><br>
Sweeter with ev'ry grace endu'd,<br>
The glory of thy <mark4>gratitude,</mark4><br>
Respir'd unto the <mark4>Lord.</mark4><br>
<br>
Strong is the horse upon his <mark4>speed;</mark4><br>
Strong in pursuit the rapid glede,<br>
Which makes at once his <mark3>game:</mark3><br>
Strong the tall ostrich on the <mark4>ground;</mark4><br>
Strong thro' the turbulent <mark3>profound</mark3><br>
Shoots xiphias to his <mark3>aim.</mark3><br>
<br>
Strong is the lion--like a <mark4>coal</mark4><br>
His eye-ball--like a bastion's <mark3>mole</mark3><br>
His chest against the <mark4>foes:</mark4><br>
Strong, the gier-eagle on his <mark4>sail,</mark4><br>
Strong against tide, th' enormous <mark3>whale</mark3><br>
Emerges as he <mark3>goes.</mark3><br>
<br>
But stronger still, in earth and <mark1>air,</mark1><br>
And in the sea, the man of <mark1>pray'r;</mark1><br>
And far beneath the <mark4>tide;</mark4><br>
And in the seat to faith <mark4>assign'd,</mark4><br>
Where ask is have, where seek is <mark4>find,</mark4><br>
Where knock is open <mark4>wide.</mark4><br>
<br>
Beauteous the fleet before the <mark3>gale;</mark3><br>
Beauteous the multitudes in <mark3>mail,</mark3><br>
Rank'd arms and crested <mark4>heads:</mark4><br>
Beauteous the garden's umbrage <mark4>mild,</mark4><br>
Walk, water, meditated <mark3>wild,</mark3><br>
And all the bloomy <mark3>beds.</mark3><br>
<br>
Beauteous the moon full on the <mark3>lawn;</mark3><br>
And beauteous, when the veil's <mark3>withdrawn,</mark3><br>
The virgin to her <mark4>spouse:</mark4><br>
Beauteous the temple deck'd and <mark4>fill'd,</mark4><br>
When to the heav'n of heav'ns they <mark4>build</mark4><br>
Their heart-directed <mark4>vows.</mark4><br>
<br>
Beauteous, yea beauteous more than <mark4>these,</mark4><br>
The shepherd king upon his <mark3>knees,</mark3><br>
For his momentous <mark4>trust;</mark4><br>
With wish of infinite <mark4>conceit,</mark4><br>
For man, beast, <mark4>mute</mark4>, the small and <mark4>great,</mark4><br>
And prostrate dust to <mark4>dust.</mark4><br>
<br>
Precious the bounteous widow's <mark4>mite;</mark4><br>
And precious, for extreme <mark3>delight,</mark3><br>
      The largess from the churl:<br>
Precious the ruby's blushing <mark4>blaze,</mark4><br>
And alba's blest imperial <mark3>rays,</mark3><br>
And pure cerulean <mark4>pearl.</mark4><br>
<br>
Precious the penitential <mark3>tear;</mark3><br>
And precious is the sigh <mark3>sincere,</mark3><br>
Acceptable to <mark4>God:</mark4><br>
And precious are the winning <mark4>flow'rs,</mark4><br>
In gladsome Israel's feast of <mark3>bow'rs,</mark3><br>
Bound on the hallow'd <mark3>sod.</mark3><br>
<br>
More precious that diviner <mark4>part</mark4><br>
Of David, ev'n the Lord's own <mark3>heart,</mark3><br>
Great, beautiful, and <mark3>new:</mark3><br>
In all things where it was <mark4>intent,</mark4><br>
In all extremes, in each <mark3>event,</mark3><br>
Proof--answ'ring true to <mark3>true.</mark3><br>
<br>
Glorious the sun in mid <mark3>career;</mark3><br>
Glorious th' assembled fires <mark3>appear;</mark3><br>
Glorious the comet's <mark4>train:</mark4><br>
Glorious the trumpet and <mark4>alarm;</mark4><br>
Glorious th' almighty stretch'd-out <mark3>arm;</mark3><br>
Glorious th' enraptur'd <mark3>main:</mark3><br>
<br>
Glorious the northern lights <mark4>a-stream;</mark4><br>
Glorious the song, when God's the <mark3>theme;</mark3><br>
Glorious the thunder's <mark4>roar:</mark4><br>
Glorious hosanna from the <mark4>den;</mark4><br>
Glorious the catholic <mark3>amen;</mark3><br>
Glorious the martyr's <mark3>gore:</mark3><br>
<br>
Glorious--more glorious is the <mark4>crown</mark4><br>
Of Him that brought salvation <mark3>down</mark3><br>
By meekness, call'd thy <mark4>Son;</mark4><br>
Thou that stupendous truth <mark5>believ'd,</mark5><br>
And now the matchless deed's achiev'd,<br>
Determin'd, dar'd, and <mark3>done.</mark3><br>
