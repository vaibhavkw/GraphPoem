Title : A Song from the Italian from Limberham: or, the Kind Keeper <br>
Author : John Dryden <br><br>

By a dismal cypress <mark3>lying,</mark3><br>
Damon cried, all pale and <mark3>dying,</mark3><br>
Kind is death that ends my <mark3>pain,</mark3><br>
But cruel she I lov'd in <mark3>vain.</mark3><br>
The mossy <mark3>fountains</mark3><br>
Murmur my <mark3>trouble,</mark3><br>
And hollow <mark3>mountains</mark3><br>
My groans <mark3>redouble:</mark3><br>
Ev'ry nymph mourns <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Thus while I <mark3>languish;</mark3><br>
She only scorns <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Who caus'd my <mark3>anguish.</mark3><br>
No love returning me, but all hope <mark3>denying;</mark3><br>
By a dismal cypress <mark1>lying,</mark1><br>
Like a swan, so sung he <mark1>dying:</mark1><br>
Kind is death that ends my <mark1>pain,</mark1><br>
But cruel she I lov'd in <mark1>vain.</mark1><br>
