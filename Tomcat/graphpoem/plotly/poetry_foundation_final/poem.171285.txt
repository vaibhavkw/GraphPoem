Title : Coal <br>
Author : Audre Lorde <br><br>

<br>
Is the total black, being <mark4>spoken</mark4><br>
From the earth's <mark4>inside.</mark4><br>
There are many kinds of <mark4>open.</mark4><br>
How a diamond comes into a knot of <mark1>flame</mark1><br>
How a sound comes into a <mark4>word</mark4>, <mark4>coloured</mark4><br>
By who pays what for <mark4>speaking.</mark4><br>
<br>
Some words are <mark1>open</mark1><br>
Like a diamond on glass <mark4>windows</mark4><br>
Singing out within the crash of passing <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
Then there are words like stapled <mark4>wagers</mark4><br>
In a perforated book--buy and sign and tear <mark4>apart--</mark4><br>
And come whatever wills all <mark4>chances</mark4><br>
The stub <mark4>remains</mark4><br>
An ill-pulled tooth with a ragged edge. <br>
Some words live in my <mark4>throat</mark4><br>
Breeding like adders. Others know <mark1>sun</mark1><br>
Seeking like gypsies over my <mark4>tongue</mark4><br>
To explode through my lips <br>
Like young sparrows bursting from shell. <br>
Some <mark4>words</mark4><br>
Bedevil me. <br>
<br>
Love is a word another kind of <mark1>open--</mark1><br>
As a diamond comes into a knot of <mark1>flame</mark1><br>
I am black because I come from the earth's <mark1>inside</mark1><br>
Take my word for jewel in your open <mark4>light.</mark4><br>
