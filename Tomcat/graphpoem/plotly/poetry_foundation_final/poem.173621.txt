Title : Aaron <br>
Author : George Herbert <br><br>

Holiness on the <mark3>head,</mark3><br>
Light and perfections on the <mark3>breast,</mark3><br>
Harmonious bells below, raising the <mark3>dead</mark3><br>
To lead them unto life and <mark3>rest:</mark3><br>
Thus are true Aarons <mark1>drest.</mark1><br>
<br>
Profaneness in my <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
Defects and darkness in my <mark1>breast,</mark1><br>
A noise of passions ringing me for <mark1>dead</mark1><br>
Unto a place where is no <mark1>rest:</mark1><br>
Poor priest, thus am I <mark1>drest.</mark1><br>
<br>
Only another <mark1>head</mark1><br>
I have, another heart and <mark1>breast,</mark1><br>
Another music, making live, not <mark1>dead,</mark1><br>
Without whom I could have no <mark1>rest:</mark1><br>
In him I am well <mark1>drest.</mark1><br>
<br>
Christ is my only <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
My alone-only heart and <mark1>breast,</mark1><br>
My only music, striking me ev'n <mark1>dead,</mark1><br>
That to the old man I may <mark1>rest,</mark1><br>
                And be in him new-drest. <br>
<br>
So, holy in my <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
Perfect and light in my dear <mark1>breast,</mark1><br>
My doctrine tun'd by Christ (who is not <mark1>dead,</mark1><br>
But lives in me while I do <mark1>rest),</mark1><br>
Come people; Aaron's <mark1>drest.</mark1><br>
