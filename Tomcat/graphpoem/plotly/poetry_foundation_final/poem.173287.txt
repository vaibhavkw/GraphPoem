Title : On Receipt Of My Mother's Picture <br>
Author : William Cowper <br><br>

Oh that those lips had language! Life has <mark4>pass'd</mark4><br>
With me but roughly since I heard thee <mark4>last.</mark4><br>
Those lips are thine--thy own sweet smiles I <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
The same that oft in childhood solaced <mark3>me;</mark3><br>
Voice only fails, else, how distinct they <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
"Grieve not, my child, chase all thy fears <mark3>away!"</mark3><br>
The meek intelligence of those dear <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
(Blest be the art that can <mark4>immortalize,</mark4><br>
The art that baffles time's tyrannic <mark3>claim</mark3><br>
To quench it) here shines on me still the <mark3>same.</mark3><br>
<br>
Faithful remembrancer of one so <mark4>dear,</mark4><br>
Oh welcome guest, though unexpected, <mark4>here!</mark4><br>
Who bidd'st me honour with an artless <mark3>song,</mark3><br>
Affectionate, a mother lost so <mark3>long,</mark3><br>
I will obey, not willingly <mark3>alone,</mark3><br>
But gladly, as the precept were her <mark3>own;</mark3><br>
And, while that face renews my filial <mark3>grief,</mark3><br>
Fancy shall weave a charm for my <mark3>relief--</mark3><br>
Shall steep me in Elysian reverie,<br>
A momentary dream, that thou art <mark3>she.</mark3><br>
<br>
My mother! when I learn'd that thou wast <mark5>dead,</mark5><br>
Say, wast thou conscious of the tears I <mark3>shed?</mark3><br>
Hover'd thy spirit o'er thy sorrowing <mark4>son,</mark4><br>
Wretch even <mark4>then</mark4>, life's journey just <mark3>begun?</mark3><br>
Perhaps thou gav'st me, though unseen, a <mark3>kiss;</mark3><br>
Perhaps a tear, if souls can weep in <mark3>bliss--</mark3><br>
Ah that maternal smile! it answers--Yes.<br>
I heard the bell toll'd on thy burial <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
I saw the hearse that bore thee slow <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
And, turning from my nurs'ry window, <mark3>drew</mark3><br>
A long, long sigh, and wept a last <mark3>adieu!</mark3><br>
But was it such?--It was.--Where thou art <mark4>gone</mark4><br>
Adieus and farewells are a sound <mark4>unknown.</mark4><br>
May I but meet thee on that peaceful <mark4>shore,</mark4><br>
The parting sound shall pass my lips no <mark3>more!</mark3><br>
Thy maidens griev'd themselves at my <mark4>concern,</mark4><br>
Oft gave me promise of a quick <mark3>return.</mark3><br>
What ardently I wish'd, I long <mark5>believ'd,</mark5><br>
And, disappointed still, was still deceiv'd;<br>
By disappointment every day <mark5>beguil'd,</mark5><br>
Dupe of to-morrow even from a <mark4>child.</mark4><br>
Thus many a sad to-morrow came and <mark4>went,</mark4><br>
Till, all my stock of infant sorrow <mark3>spent,</mark3><br>
I learn'd at last submission to my <mark4>lot;</mark4><br>
But, though I less deplor'd thee, ne'er <mark3>forgot.</mark3><br>
<br>
Where once we dwelt our name is heard no <mark1>more,</mark1><br>
Children not thine have trod my nurs'ry <mark3>floor;</mark3><br>
And where the gard'ner Robin, day by <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
Drew me to school along the public <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
Delighted with my bauble coach, and wrapt<br>
In scarlet mantle warm, and velvet capt,<br>
'Tis now become a history little <mark4>known,</mark4><br>
That once we call'd the past'ral house our <mark1>own.</mark1><br>
Short-liv'd possession! but the record <mark4>fair</mark4><br>
That mem'ry keeps of all thy kindness <mark3>there,</mark3><br>
Still outlives many a storm that has effac'd<br>
A thousand other themes less deeply <mark4>trac'd.</mark4><br>
Thy nightly visits to my chamber <mark4>made,</mark4><br>
That thou might'st know me safe and warmly <mark3>laid;</mark3><br>
Thy morning bounties ere I left my <mark4>home,</mark4><br>
The biscuit, or confectionary <mark4>plum;</mark4><br>
The fragrant waters on my cheeks <mark4>bestow'd</mark4><br>
By thy own hand, till fresh they shone and <mark3>glow'd;</mark3><br>
All this, and more endearing still than <mark3>all,</mark3><br>
Thy constant flow of love, that knew no <mark3>fall,</mark3><br>
Ne'er roughen'd by those cataracts and <mark4>brakes</mark4><br>
That humour interpos'd too often <mark3>makes;</mark3><br>
All this still legible in mem'ry's <mark3>page,</mark3><br>
And still to be so, to my latest <mark3>age,</mark3><br>
Adds joy to duty, makes me glad to <mark3>pay</mark3><br>
Such honours to thee as my numbers <mark3>may;</mark3><br>
Perhaps a frail memorial, but <mark4>sincere,</mark4><br>
Not scorn'd in heav'n, though little notic'd <mark1>here.</mark1><br>
<br>
Could time, his flight revers'd, restore the <mark4>hours,</mark4><br>
When, playing with thy vesture's tissued <mark4>flow'rs,</mark4><br>
The violet, the pink, and <mark4>jessamine,</mark4><br>
I prick'd them into paper with a <mark4>pin,</mark4><br>
(And thou wast happier than myself the <mark4>while,</mark4><br>
Would'st softly speak, and stroke my head and <mark3>smile)</mark3><br>
Could those few pleasant hours again <mark4>appear,</mark4><br>
Might one wish bring them, would I wish them <mark1>here?</mark1><br>
I would not trust my heart--the dear <mark4>delight</mark4><br>
Seems so to be desir'd, perhaps I <mark3>might.--</mark3><br>
But no--what here we call our life is <mark3>such,</mark3><br>
So little to be lov'd, and thou so <mark3>much,</mark3><br>
That I should ill requite thee to <mark4>constrain</mark4><br>
Thy unbound spirit into bonds <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thou, as a gallant bark from Albion's <mark4>coast</mark4><br>
(The storms all weather'd and the ocean <mark4>cross'd)</mark4><br>
Shoots into port at some well-haven'd <mark3>isle,</mark3><br>
Where spices breathe and brighter seasons <mark1>smile,</mark1><br>
There sits quiescent on the floods that <mark5>show</mark5><br>
Her beauteous form reflected clear <mark3>below,</mark3><br>
While airs impregnated with incense <mark3>play</mark3><br>
Around her, fanning light her streamers <mark3>gay;</mark3><br>
So thou, with sails how swift! hast reach'd the <mark1>shore</mark1><br>
"Where tempests never beat nor billows <mark3>roar,"</mark3><br>
And thy lov'd consort on the dang'rous <mark4>tide</mark4><br>
Of life, long since, has anchor'd at thy <mark3>side.</mark3><br>
But me, scarce hoping to attain that <mark4>rest,</mark4><br>
Always from port withheld, always <mark4>distress'd--</mark4><br>
Me howling winds drive devious, tempest <mark4>toss'd,</mark4><br>
Sails ript, seams op'ning wide, and compass <mark4>lost,</mark4><br>
And day by day some current's thwarting <mark4>force</mark4><br>
Sets me more distant from a prosp'rous <mark3>course.</mark3><br>
But oh the thought, that thou art safe, and <mark3>he!</mark3><br>
That thought is joy, arrive what may to <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
My boast is not that I deduce my <mark3>birth</mark3><br>
From loins enthron'd, and rulers of the <mark3>earth;</mark3><br>
But higher far my proud pretensions <mark4>rise--</mark4><br>
The son of parents pass'd into the <mark3>skies.</mark3><br>
And now, farewell--time, unrevok'd, has <mark4>run</mark4><br>
His wonted course, yet what I wish'd is <mark3>done.</mark3><br>
By contemplation's help, not sought in <mark4>vain,</mark4><br>
I seem t' have liv'd my childhood o'er <mark1>again;</mark1><br>
To have renew'd the joys that once were <mark4>mine,</mark4><br>
Without the sin of violating <mark3>thine:</mark3><br>
And, while the wings of fancy still are <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
And I can view this mimic shew of <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
Time has but half succeeded in his <mark4>theft--</mark4><br>
Thyself remov'd, thy power to sooth me <mark3>left.</mark3><br>
