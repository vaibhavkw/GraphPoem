Title : I Dug, Beneath the Cypress Shade <br>
Author : Thomas Love Peacock <br><br>

<br>
I dug, beneath the cypress <mark3>shade,</mark3><br>
What well might seem an elfin's <mark3>grave;</mark3><br>
And every pledge in earth I <mark3>laid,</mark3><br>
That erst thy false affection <mark3>gave.</mark3><br>
<br>
I pressed them down the sod <mark3>beneath;</mark3><br>
I placed one mossy stone <mark4>above;</mark4><br>
And twined the rose's fading <mark3>wreath</mark3><br>
Around the sepulchre of <mark3>love.</mark3><br>
<br>
Frail as thy love, the flowers were <mark4>dead,</mark4><br>
Ere yet the evening sun was <mark3>set:</mark3><br>
But years shall see the cypress <mark3>spread,</mark3><br>
Immutable as my <mark3>regret.</mark3><br>
