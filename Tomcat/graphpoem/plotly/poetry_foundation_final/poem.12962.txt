Title : Crossroads<br>
Author : Mary Barnard<br><br>

Rotting in the wet gray air <br>
the railroad depot stands deserted <mark4>under</mark4><br>
still green <mark4>trees</mark4>, In the <mark4>fields</mark4><br>
cold begins an end. <br>
<br>
There were other too-long-postponed <mark4>departures.</mark4><br>
They left, finally, because of well <mark4>water</mark4><br>
gone rank, the smell of fungus, the <mark5>chill</mark5><br>
of rain in <mark4>chimneys.</mark4><br>
<br>
The spot is abandoned even in memory. <br>
They knew, locking doors upon empty <mark4>houses,</mark4><br>
to leave without regret is to <mark4>lose</mark4><br>
title to one home <mark4>forever.</mark4><br>
