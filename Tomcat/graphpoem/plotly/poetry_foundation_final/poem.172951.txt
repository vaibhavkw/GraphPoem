Title : Evening <br>
Author : William Lisle Bowles <br><br>

Evening! as slow thy placid shades <mark3>descend,</mark3><br>
Veiling with gentlest hush the landscape <mark3>still,</mark3><br>
The lonely battlement, the farthest <mark3>hill</mark3><br>
And <mark4>wood</mark4>, I think of those who have no <mark3>friend;</mark3><br>
Who now, perhaps, by melancholy <mark4>led,</mark4><br>
From the broad blaze of day, where pleasure <mark3>flaunts,</mark3><br>
Retiring, wander to the ring-dove's <mark3>haunts</mark3><br>
Unseen; and watch the tints that o'er thy <mark3>bed</mark3><br>
Hang lovely; oft to musing Fancy's eye <br>
Presenting fairy vales, where the tir'd <mark4>mind</mark4><br>
Might rest beyond the murmurs of <mark3>mankind,</mark3><br>
Nor hear the hourly moans of misery! <br>
Alas for man! that Hope's fair views the <mark4>while</mark4><br>
Should smile like you, and perish as they <mark3>smile!</mark3><br>
