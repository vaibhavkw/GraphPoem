Title : Home <br>
Author : Edgar Albert Guest <br><br>

It takes a heap o' livin' in a house t' make it <mark3>home,</mark3><br>
A heap o' sun an' shadder, an' ye sometimes have t' <mark3>roam</mark3><br>
Afore ye really 'preciate the things ye lef' <mark3>behind,</mark3><br>
An' hunger fer 'em somehow, with 'em allus on yer <mark3>mind.</mark3><br>
It don't make any differunce how rich ye get t' <mark4>be,</mark4><br>
How much yer chairs an' tables cost, how great yer <mark4>luxury;</mark4><br>
It ain't home t' ye, though it be the palace of a <mark4>king,</mark4><br>
Until somehow yer soul is sort o' wrapped round <mark4>everything.</mark4><br>
<br>
Home ain't a place that gold can buy or get up in a <mark5>minute;</mark5><br>
Afore it's home there's got t' be a heap o' livin' in <mark4>it;</mark4><br>
Within the walls there's got t' be some babies <mark4>born</mark4>, and <mark4>then</mark4><br>
Right there ye've got t' bring 'em up t' women good, an' <mark3>men;</mark3><br>
And gradjerly, as time goes on, ye find ye wouldn't <mark4>part</mark4><br>
With anything they ever used--they've grown into yer <mark3>heart:</mark3><br>
The old high chairs, the playthings, too, the little shoes they <mark3>wore</mark3><br>
Ye hoard; an' if ye could ye'd keep the thumbmarks on the <mark3>door.</mark3><br>
<br>
Ye've got t' weep t' make it home, ye've got t' sit an' <mark3>sigh</mark3><br>
An' watch beside a loved one's bed, an' know that Death is <mark3>nigh;</mark3><br>
An' in the stillness o' the night t' see Death's angel <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
An' close the eyes o' her that smiled, an' leave her sweet voice <mark3>dumb.</mark3><br>
Fer these are scenes that grip the heart, an' when yer tears are <mark4>dried,</mark4><br>
Ye find the home is dearer than it was, an' sanctified; <br>
An' tuggin' at ye always are the pleasant <mark4>memories</mark4><br>
O' her that was an' is no more--ye can't escape from <mark4>these.</mark4><br>
<br>
Ye've got t' sing an' dance fer years, ye've got t' romp an' <mark3>play,</mark3><br>
An' learn t' love the things ye have by usin' 'em each <mark3>day;</mark3><br>
Even the roses 'round the porch must blossom year by <mark4>year</mark4><br>
Afore they 'come a part o' ye, suggestin' someone <mark3>dear</mark3><br>
Who used t' love 'em long ago, an' trained 'em jes' t' <mark4>run</mark4><br>
The way they do, so's they would get the early mornin' <mark3>sun;</mark3><br>
Ye've got t' love each brick an' stone from cellar up t' <mark4>dome:</mark4><br>
It takes a heap o' livin' in a house t' make it <mark1>home.</mark1><br>
