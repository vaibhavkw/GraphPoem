Title : Stanzas for Music <br>
Author : Lord Byron (George Gordon) <br><br>

There be none of Beauty's <mark3>daughters</mark3><br>
With a magic like <mark3>thee;</mark3><br>
And like music on the <mark3>waters</mark3><br>
Is thy sweet voice to <mark3>me:</mark3><br>
When, as if its sound were <mark3>causing</mark3><br>
The charmed ocean's <mark3>pausing,</mark3><br>
The waves lie still and <mark4>gleaming,</mark4><br>
And the lull'd winds seem <mark3>dreaming:</mark3><br>
<br>
And the midnight moon is <mark4>weaving</mark4><br>
Her bright chain o'er the <mark3>deep;</mark3><br>
Whose breast is gently <mark3>heaving,</mark3><br>
As an infant's <mark3>asleep:</mark3><br>
So the spirit bows before <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
To listen and adore <mark1>thee;</mark1><br>
With a full but soft <mark3>emotion,</mark3><br>
Like the swell of Summer's <mark3>ocean.</mark3><br>
