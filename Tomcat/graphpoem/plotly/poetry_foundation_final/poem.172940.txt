Title : Song: How sweet I roam'd from field to field <br>
Author : William Blake <br><br>

How sweet I roam'd from field to <mark4>field,</mark4><br>
And tasted all the summer's <mark4>pride,</mark4><br>
'Till I the prince of love <mark4>beheld,</mark4><br>
Who in the sunny beams did <mark4>glide!</mark4><br>
<br>
He shew'd me lilies for my <mark3>hair,</mark3><br>
         And blushing roses for my brow; <br>
He led me through his gardens <mark3>fair,</mark3><br>
         Where all his golden pleasures grow. <br>
<br>
With sweet May dews my wings were <mark3>wet,</mark3><br>
And Phoebus fir'd my vocal <mark3>rage;</mark3><br>
He caught me in his silken <mark3>net,</mark3><br>
And shut me in his golden <mark3>cage.</mark3><br>
<br>
He loves to sit and hear me <mark3>sing,</mark3><br>
         Then, laughing, sports and plays with me; <br>
Then stretches out my golden <mark3>wing,</mark3><br>
         And mocks my loss of liberty.<br>
