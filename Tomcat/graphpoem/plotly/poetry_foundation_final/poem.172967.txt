Title : The night is darkening round me <br>
Author : Emily Bronte <br><br>

The night is darkening round <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
The wild winds coldly <mark3>blow;</mark3><br>
But a tyrant spell has bound <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
And I cannot, cannot <mark3>go.</mark3><br>
<br>
The giant trees are <mark3>bending</mark3><br>
Their bare boughs weighed with <mark3>snow;</mark3><br>
The storm is fast <mark3>descending,</mark3><br>
And yet I cannot <mark1>go.</mark1><br>
<br>
Clouds beyond clouds above <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Wastes beyond wastes <mark3>below;</mark3><br>
But nothing drear can move <mark1>me;</mark1><br>
I will not, cannot <mark1>go.</mark1><br>
