Title : Alone, Drinking With the Tickfaw River <br>
Author : Alison Pelegrin <br><br>

Featherweight lawn chair, cooler for a footrest,<br>
and me a squatter on the landlord's dock<br>
where baitstealers teased a thousand times a day<br>
until rowdy boats and summer scared them deep.<br>
Day and night I snoozed on the porch<br>
beneath a filthy orbit of fanblades<br>
to the opera of my neighbors <mark4>fighting</mark4><br>
and reconciling in the glow of stolen <mark5>wattage.</mark5><br>
<br>
I saw them swimming once. Maybe <mark4>naked,</mark4><br>
judging from their skittish talk, but the <mark5>water</mark5><br>
smeared their bodies' pale <mark4>particulars.</mark4><br>
It was just me and the Tickfaw <mark4>River.</mark4><br>
Me with the taste of a tin can in my mouth,<br>
feeling no pain, lighting a cigarette <mark4>backwards,</mark4><br>
the Tickfaw tricking me closer and <mark4>closer</mark4><br>
with echoes and music out of nowhere.<br>
<br>
Is it funny that I was too lit to notice<br>
twenty-five orange yards of extension <mark4>cord</mark4><br>
stretching from my outlet, over the driveway <mark4>shells,</mark4><br>
to feed the hungry plug of their deep <mark4>freezer?</mark4><br>
Mother would have pitched a fit if she <mark4>discovered</mark4><br>
the stash of whiskey in the woodpile,<br>
and my father wasn't <mark4>laughing</mark4><br>
if he looked down from his company of <mark4>stars.</mark4><br>
