Title : To a Skylark <br>
Author : William Wordsworth <br><br>

Ethereal minstrel! pilgrim of the <mark3>sky!</mark3><br>
Dost thou despise the earth where cares <mark3>abound?</mark3><br>
Or, while the wings aspire, are heart and <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
Both with thy nest upon the dewy <mark3>ground?</mark3><br>
Thy nest which thou canst drop into at <mark3>will,</mark3><br>
Those quivering wings composed, that music <mark3>still!</mark3><br>
<br>
Leave to the nightingale her shady <mark4>wood;</mark4><br>
A privacy of glorious light is <mark3>thine;</mark3><br>
Whence thou dost pour upon the world a <mark4>flood</mark4><br>
Of harmony, with instinct more <mark3>divine;</mark3><br>
Type of the wise who soar, but never <mark3>roam;</mark3><br>
True to the kindred points of Heaven and <mark3>Home!</mark3><br>
