Title : Follow Thy Fair Sun <br>
Author : Thomas Campion <br><br>

Follow thy fair sun, unhappy <mark1>shadow,</mark1><br>
Though thou be black as <mark3>night</mark3><br>
And she made all of <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
Yet follow thy fair sun unhappy <mark1>shadow.</mark1><br>
<br>
Follow her whose light thy light depriveth, <br>
Though here thou liv'st <mark4>disgraced,</mark4><br>
And she in heaven is <mark3>placed,</mark3><br>
Yet follow her whose light the world reviveth. <br>
<br>
Follow those pure beams whose beauty burneth, <br>
That so have scorched <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
As thou still black must <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
Till Her kind beams thy black to brightness turneth. <br>
<br>
Follow her while yet her glory shineth, <br>
There comes a luckless <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
That will dim all her <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
And this the black unhappy shade divineth. <br>
<br>
Follow still since so thy fates <mark4>ordained,</mark4><br>
The Sun must have his <mark4>shade,</mark4><br>
Till both at once do <mark3>fade,</mark3><br>
The Sun still <mark4>proved</mark4>, the shadow still <mark4>disdained.</mark4><br>
