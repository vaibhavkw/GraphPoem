Title : Song: My silks and fine array <br>
Author : William Blake <br><br>

My silks and fine <mark3>array,</mark3><br>
My smiles and languish'd <mark3>air,</mark3><br>
By love are driv'n <mark3>away;</mark3><br>
And mournful lean <mark3>Despair</mark3><br>
Brings me yew to deck my <mark4>grave:</mark4><br>
Such end true lovers <mark4>have.</mark4><br>
<br>
His face is fair as heav'n, <br>
When springing buds <mark3>unfold;</mark3><br>
O why to him was't giv'n, <br>
Whose heart is wintry <mark3>cold?</mark3><br>
His breast is love's all worship'd <mark4>tomb,</mark4><br>
Where all love's pilgrims <mark4>come.</mark4><br>
<br>
Bring me an axe and <mark4>spade,</mark4><br>
Bring me a winding <mark3>sheet;</mark3><br>
When I my grave have <mark3>made,</mark3><br>
Let winds and tempests <mark3>beat:</mark3><br>
Then down I'll lie, as cold as <mark3>clay.</mark3><br>
True love doth pass <mark1>away!</mark1><br>
