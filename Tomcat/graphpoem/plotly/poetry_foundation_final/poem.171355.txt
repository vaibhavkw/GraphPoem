Title : The Foggy, Foggy Blue <br>
Author : Delmore Schwartz <br><br>

When I was a young man, I loved to write <mark4>poems</mark4><br>
And I called a spade a <mark3>spade</mark3><br>
And the only only thing that made me <mark4>sing</mark4><br>
Was to lift the masks at the <mark3>masquerade.</mark3><br>
I took them off my own <mark5>face,</mark5><br>
I took them off others <mark3>too</mark3><br>
And the only only wrong in all my <mark4>song</mark4><br>
Was the view that I knew what was <mark3>true.</mark3><br>
<br>
Now I am older and tireder <mark1>too</mark1><br>
And the tasks with the masks are quite <mark4>trying.</mark4><br>
I'd gladly gladly stop if I only only <mark3>knew</mark3><br>
A better way to keep from <mark3>lying,</mark3><br>
And not get nervous and <mark3>blue</mark3><br>
When I said something quite <mark3>untrue:</mark3><br>
I looked all around and all over <br>
To find something else to <mark3>do:</mark3><br>
I tried to be less <mark3>romantic</mark3><br>
I tried to be less starry-eyed <mark1>too:</mark1><br>
But I only got mixed up and <mark3>frantic</mark3><br>
Forgetting what was false and what was <mark1>true.</mark1><br>
<br>
But tonight I am going to the masked ball, <br>
Because it has occurred to <mark1>me</mark1><br>
That the masks are more true than the <mark4>faces:</mark4><br>
--Perhaps this too is <mark5>poetry?</mark5><br>
I no longer yearn to be naive and stern <br>
And masked balls fascinate <mark1>me:</mark1><br>
Now that I know that most falsehoods are <mark1>true</mark1><br>
Perhaps I can join the <mark3>charade?</mark3><br>
This is, at any rate, my new and true <mark3>view:</mark3><br>
Let live and believe, I <mark3>say.</mark3><br>
The only only thing is to believe in <mark4>everything:</mark4><br>
It's more fun and safer that <mark3>way!</mark3><br>
