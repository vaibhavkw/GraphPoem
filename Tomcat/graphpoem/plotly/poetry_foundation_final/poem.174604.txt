Title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 30 <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

With trembling fingers did we <mark3>weave</mark3><br>
The holly round the Christmas <mark4>hearth;</mark4><br>
A rainy cloud possess'd the <mark4>earth,</mark4><br>
And sadly fell our <mark3>Christmas-eve.</mark3><br>
<br>
At our old pastimes in the <mark3>hall</mark3><br>
         We gambol'd, making vain pretence <br>
         Of gladness, with an awful sense <br>
Of one mute Shadow watching <mark3>all.</mark3><br>
<br>
We paused: the winds were in the <mark3>beech:</mark3><br>
         We heard them sweep the winter land; <br>
And in a circle <mark4>hand-in-hand</mark4><br>
Sat silent, looking each at <mark3>each.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then echo-like our voices <mark3>rang;</mark3><br>
We sung, tho' every eye was <mark3>dim,</mark3><br>
A merry song we sang with <mark3>him</mark3><br>
Last year: impetuously we <mark3>sang:</mark3><br>
<br>
We ceased: a gentler feeling <mark4>crept</mark4><br>
Upon us: surely rest is <mark4>meet:</mark4><br>
"They rest," we said, "their sleep is <mark3>sweet,"</mark3><br>
And silence follow'd, and we <mark4>wept.</mark4><br>
<br>
Our voices took a higher <mark5>range;</mark5><br>
         Once more we sang: "They do not die <br>
         Nor lose their mortal sympathy, <br>
Nor change to us, although they <mark3>change;</mark3><br>
<br>
"Rapt from the fickle and the <mark4>frail</mark4><br>
With gather'd power, yet the <mark4>same,</mark4><br>
Pierces the keen seraphic <mark3>flame</mark3><br>
From orb to orb, from veil to <mark3>veil."</mark3><br>
<br>
Rise, happy morn, rise, holy <mark4>morn,</mark4><br>
Draw forth the cheerful day from <mark4>night:</mark4><br>
O Father, touch the <mark4>east</mark4>, and <mark3>light</mark3><br>
The light that shone when Hope was <mark3>born.</mark3><br>
