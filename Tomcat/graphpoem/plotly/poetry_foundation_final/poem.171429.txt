Title : Buckdancer's Choice <br>
Author : James L. Dickey <br><br>

So I would hear out those <mark4>lungs,</mark4><br>
The air split into nine <mark4>levels,</mark4><br>
Some gift of tongues of the <mark4>whistler</mark4><br>
<br>
In the invalid's bed: my <mark4>mother,</mark4><br>
Warbling all day to <mark4>herself</mark4><br>
The thousand variations of one <mark4>song;</mark4><br>
<br>
It is called Buckdancer's Choice.   <br>
For years, they have all been <mark4>dying</mark4><br>
Out, the classic buck-and-wing <mark4>men</mark4><br>
<br>
Of traveling minstrel <mark4>shows;</mark4><br>
With them also an old <mark4>woman</mark4><br>
Was dying of breathless angina, <br>
<br>
Yet still found breath <mark4>enough</mark4><br>
To whistle up in my <mark4>head</mark4><br>
A sight like a one-man <mark4>band,</mark4><br>
<br>
Freed black, with cymbals at <mark4>heel,</mark4><br>
An ex-slave who thrivingly <mark4>danced</mark4><br>
To the ring of his own clashing <mark4>light</mark4><br>
<br>
Through the thousand variations of one <mark1>song</mark1><br>
All day to my mother's prone <mark4>music,</mark4><br>
The invalid's warbler's <mark4>note,</mark4><br>
<br>
While I crept close to the <mark4>wall</mark4><br>
Sock-footed, to hear the sounds <mark4>alter,</mark4><br>
Her tongue like a mockingbird's <mark4>break</mark4><br>
<br>
Through stratum after stratum of a <mark4>tone</mark4><br>
Proclaiming what choices there <mark3>are</mark3><br>
For the last dancers of their <mark4>kind,</mark4><br>
<br>
For ill women and for all <mark4>slaves</mark4><br>
Of death, and children enchanted at <mark4>walls</mark4><br>
With a brass-beating glow <mark4>underfoot,</mark4><br>
<br>
Not dancing but nearly <mark4>risen</mark4><br>
Through barnlike, theatrelike <mark4>houses</mark4><br>
On the wings of the buck and <mark4>wing.</mark4><br>
