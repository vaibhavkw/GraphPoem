Title : Time <br>
Author : Percy Bysshe Shelley <br><br>

Unfathomable Sea! whose waves are <mark3>years,</mark3><br>
Ocean of Time, whose waters of deep <mark3>woe</mark3><br>
Are brackish with the salt of human <mark3>tears!</mark3><br>
Thou shoreless flood, which in thy ebb and <mark3>flow</mark3><br>
Claspest the limits of <mark5>mortality!</mark5><br>
<br>
And sick of prey, yet howling on for <mark5>more,</mark5><br>
Vomitest thy wrecks on its inhospitable <mark3>shore;</mark3><br>
Treacherous in <mark4>calm</mark4>, and terrible in <mark4>storm,</mark4><br>
Who shall put forth on <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
Unfathomable <mark3>Sea?</mark3><br>
