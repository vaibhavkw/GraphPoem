Title : The Jewish Cemetery at Newport <br>
Author : Henry Wadsworth Longfellow <br><br>

How strange it seems! These Hebrews in their <mark3>graves,</mark3><br>
Close by the street of this fair seaport <mark3>town,</mark3><br>
Silent beside the never-silent <mark3>waves,</mark3><br>
At rest in all this moving up and <mark3>down!</mark3><br>
<br>
The trees are white with dust, that o'er their <mark3>sleep</mark3><br>
Wave their broad curtains in the south-wind's <mark3>breath,</mark3><br>
While underneath these leafy tents they <mark3>keep</mark3><br>
The long, mysterious Exodus of <mark3>Death.</mark3><br>
<br>
And these sepulchral stones, so old and <mark3>brown,</mark3><br>
That pave with level flags their <mark3>burial-place,</mark3><br>
Seem like the tablets of the Law, thrown <mark1>down</mark1><br>
And broken by Moses at the mountain's <mark3>base.</mark3><br>
<br>
The very names recorded here are <mark3>strange,</mark3><br>
Of foreign accent, and of different <mark4>climes;</mark4><br>
Alvares and Rivera <mark3>interchange</mark3><br>
With Abraham and Jacob of old <mark3>times.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Blessed be God! for he created <mark1>Death!"</mark1><br>
The mourners said, "and Death is rest and <mark4>peace;"</mark4><br>
Then added, in the certainty of <mark4>faith,</mark4><br>
"And giveth Life that nevermore shall <mark3>cease."</mark3><br>
<br>
Closed are the portals of their Synagogue, <br>
No Psalms of David now the silence <mark5>break,</mark5><br>
No Rabbi reads the ancient Decalogue <br>
In the grand dialect the Prophets <mark3>spake.</mark3><br>
<br>
Gone are the living, but the dead <mark4>remain,</mark4><br>
And not neglected; for a hand <mark4>unseen,</mark4><br>
Scattering its bounty, like a summer <mark4>rain,</mark4><br>
Still keeps their graves and their remembrance <mark4>green.</mark4><br>
<br>
How came they here? What burst of Christian <mark4>hate,</mark4><br>
What persecution, merciless and <mark3>blind,</mark3><br>
Drove o'er the sea -- that desert desolate <mark4>--</mark4><br>
These Ishmaels and Hagars of <mark3>mankind?</mark3><br>
<br>
They lived in narrow streets and lanes <mark4>obscure,</mark4><br>
Ghetto and Judenstrass, in mirk and <mark4>mire;</mark4><br>
Taught in the school of patience to <mark4>endure</mark4><br>
The life of anguish and the death of <mark4>fire.</mark4><br>
<br>
All their lives long, with the unleavened <mark4>bread</mark4><br>
And bitter herbs of exile and its <mark4>fears,</mark4><br>
The wasting famine of the heart they <mark3>fed,</mark3><br>
And slaked its thirst with marah of their <mark3>tears.</mark3><br>
<br>
Anathema maranatha! was the cry <br>
That rang from town to town, from street to <mark4>street;</mark4><br>
At every gate the accursed Mordecai <br>
Was mocked and jeered, and spurned by Christian <mark3>feet.</mark3><br>
<br>
Pride and humiliation hand in <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
Walked with them through the world where'er they <mark4>went;</mark4><br>
Trampled and beaten were they as the <mark3>sand,</mark3><br>
And yet unshaken as the <mark4>continent.</mark4><br>
<br>
For in the background figures vague and <mark4>vast</mark4><br>
Of patriarchs and of prophets rose <mark3>sublime,</mark3><br>
And all the great traditions of the <mark3>Past</mark3><br>
They saw reflected in the coming <mark3>time.</mark3><br>
<br>
And thus forever with reverted <mark4>look</mark4><br>
The mystic volume of the world they <mark4>read,</mark4><br>
Spelling it backward, like a Hebrew <mark3>book,</mark3><br>
Till life became a Legend of the <mark3>Dead.</mark3><br>
<br>
But ah! what once has been shall be no <mark4>more!</mark4><br>
The groaning earth in travail and in <mark4>pain</mark4><br>
Brings forth its races, but does not <mark3>restore,</mark3><br>
And the dead nations never rise <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
