Title : The Mower to the Glow-Worms <br>
Author : Andrew Marvell <br><br>

Ye living lamps, by whose dear <mark4>light</mark4><br>
The nightingale does sit so <mark4>late,</mark4><br>
And studying all the summer <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
Her matchless songs does <mark4>meditate;</mark4><br>
<br>
Ye country comets, that <mark3>portend</mark3><br>
No war nor prince's <mark4>funeral,</mark4><br>
Shining unto no higher <mark3>end</mark3><br>
Than to presage the grass's <mark4>fall;</mark4><br>
<br>
Ye glow-worms, whose officious <mark3>flame</mark3><br>
To wand'ring mowers shows the <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
That in the night have lost their <mark3>aim,</mark3><br>
And after foolish fires do <mark3>stray;</mark3><br>
<br>
Your courteous lights in vain you <mark4>waste,</mark4><br>
Since Juliana here is <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
For she my mind hath so displac'd <br>
That I shall never find my <mark4>home.</mark4><br>
