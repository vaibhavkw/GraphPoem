Title : Navy Field <br>
Author : William Meredith <br><br>

Limped out of the hot sky a hurt <mark4>plane,</mark4><br>
Held off, held off, whirring pretty <mark4>pigeon,</mark4><br>
Hit then and scuttled to a crooked stop.<br>
The stranger pilot who emerged?this was the seashore, <br>
War came suddenly here?talked to the still <mark4>mechanics</mark4><br>
Who nodded gravely. Flak had done it, he said, <br>
From an enemy ship <mark4>attacked.</mark4><br>
                  They wheeled it with love <br>
Into the dark hangar's mouth and tended <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
Coffee and cake for the pilot then who sat <mark4>alone</mark4><br>
In the restaurant, reading the numbered <mark4>sheets</mark4><br>
That tell about weather.<br>
                  After, toward dusk,<br>
Mended the stranger plane went back to the <mark1>sky.</mark1><br>
His curly-headed picture, and mother's and medal's pictures <br>
Were all we knew of him after he rose <mark4>again,</mark4><br>
Those few electric jewels against the moth and whining <mark1>sky.</mark1><br>
