Title : Cicadas at the End of Summer <br>
Author : Martin Walls <br><br>

Whine as though a pine tree is bowing a broken <mark4>violin,</mark4><br>
As though a bandsaw cleaves a thousand thin sheets of <br>
<br>
They chime like freight wheels on a Norfolk <mark4>Southern</mark4><br>
slowing into <mark4>town.</mark4><br>
<br>
But all you ever see is the <mark4>silence.</mark4><br>
Husks, glued to the underside of maple <mark4>leaves.</mark4><br>
With their nineteen fifties Bakelite lines they'd do<br>
just as well hanging from the ceiling of a <mark4>space</mark4><br>
         museum ?<br>
<br>
What cicadas leave behind is a kind of crystallized <mark4>memory;</mark4><br>
The stubborn detail of, the shape around a life turned<br>
<br>
The color of forgotten things: a cold broth of tea & milk<br>
         in the bottom of a mug.<br>
Or skin on an old tin of varnish you have to lift with<br>
lineman's <mark4>pliers.</mark4><br>
A fly paper that hung thirty years in Bird Cooper's <mark4>pantry</mark4><br>
in <mark4>Brighton.</mark4><br>
