Title : Morningside Heights, July <br>
Author : William Matthews <br><br>

Haze. Three student violists <mark4>boarding</mark4><br>
a bus. A clatter of <mark4>jackhammers.</mark4><br>
Granular light. A film of sweat for <mark4>primer</mark4><br>
and the heat for a coat of <mark4>paint.</mark4><br>
A man and a woman on a bench:   <br>
she tells him he must be psychic, <br>
for how else could he sense, even before she knew,   <br>
that she'd need to call it off? A <mark4>bicyclist</mark4><br>
fumes by with a coach's whistle <mark4>clamped</mark4><br>
hard between his teeth, shrilling like a teakettle   <br>
on the boil. I never meant, she <mark4>says.</mark4><br>
But I thought, he replies. Two cabs <mark4>almost</mark4><br>
collide; someone yells fuck in Farsi.   <br>
I'm sorry, she says. The comforts   <br>
of loneliness fall in like a bad platoon.   <br>
The sky blurs--there's a storm <mark4>coming</mark4><br>
up or down. A lank cat slinks liquidly   <br>
around a <mark4>corner</mark4>, How <mark4>familiar</mark4><br>
it feels to feel strange, hollower <br>
than a bassoon. A rill of chill air <br>
in the leaves. A car alarm. Hail. <br>
