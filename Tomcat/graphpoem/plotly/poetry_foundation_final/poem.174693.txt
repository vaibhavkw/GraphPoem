Title : The Evening-Watch: A Dialogue <br>
Author : Henry Vaughan <br><br>

<br>
Farewell! I go to sleep; but <mark3>when</mark3><br>
The day-star springs, I'll wake <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
       Go, sleep in peace; and when thou liest<br>
<br>
Unnumber'd in thy dust, when all this <mark3>frame</mark3><br>
<br>
Is but one dram, and what thou now descriest<br>
In sev'ral parts shall want a <mark3>name,</mark3><br>
Then may his peace be with thee, and each <mark3>dust</mark3><br>
Writ in his book, who ne'er betray'd man's <mark3>trust!</mark3><br>
Amen! but hark, ere we two <mark3>stray</mark3><br>
How many hours dost think 'till <mark3>day?</mark3><br>
<br>
       Ah go; th'art weak, and sleepy. Heav'n<br>
<br>
Is a plain watch, and without figures <mark3>winds</mark3><br>
All ages up; who drew this circle, <mark4>even</mark4><br>
<br>
He fills it; days and hours are <mark3>blinds.</mark3><br>
<br>
Yet this take with thee. The last gasp of <mark4>time</mark4><br>
Is thy first breath, and man's eternal <mark3>prime.</mark3><br>
