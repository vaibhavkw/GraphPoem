Title : Michiko Dead <br>
Author : Jack Gilbert <br><br>

He manages like somebody carrying a <mark4>box</mark4><br>
that is too heavy, first with his arms <br>
underneath. When their strength gives <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
he moves the hands forward, hooking them   <br>
on the corners, pulling the weight <mark4>against</mark4><br>
his chest. He moves his thumbs slightly   <br>
when the fingers begin to tire, and it <mark4>makes</mark4><br>
different muscles take over. <mark4>Afterward,</mark4><br>
he carries it on his shoulder, until the <mark4>blood</mark4><br>
drains out of the arm that is stretched up <br>
to steady the box and the arm goes numb. But now   <br>
the man can hold underneath again, so <mark4>that</mark4><br>
he can go on without ever putting the box down.<br>
