Title : Small Woman on Swallow Street <br>
Author : W. S. Merwin <br><br>

Four feet up, under the <mark3>bruise-blue</mark3><br>
Fingered hat-felt, the eyes begin. The sly <mark4>brim</mark4><br>
Slips over the sky, street after street, and nobody   <br>
Knows, to stop it. It will <mark4>cover</mark4><br>
The whole world, if there is time. Fifty <mark4>years'</mark4><br>
Start in gray the eyes have; you will <mark4>never</mark4><br>
Catch up to where they <mark3>are</mark3>, too <mark3>clever</mark3><br>
And always walking, the legs not long <mark4>but</mark4><br>
The boots big with wide smiles of darkness   <br>
Going round and round at their tops, climbing.   <br>
They are almost to the knees already, <mark4>where</mark4><br>
There should have been ankles to stop <mark4>them.</mark4><br>
So must keep walking all the time, hurry, <mark4>for</mark4><br>
The black sea is down where the toes <mark4>are</mark4><br>
And swallows and swallows all. A big <mark4>coat</mark4><br>
Can help save you. But eyes push you down; <mark1>never</mark1><br>
Meet eyes. There are hands in hands, and love   <br>
Follows its furs into shut doors; <mark3>who</mark3><br>
Shall be killed first? Do not look up <mark4>there:</mark4><br>
The wind is blowing the building-tops, and a hand   <br>
Is sneaking the whole sky another way, <mark1>but</mark1><br>
It will not escape. Do not look up. God <mark4>is</mark4><br>
On High. He can see you. You will die.<br>
