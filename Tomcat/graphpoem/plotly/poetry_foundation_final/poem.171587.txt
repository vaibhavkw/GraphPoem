Title : Retired Ballerinas, Central Park West <br>
Author : Lawrence Ferlinghetti <br><br>

Retired ballerinas on winter <mark4>afternoons</mark4><br>
walking their <mark4>dogs</mark4><br>
                      in Central Park West <br>
(or their cats on <mark4>leashes--</mark4><br>
the cats themselves old highwire <mark4>artists)</mark4><br>
The <mark4>ballerinas</mark4><br>
                leap and pirouette <br>
                           through Columbus Circle   <br>
while winos on park <mark4>benches</mark4><br>
               (laid back like drunken Goudonovs)   <br>
hear the taxis trumpet <mark4>together</mark4><br>
like horsemen of the <mark4>apocalypse</mark4><br>
in the dusk of the <mark4>gods</mark4><br>
It is the final witching <mark4>hour</mark4><br>
when swains are full of swan <mark4>songs</mark4><br>
    And all return through the dark dusk   <br>
to their bright <mark4>cells</mark4><br>
in glass <mark4>highrises</mark4><br>
or sit down to oval cigarettes and <mark4>cakes</mark4><br>
                              in the Russian Tea Room   <br>
or climb four flights to back <mark4>rooms</mark4><br>
                                 in Westside brownstones   <br>
where faded playbill <mark4>photos</mark4><br>
fall peeling from their <mark4>frames</mark4><br>
like last year's autumn <mark4>leaves</mark4><br>
