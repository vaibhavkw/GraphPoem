Author : Edmund Waller <br><br>

Go, lovely <mark3>rose!</mark3><br>
Tell her that wastes her time and <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
That now she <mark3>knows,</mark3><br>
When I resemble her to <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
How sweet and fair she seems to <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
<br>
Tell her that's <mark3>young,</mark3><br>
And shuns to have her graces <mark3>spied,</mark3><br>
That hadst thou <mark3>sprung</mark3><br>
In deserts, where no men <mark3>abide,</mark3><br>
Thou must have uncommended <mark3>died.</mark3><br>
<br>
Small is the <mark4>worth</mark4><br>
Of beauty from the light <mark4>retired;</mark4><br>
Bid her come <mark4>forth,</mark4><br>
Suffer herself to be <mark3>desired,</mark3><br>
And not blush so to be <mark3>admired.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then die! that <mark3>she</mark3><br>
The common fate of all things <mark3>rare</mark3><br>
May read in <mark1>thee;</mark1><br>
How small a part of time they <mark3>share</mark3><br>
That are so wondrous sweet and <mark3>fair!</mark3><br>
