Title : Intrusion <br>
Author : Denise Levertov <br><br>

After I had cut off my <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
and grown new <mark4>ones</mark4><br>
<br>
something my former hands had longed <mark1>for</mark1><br>
came and asked to be rocked. <br>
<br>
After my plucked out <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
had withered, and new ones grown <br>
<br>
something my former eyes had wept <mark1>for</mark1><br>
came asking to be pitied.<br>
