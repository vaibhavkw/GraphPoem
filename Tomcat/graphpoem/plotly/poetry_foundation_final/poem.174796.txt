Title : Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey, On Revisiting the Banks of the Wye during a Tour. July 13, 1798 <br>
Author : William Wordsworth <br><br>

Five years have past; five summers, with the length <br>
Of five long winters! and again I <mark4>hear</mark4><br>
These <mark4>waters</mark4>, rolling from their <mark4>mountain-springs</mark4><br>
With a soft inland murmur.--Once <mark4>again</mark4><br>
Do I behold these steep and lofty <mark4>cliffs,</mark4><br>
That on a wild secluded scene <mark4>impress</mark4><br>
Thoughts of more deep seclusion; and <mark4>connect</mark4><br>
The landscape with the quiet of the <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
The day is come when I again <mark4>repose</mark4><br>
Here, under this dark sycamore, and <mark3>view</mark3><br>
These plots of cottage-ground, these <mark4>orchard-tufts,</mark4><br>
Which at this season, with their unripe <mark4>fruits,</mark4><br>
Are clad in one green hue, and lose <mark4>themselves</mark4><br>
'Mid groves and copses. Once again I <mark5>see</mark5><br>
These <mark4>hedge-rows</mark4>, hardly hedge-rows, little <mark4>lines</mark4><br>
Of sportive wood run wild: these pastoral <mark4>farms,</mark4><br>
Green to the very door; and wreaths of <mark4>smoke</mark4><br>
Sent up, in silence, from among the <mark4>trees!</mark4><br>
With some uncertain notice, as might <mark5>seem</mark5><br>
Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless <mark4>woods,</mark4><br>
Or of some Hermit's cave, where by his <mark4>fire</mark4><br>
The Hermit sits <mark4>alone.</mark4><br>
<br>
These beauteous <mark4>forms,</mark4><br>
Through a long absence, have not been to <mark3>me</mark3><br>
As is a landscape to a blind man's <mark3>eye:</mark3><br>
But oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the <mark4>din</mark4><br>
Of towns and cities, I have owed to <mark4>them,</mark4><br>
In hours of weariness, sensations <mark4>sweet,</mark4><br>
Felt in the blood, and felt along the <mark4>heart;</mark4><br>
And passing even into my purer <mark4>mind</mark4><br>
With tranquil restoration:--feelings <mark3>too</mark3><br>
Of unremembered pleasure: such, <mark4>perhaps,</mark4><br>
As have no slight or trivial <mark4>influence</mark4><br>
On that best portion of a good man's <mark1>life,</mark1><br>
His little, nameless, unremembered, <mark4>acts</mark4><br>
Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I <mark4>trust,</mark4><br>
To them I may have owed another <mark4>gift,</mark4><br>
Of aspect more sublime; that blessed <mark4>mood,</mark4><br>
In which the burthen of the <mark4>mystery,</mark4><br>
In which the heavy and the weary <mark4>weight</mark4><br>
Of all this unintelligible <mark4>world,</mark4><br>
Is lightened:--that serene and blessed <mark1>mood,</mark1><br>
In which the affections gently lead us <mark4>on,--</mark4><br>
Until, the breath of this corporeal <mark4>frame</mark4><br>
And even the motion of our human <mark4>blood</mark4><br>
Almost suspended, we are laid <mark4>asleep</mark4><br>
In body, and become a living <mark4>soul:</mark4><br>
While with an eye made quiet by the <mark4>power</mark4><br>
Of harmony, and the deep power of <mark1>joy,</mark1><br>
We see into the life of <mark4>things.</mark4><br>
<br>
If <mark4>this</mark4><br>
Be but a vain belief, <mark4>yet</mark4>, oh! how <mark4>oft--</mark4><br>
In darkness and amid the many <mark4>shapes</mark4><br>
Of joyless daylight; when the fretful <mark5>stir</mark5><br>
Unprofitable, and the fever of the <mark1>world,</mark1><br>
Have hung upon the beatings of my <mark1>heart--</mark1><br>
How oft, in spirit, have I turned to <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
O sylvan Wye! thou wanderer thro' the <mark1>woods,</mark1><br>
How often has my spirit turned to <mark1>thee!</mark1><br>
<br>
And now, with gleams of half-extinguished <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
With many recognitions dim and <mark4>faint,</mark4><br>
And somewhat of a sad <mark4>perplexity,</mark4><br>
The picture of the mind revives <mark1>again:</mark1><br>
While here I stand, not only with the <mark4>sense</mark4><br>
Of present pleasure, but with pleasing <mark4>thoughts</mark4><br>
That in this moment there is life and <mark4>food</mark4><br>
For future years. And so I dare to <mark4>hope,</mark4><br>
Though changed, no <mark4>doubt</mark4>, from what I was when <mark4>first</mark4><br>
I came among these hills; when like a roe <br>
I bounded o'er the <mark4>mountains</mark4>, by the <mark4>sides</mark4><br>
Of the deep <mark4>rivers</mark4>, and the lonely <mark4>streams,</mark4><br>
Wherever nature led: more like a <mark4>man</mark4><br>
Flying from something that he dreads, than <mark4>one</mark4><br>
Who sought the thing he loved. For nature <mark4>then</mark4><br>
(The coarser pleasures of my boyish <mark4>days</mark4><br>
And their glad animal movements all gone <mark3>by)</mark3><br>
To me was all in all.--I cannot <mark4>paint</mark4><br>
What then I was. The sounding <mark4>cataract</mark4><br>
Haunted me like a passion: the tall <mark4>rock,</mark4><br>
The mountain, and the deep and gloomy <mark4>wood,</mark4><br>
Their colours and their forms, were then to <mark1>me</mark1><br>
An appetite; a feeling and a <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
That had no need of a remoter <mark4>charm,</mark4><br>
By thought supplied, not any <mark4>interest</mark4><br>
Unborrowed from the eye.--That time is <mark4>past,</mark4><br>
And all its aching joys are now no <mark4>more,</mark4><br>
And all its dizzy raptures. Not for <mark1>this</mark1><br>
Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur; other <mark4>gifts</mark4><br>
Have followed; for such loss, I would <mark4>believe,</mark4><br>
Abundant recompense. For I have <mark4>learned</mark4><br>
To look on <mark4>nature</mark4>, not as in the <mark4>hour</mark4><br>
Of thoughtless youth; but hearing <mark4>oftentimes</mark4><br>
The still sad music of <mark4>humanity,</mark4><br>
Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample <mark1>power</mark1><br>
To chasten and subdue.--And I have <mark4>felt</mark4><br>
A presence that disturbs me with the <mark1>joy</mark1><br>
Of elevated thoughts; a sense <mark4>sublime</mark4><br>
Of something far more deeply <mark5>interfused,</mark5><br>
Whose dwelling is the light of setting <mark4>suns,</mark4><br>
And the round ocean and the living <mark4>air,</mark4><br>
And the blue sky, and in the mind of <mark1>man:</mark1><br>
A motion and a spirit, that <mark5>impels</mark5><br>
All thinking things, all objects of all <mark1>thought,</mark1><br>
And rolls through all things. Therefore am I <mark4>still</mark4><br>
A lover of the meadows and the <mark1>woods</mark1><br>
And mountains; and of all that we <mark4>behold</mark4><br>
From this green earth; of all the mighty <mark1>world</mark1><br>
Of eye, and ear,--both what they half <mark4>create,</mark4><br>
And what perceive; well pleased to <mark4>recognise</mark4><br>
In nature and the language of the <mark1>sense</mark1><br>
The anchor of my purest <mark4>thoughts</mark4>, the <mark4>nurse,</mark4><br>
The guide, the guardian of my heart, and <mark1>soul</mark1><br>
Of all my moral <mark4>being.</mark4><br>
<br>
Nor <mark4>perchance,</mark4><br>
If I were not thus taught, should I the <mark1>more</mark1><br>
Suffer my genial spirits to <mark3>decay:</mark3><br>
For thou art with me here upon the <mark4>banks</mark4><br>
Of this fair river; thou my dearest <mark4>Friend,</mark4><br>
My dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I <mark5>catch</mark5><br>
The language of my former heart, and <mark4>read</mark4><br>
My former pleasures in the shooting <mark4>lights</mark4><br>
Of thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little <mark4>while</mark4><br>
May I behold in thee what I was <mark4>once,</mark4><br>
My dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I <mark4>make,</mark4><br>
Knowing that Nature never did <mark3>betray</mark3><br>
The heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege, <br>
Through all the years of this our life, to <mark3>lead</mark3><br>
From joy to joy: for she can so <mark4>inform</mark4><br>
The mind that is within <mark3>us</mark3>, so <mark1>impress</mark1><br>
With quietness and beauty, and so <mark3>feed</mark3><br>
With lofty thoughts, that neither evil <mark4>tongues,</mark4><br>
Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish <mark4>men,</mark4><br>
Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor <mark4>all</mark4><br>
The dreary intercourse of daily <mark1>life,</mark1><br>
Shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb <br>
Our cheerful faith, that all which we <mark1>behold</mark1><br>
Is full of blessings. Therefore let the <mark4>moon</mark4><br>
Shine on thee in thy solitary <mark4>walk;</mark4><br>
And let the misty mountain-winds be <mark3>free</mark3><br>
To blow against thee: and, in after <mark4>years,</mark4><br>
When these wild ecstasies shall be <mark4>matured</mark4><br>
Into a sober pleasure; when thy <mark1>mind</mark1><br>
Shall be a mansion for all lovely <mark1>forms,</mark1><br>
Thy memory be as a <mark4>dwelling-place</mark4><br>
For all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! <mark1>then,</mark1><br>
If solitude, or fear, or pain, or <mark4>grief,</mark4><br>
Should be thy portion, with what healing <mark1>thoughts</mark1><br>
Of tender joy wilt thou remember <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
And these my exhortations! Nor, <mark1>perchance--</mark1><br>
If I should be where I no more can <mark1>hear</mark1><br>
Thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these <mark4>gleams</mark4><br>
Of past existence--wilt thou then <mark4>forget</mark4><br>
That on the banks of this delightful <mark4>stream</mark4><br>
We stood together; and that I, so <mark4>long</mark4><br>
A worshipper of Nature, hither <mark4>came</mark4><br>
Unwearied in that service: rather <mark3>say</mark3><br>
With warmer love--oh! with far deeper <mark4>zeal</mark4><br>
Of holier love. Nor wilt thou then <mark1>forget,</mark1><br>
That after many <mark4>wanderings</mark4>, many <mark1>years</mark1><br>
Of <mark4>absence</mark4>, these steep woods and lofty <mark1>cliffs,</mark1><br>
And this green pastoral landscape, were to <mark1>me</mark1><br>
More dear, both for themselves and for thy <mark4>sake!</mark4><br>
