Title : The Amenities <br>
Author : Heather McHugh <br><br>

I owe you an <mark4>explanation.</mark4><br>
My first memory isn't your <mark4>own</mark4><br>
of an empty box. My babyhood cabinets <mark4>held</mark4><br>
a countlessness of cakes, my <mark4>backyard</mark4><br>
rotted into apple glut, windfalls <mark4>of</mark4><br>
money-tree, mouthfuls of fib. <br>
<br>
At puberty I liked the <mark4>locks,</mark4><br>
I was the one who made them <mark4>fast.</mark4><br>
The yelling in our hallways was <mark4>about</mark4><br>
lost money, or lost love, but <mark4>not</mark4><br>
lost life. Or so I see it now:   <br>
in those days I <mark4>romanticized</mark4><br>
a risk (I thought I'd <mark1>die</mark1><br>
in the alcoholic automobile, <mark1>die</mark1><br>
at the hands of nerveless dentistry). Small <mark4>hearts</mark4><br>
were printed in the checkbook; when my parents called <mark1>me</mark1><br>
dear, they meant <mark4>expensive.</mark4><br>
<br>
Where were you in all that time? Out looking <mark1>for</mark1><br>
your father's body? Making for your mother's room?   <br>
I got my A's in English, <mark4>civics,</mark4><br>
sweetness and light; you got black eyes, and <mark4>F's,</mark4><br>
and nowhere <mark4>fast</mark4>, By 1967 when we <mark4>met</mark4><br>
(if you could call it making an <mark4>acquaintance,</mark4><br>
rape) I was a mal-adjusted gush, a sucker <mark1>for</mark1><br>
placebos. Walking home from Central Square, I came to <mark4>have</mark4><br>
the good girl's petty dread: the <mark4>woman</mark4><br>
<br>
to whose yard you dragged me <mark4>might</mark4><br>
detect us, and be <mark4>furious</mark4>, More than anything <mark4>else</mark4><br>
I wanted no one mad at me. (Propriety, <br>
or was it property, I <mark4>thought</mark4><br>
to guard: myself I gave away.) <br>
<br>
And as for you, you had the <mark4>shakes,</mark4><br>
were barely seventeen yourself, too raw   <br>
to get it up (I said don't be <mark4>afraid,</mark4><br>
afraid of what might happen if you <mark4>failed).</mark4><br>
And afterwards, in one of those <mark4>moments</mark4><br>
it's hard to tell (funny from fatal) you <mark4>did</mark4><br>
a terrible civility: you told <mark1>me</mark1><br>
<br>
thanks. I'll never <mark4>forget</mark4><br>
that moment all my <mark3>life.</mark3><br>
It wasn't until then, as you <br>
were sheathing it to <mark4>run,</mark4><br>
<br>
I saw the <mark3>knife.</mark3><br>
