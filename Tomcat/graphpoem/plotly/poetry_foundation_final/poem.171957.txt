Title : Amor Vincit Omnia <br>
Author : Edgar Bowers <br><br>

Love is no <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
It died as the mind dies: the pure desire <br>
Relinquishing the blissful form it <mark3>wore,</mark3><br>
The ample joy and clarity <mark4>expire.</mark4><br>
<br>
Regret is <mark3>vain.</mark3><br>
Then do not grieve for what you would <mark3>efface,</mark3><br>
The sudden failure of the past, the <mark3>pain</mark3><br>
Of its unwilling change, and the <mark3>disgrace.</mark3><br>
<br>
Leave <mark4>innocence,</mark4><br>
And modify your nature by the <mark3>grief</mark3><br>
Which poses to the will <mark4>indifference</mark4><br>
That no desire is permanent in <mark4>sense.</mark4><br>
<br>
Take leave of me.<br>
What recompense, or pity, or <mark3>deceit</mark3><br>
Can cure, or what assumed serenity <br>
Conceal the mortal loss which we <mark3>repeat?</mark3><br>
<br>
The mind will change, and change shall be <mark3>relief.</mark3><br>
