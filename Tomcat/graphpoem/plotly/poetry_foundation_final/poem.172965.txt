Title : A Reminiscence <br>
Author : Anne Bronte <br><br>

YES, thou art gone! and never <mark3>more</mark3><br>
Thy sunny smile shall gladden <mark3>me;</mark3><br>
But I may pass the old church <mark3>door,</mark3><br>
And pace the floor that covers <mark3>thee.</mark3><br>
<br>
May stand upon the cold, damp <mark3>stone,</mark3><br>
And think that, frozen, lies <mark3>below</mark3><br>
The lightest heart that I have <mark3>known,</mark3><br>
The kindest I shall ever <mark3>know.</mark3><br>
<br>
Yet, though I cannot see thee <mark1>more,</mark1><br>
'Tis still a comfort to have <mark4>seen;</mark4><br>
And though thy transient life is o'er,<br>
'Tis sweet to think that thou hast <mark4>been;</mark4><br>
<br>
To think a soul so near <mark4>divine,</mark4><br>
Within a form so angel <mark4>fair,</mark4><br>
United to a heart like <mark3>thine,</mark3><br>
Has gladdened once our humble <mark4>sphere.</mark4><br>
