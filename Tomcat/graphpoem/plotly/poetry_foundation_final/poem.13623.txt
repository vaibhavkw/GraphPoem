Title : Encounter<br>
Author : Thomas McGrath<br><br>

At two thousand feet the sea wrinkles like an old man's <mark4>hand.</mark4><br>
Closer, in a monotone of peristalsis,<br>
Its fugue-like swells create and <mark4>recreate</mark4><br>
One image in an idiot <mark4>concentration.</mark4><br>
<br>
From horizon to horizon, this <mark4>desert</mark4><br>
With the eye athirst for something stable <br>
When off to <mark4>southeast-ward--</mark4><br>
It was a plane all right, or had <mark4>been,</mark4><br>
A shipside fighter, her pontoons floated her. <br>
Smashed like a match-case, no one could be <mark4>sure</mark4><br>
If it were ours or had been one of <mark4>theirs.</mark4><br>
<br>
That's all there was. A thousand miles <mark4>anywhere</mark4><br>
There was only the north ocean, the poleward pallor, <br>
Like a desolation of spirit, lonelier than <mark4>god.</mark4><br>
What did it mean? They thought of night <mark4>fleets</mark4><br>
In the ghostly boreal dark or maybe<br>
Toy cardboard silhouettes in the bleak limbo of <mark4>noon:</mark4><br>
The salvos wink in bloom at twenty <mark4>miles,</mark4><br>
The pause, the roar like a night <mark4>freight</mark4><br>
And the near misses building their faery <mark4>forests.</mark4><br>
<br>
Where were these giants? The sea <mark4>offered</mark4><br>
A single clue, a symbol; no <mark4>explanation.</mark4><br>
Northward the fog banks thickened and on all <mark4>horizons</mark4><br>
As if jealous of giving up secured <mark4>positions</mark4><br>
The night stirred angrily like an old <mark4>suspicion.</mark4><br>
