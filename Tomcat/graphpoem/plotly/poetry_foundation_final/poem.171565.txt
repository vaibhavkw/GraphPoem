Title : The Rescue <br>
Author : Robert Creeley <br><br>

The man sits in a <mark5>timelessness</mark5><br>
with the horse under him in <mark5>time</mark5><br>
to a movement of legs and hooves   <br>
upon a timeless <mark4>sand.</mark4><br>
<br>
Distance comes in from the <mark4>foreground</mark4><br>
present in the picture as <mark1>time</mark1><br>
he reads outward <mark4>from</mark4><br>
and comes from that <mark4>beginning.</mark4><br>
<br>
A wind blows <mark4>in</mark4><br>
and out and all about the <mark4>man</mark4><br>
as the horse <mark3>ran</mark3><br>
and runs to come in <mark1>time.</mark1><br>
<br>
A house is burning in the <mark1>sand.</mark1><br>
A man and horse are <mark4>burning.</mark4><br>
The wind is <mark1>burning.</mark1><br>
They are running to arrive.<br>
