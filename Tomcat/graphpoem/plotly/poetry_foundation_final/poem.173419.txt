Title : Idea 6: How many paltry, foolish, painted things <br>
Author : Michael Drayton <br><br>

<br>
How many paltry, foolish, painted <mark3>things,</mark3><br>
That now in coaches trouble every <mark3>street,</mark3><br>
Shall be forgotten, whom no poet <mark3>sings,</mark3><br>
Ere they be well wrapp'd in their <mark3>winding-sheet?</mark3><br>
Where I to thee eternity shall <mark3>give,</mark3><br>
When nothing else remaineth of these <mark4>days,</mark4><br>
And queens hereafter shall be glad to <mark3>live</mark3><br>
Upon the alms of thy superfluous <mark3>praise.</mark3><br>
Virgins and matrons reading these my <mark4>rhymes</mark4><br>
Shall be so much delighted with thy <mark3>story,</mark3><br>
That they shall grieve they liv'd not in these <mark3>times</mark3><br>
To have seen thee, their sex's only <mark3>glory.</mark3><br>
So shalt thou fly above the vulgar <mark3>throng,</mark3><br>
Still to survive in my immortal <mark3>song.</mark3><br>
