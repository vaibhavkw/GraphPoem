Title : To the Returned Girls <br>
Author : Franklin Pierce Adams <br><br>

Will you read my little pome, <br>
O you girls returned <mark4>home</mark4><br>
From a summertime of <mark3>sport</mark3><br>
At the Jolliest <mark3>Resort,</mark3><br>
From a Heated Term of <mark3>joys</mark3><br>
Far from urban dust and <mark3>noise?</mark3><br>
<br>
You I speak to in this <mark4>rhyme,</mark4><br>
You have had a Glorious <mark3>Time</mark3><br>
Swimming, golfing, <mark4>bridging</mark4>, <mark4>dancing,</mark4><br>
Riding, tennising, <mark3>romancing,</mark3><br>
On the springboard, on the <mark4>raft--</mark4><br>
You've been often <mark4>photographed.</mark4><br>
<br>
At the place you have <mark3>forsaken,</mark3><br>
You have had some pictures <mark3>taken,</mark3><br>
Pictures taken of you <mark1>dancing,</mark1><br>
Riding, tennising, <mark1>romancing,</mark1><br>
Swimming, <mark4>golfing</mark4>, and <mark4>reclining;</mark4><br>
Snacking, luncheoning, and <mark3>dining.</mark3><br>
<br>
Cometh now my brief <mark3>advice;</mark3><br>
Ladies, be ye ne'er so <mark3>nice,</mark3><br>
Be ye ne'er so <mark4>fascinating,</mark4><br>
Luring, <mark4>drawing</mark4>, <mark3>captivating,</mark3><br>
If with interest you'd imbue <mark4>us,</mark4><br>
Do not show those pictures to <mark1>us!</mark1><br>
<br>
Snapshots of the links and <mark4>lawn</mark4><br>
Cause in many of us a <mark3>yawn;</mark3><br>
(As for me myself, why, <mark3>I'm</mark3><br>
Glad to see 'em any <mark1>time)</mark1><br>
But--I give it to you <mark3>square--</mark3><br>
Lots of people do not <mark3>care.</mark3><br>
