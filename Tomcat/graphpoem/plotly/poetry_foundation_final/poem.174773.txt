Author : William Carlos Williams <br><br>

All the complicated <mark4>details</mark4><br>
of the attiring <mark4>and</mark4><br>
the disattiring are <mark4>completed!</mark4><br>

moves gently among <br>
the long <mark4>branches.</mark4><br>
Thus having prepared their <mark4>buds</mark4><br>
against a sure winter <br>
the wise <mark4>trees</mark4><br>
stand sleeping in the <mark4>cold.</mark4><br>
