Title : Native Trees <br>
Author : W. S. Merwin <br><br>

Neither my father nor my mother <mark1>knew</mark1><br>
the names of the <mark4>trees</mark4><br>
where I was <mark4>born</mark4><br>
what is <mark4>that</mark4><br>
I asked and my <br>
father and mother did <mark4>not</mark4><br>
hear they did not look where I <mark4>pointed</mark4><br>
surfaces of furniture <mark4>held</mark4><br>
the attention of their <mark4>fingers</mark4><br>
and across the room they could watch <br>
walls they had <mark4>forgotten</mark4><br>
where there were no <mark4>questions</mark4><br>
no voices and no <mark4>shade</mark4><br>
<br>
Were there <mark1>trees</mark1><br>
where they were <mark4>children</mark4><br>
where I had not <mark4>been</mark4><br>
I <mark4>asked</mark4><br>
were there trees in those <mark4>places</mark4><br>
where my father and my mother were <mark1>born</mark1><br>
and in that time <mark4>did</mark4><br>
my father and my mother see <mark5>them</mark5><br>
and when they said yes it <mark4>meant</mark4><br>
they did not <mark4>remember</mark4><br>
What were they I asked what were <mark5>they</mark5><br>
but both my father and my <mark4>mother</mark4><br>
said they never <mark1>knew</mark1><br>
