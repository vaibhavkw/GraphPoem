Title : The Wood-Pile <br>
Author : Robert Frost <br><br>

Out walking in the frozen swamp one gray <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
I paused and said, 'I will turn back from <mark1>here.</mark1><br>
No, I will go on farther--and we shall <mark1>see.'</mark1><br>
The hard snow held me, save where now and <mark4>then</mark4><br>
One foot went through. The view was all in <mark4>lines</mark4><br>
Straight up and down of tall slim <mark4>trees</mark4><br>
Too much alike to mark or name a place by<br>
So as to say for certain I was <mark1>here</mark1><br>
Or somewhere else: I was just far from <mark4>home.</mark4><br>
A small bird flew before me. He was <mark4>careful</mark4><br>
To put a tree between us when he <mark4>lighted,</mark4><br>
And say no word to tell me who he <mark4>was</mark4><br>
Who was so foolish as to think what he <mark4>thought.</mark4><br>
He thought that I was after him for a <mark5>feather--</mark5><br>
The white one in his tail; like one who <mark4>takes</mark4><br>
Everything said as personal to <mark5>himself.</mark5><br>
One flight out sideways would have undeceived <mark4>him.</mark4><br>
And then there was a pile of wood for <mark1>which</mark1><br>
I forgot him and let his little <mark4>fear</mark4><br>
Carry him off the way I might have <mark4>gone,</mark4><br>
Without so much as wishing him <mark4>good-night.</mark4><br>
He went behind it to make his last <mark4>stand.</mark4><br>
It was a cord of maple, cut and <mark4>split</mark4><br>
And piled--and measured, four by four by <mark4>eight.</mark4><br>
And not another like it could I <mark1>see.</mark1><br>
No runner tracks in this year's snow looped near <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
And it was older sure than this year's cutting,<br>
Or even last year's or the year's <mark4>before.</mark4><br>
The wood was gray and the bark warping off <mark1>it</mark1><br>
And the pile somewhat sunken. <mark4>Clematis</mark4><br>
Had wound strings round and round it like a <mark4>bundle.</mark4><br>
What held it though on one side was a <mark3>tree</mark3><br>
Still growing, and on one a stake and prop,<br>
These latter about to fall. I thought that only<br>
Someone who lived in turning to fresh <mark4>tasks</mark4><br>
Could so forget his handiwork on <mark1>which</mark1><br>
He spent himself, the labor of his <mark4>ax,</mark4><br>
And leave it there far from a useful <mark4>fireplace</mark4><br>
To warm the frozen swamp as best it <mark4>could</mark4><br>
With the slow smokeless burning of <mark3>decay.</mark3><br>
