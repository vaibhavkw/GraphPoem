Title : After Making Love We Hear Footsteps <br>
Author : Galway Kinnell <br><br>

For I can snore like a <mark4>bullhorn</mark4><br>
or play loud <mark4>music</mark4><br>
or sit up talking with any reasonably sober <mark4>Irishman</mark4><br>
and Fergus will only sink <mark4>deeper</mark4><br>
into his dreamless sleep, which goes by all in one flash,   <br>
but let there be that heavy <mark4>breathing</mark4><br>
or a stifled come-cry anywhere in the house <br>
and he will wrench himself <mark4>awake</mark4><br>
and make for it on the run--as now, we lie <mark4>together,</mark4><br>
after making love, quiet, touching along the length of our <mark4>bodies,</mark4><br>
familiar touch of the <mark4>long-married,</mark4><br>
and he appears--in his baseball <mark4>pajamas</mark4>, it <mark4>happens,</mark4><br>
the neck opening so small he has to screw them <mark4>on--</mark4><br>
and flops down between us and hugs us and snuggles himself to sleep, <br>
his face gleaming with satisfaction at being this very <mark4>child.</mark4><br>
<br>
In the half darkness we look at each <mark4>other</mark4><br>
and smile <br>
and touch arms across this little, startlingly muscled <mark5>body--</mark5><br>
this one whom habit of memory propels to the ground of his <mark4>making,</mark4><br>
sleeper only the mortal sounds can sing <mark1>awake,</mark1><br>
this blessing love gives again into our <mark4>arms.</mark4><br>
