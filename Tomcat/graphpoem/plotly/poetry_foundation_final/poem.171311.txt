Part Four of "Pro <mark4>Femina"</mark4><br>
At Samoa, hardly unpacked, I commenced <mark4>planting,</mark4><br>
When I'd opened the chicken crates, built the Cochins a <mark3>coop.</mark3><br>
The Reverend Mr. Claxton <mark4>called</mark4>, found me covered with <mark4>mud,</mark4><br>
My clothes torn, my hair in a wad, my bare feet <mark4>bleeding.</mark4><br>
I had started the buffalo grass in the new-made <mark4>clearing.</mark4><br>
The next day the priest paid a visit. Civil but <mark4>restless,</mark4><br>
I was dying to plant the alfalfa seed--gave him a <mark4>packet.</mark4><br>
<br>
That evening I paced up and down, dropping melon <mark4>seeds,</mark4><br>
Tomatoes and bush lima beans here and <mark4>there</mark4><br>
Where I thought they would grow. We were short of food <mark3>now,</mark3><br>
So I cooked up a mess of fat little parrots, <mark4>disturbed</mark4><br>
At the way they suggested cages and swings and stands <mark4>...</mark4><br>
An excellent meal. I have been told the dodo survived <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
And yearn for a pet on a string. And I built the <mark4>pig-house.</mark4><br>
<br>
I had brought sweet coconut seed from Savage <mark4>Island.</mark4><br>
I planted kidney potatoes in small earthen <mark4>hills.</mark4><br>
Sowed seeds of eggplant in numerous boxes of <mark4>soil,</mark4><br>
Tomato and artichoke too; half-a-dozen fine <mark4>pineapple</mark4><br>
Sent over by Mr. Carruthers, the island <mark4>solicitor.</mark4><br>
As fast as we eat them, we plant the <mark4>tops.</mark4><br>
The kitchen a shack near the house. I made bread in the <mark4>rain.</mark4><br>
<br>
October, 1890. I have been here nearly a <mark4>month;</mark4><br>
Put in corn, peas, onions, radishes, lettuce. Lima <mark4>beans</mark4><br>
Are already coming up. The ripening cantaloupe were <mark4>stolen.</mark4><br>
Carruthers gave me mint root and grenadilla <br>
Like a bouquet; he delivered a load of <mark4>trees,</mark4><br>
Two mangoes among them. I set them out in a heavy <mark1>rain,</mark1><br>
Then rounded off the afternoon sowing Indian <mark4>corn.</mark4><br>
<br>
Louis has called me a peasant. How I <mark4>brooded!</mark4><br>
Confided it to you, diary, then crossed it <mark4>out.</mark4><br>
Peasant because I delve in the earth, the earth I <mark4>own.</mark4><br>
Confiding my seed and root--I too a <mark4>creator?</mark4><br>
My heart melts over a bed of young peas. A <mark4>blossom</mark4><br>
On the rose tree is like a poem by my <mark4>son.</mark4><br>
My hurt healed by its cause, I go on <mark1>planting.</mark1><br>
<br>
No one else works much. The natives take it <mark4>easy;</mark4><br>
The colonials keep their shops, and a shortage of <mark4>customers.</mark4><br>
The mail comes four times a month, and the gossip all <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
The bars are crowded with amateur <mark4>politicians,</mark4><br>
Office-seekers I named the earwig consul and <mark4>king:</mark4><br>
Big talkers, with small-time conspirators drinking them <mark4>in.</mark4><br>
Mr. Carruthers and I picked a site for the kitchen <mark4>garden.</mark4><br>
<br>
I was planting a new lot of corn and <mark4>pumpkin</mark4><br>
When a young chief arrived, laden with pineapple <mark4>plants.</mark4><br>
I set them out as I talked to him on the way <mark4>home.</mark4><br>
Rats and a wild hen ate the <mark4>corn</mark4>, Lettuce got too much <mark4>sun.</mark4><br>
So I dug a new patch up the road; in the fragrant <mark4>evening</mark4><br>
I confided to Louis, a puff of the sweetest <mark4>scent</mark4><br>
Blows back as I cast away a handful of so-called <mark4>weeds!</mark4><br>
<br>
It still hurts, his remark that I have the soul of a <mark4>peasant.</mark4><br>
My vanity, like a newly felled tree, lies prone and <mark1>bleeding.</mark1><br>
I clear the weeds near the house for planting <mark4>maize.</mark4><br>
Sweet corn and peas are showing. I send for more <mark1>seeds.</mark1><br>
I clean out the <mark4>potatoes</mark4>, which had rotted in their <mark1>hills.</mark1><br>
Of course, RLS is not idle; he is writing A Footnote to <mark4>History:</mark4><br>
How the great powers combine to carve up these <mark4>islands.</mark4><br>
<br>
I discovered the ylang-ylang tree: a base for <mark4>perfume,</mark4><br>
Though it suggested to me the odor of <mark4>boots.</mark4><br>
Another tree is scented like pepper and <mark4>spice,</mark4><br>
And one terrible tree, I am forced to <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
Smells like ordure ... It nearly made me <mark4>ill.</mark4><br>
Breadfruit is plentiful. I found a banana <mark5>grove,</mark5><br>
Began clearing it <mark4>instantly</mark4>, and worked till I was <mark4>dizzy.</mark4><br>
<br>
The garden looks like a graveyard: beds shaped like <mark4>tombs.</mark4><br>
I plant cabbage which I loathe, so the British won't tease <mark3>me</mark3><br>
For not growing it. But behold! in the hedge <br>
Among citron and lime, many lemon trees, in full <mark4>bearing.</mark4><br>
Still, I will fall to brooding before the <mark4>mirror,</mark4><br>
Though Louis says he finds the peasant class <mark4>"interesting."</mark4><br>
He is forty today. I am ten years his <mark4>senior.</mark4><br>
<br>
On the cleared land, the green <mark4>mummy-apple,</mark4><br>
Male and female, is springing up <mark4>everywhere.</mark4><br>
I discover wild ginger, turmeric, something like <mark4>sugar.</mark4><br>
Roots of orange, breadfruit and <mark4>mango</mark4>, seeds of <mark4>cacao</mark4><br>
Came with a shipment from Sydney; also <mark4>eleven</mark4><br>
Young navel orange trees. The strawberry plants are <mark4>rotten.</mark4><br>
I am given a handful of bees. I plant more <mark1>pineapple.</mark1><br>
<br>
All fall I am cursed with asthma, rheumatics, a painful <mark4>ear.</mark4><br>
Christmas. A <mark4>hurricane</mark4>, And the New Year <mark4>begins.</mark4><br>
Louis describes it divinely to Henry <mark4>James.</mark4><br>
Mr. Carruthers' gift pineapple starts to <mark4>fruit.</mark4><br>
I set out one precious rhubarb <mark4>plant</mark4>, pause to <mark4>gloat</mark4><br>
At the ripe <mark4>tomatoes</mark4>, the flourishing long-podded <mark1>beans.</mark1><br>
But the neighbors' horses break in and trample the <mark1>corn.</mark1><br>
<br>
Sometimes, when planting, a strange subterranean <mark4>rumble</mark4><br>
--Volcanic?--vexes the earth beneath this peasant haunch. <br>
I rise up from my furrow, knuckle smooth my <mark3>brow</mark3><br>
As I sniff the air, suddenly chemical, a sulphurous <mark3>fume.</mark3><br>
Louis insisted on going to Sydney, fell ill <mark4>again.</mark4><br>
His mother comes back with him, finds me on my <mark4>knees.</mark4><br>
The old lady's heart leaps! Alas, I am <mark4>planting</mark4>, not <mark4>praying.</mark4><br>
<br>
We both rise at five-thirty, after dreaming of <mark1>weeds.</mark1><br>
Louis describes to me endless vivid deeps: <br>
Dreams of <mark4>nettle-stings</mark4>, stabs from the citron's <mark4>thorns,</mark4><br>
The ants' fiery bites, the resistance of mud and <mark4>slime,</mark4><br>
The evasions of wormy roots, the dead weight of <mark4>heat</mark4><br>
In the sudden puffs of air ... Louis writes till <mark4>nine,</mark4><br>
Then if he's well enough, he helps with the <mark4>weeding.</mark4><br>
<br>
He writes Colvin, keeper of prints at the British <mark4>Museum,</mark4><br>
"I know pleasure still ... with a thousand <mark4>faces,</mark4><br>
None perfect, a thousand tongues, all <mark4>broken,</mark4><br>
A thousand <mark4>hands</mark4>, all with scratching nails <mark4>...</mark4><br>
High among joys, I place this delight of <mark1>weeding,</mark1><br>
Out here alone by the garrulous water, under the <mark4>silence</mark4><br>
Of the high wind, broken by sounds of <mark4>birds."</mark4><br>
<br>
The shock of bird-calls, laughing and <mark4>whistling!</mark4><br>
They mimic his name till it <mark4>seems</mark4>, he <mark4>says,</mark4><br>
"The birds re-live the business of my <mark1>day."</mark1><br>
But the rain continues to fall on birds and <mark1>weeds.</mark1><br>
The new servants fooled around with the ice <mark4>machine</mark4><br>
As the house leaked and listed. Mildew spread its <mark4>failure.</mark4><br>
Mrs. S. gave me some nuts, and went back to <mark4>Australia.</mark4><br>
<br>
Green peppers, eggplant, tomatoes are <mark4>flourishing,</mark4><br>
Asparagus also. The celery does to season <mark3>soup.</mark3><br>
Avocados grow at a rate that is almost <mark4>frightening.</mark4><br>
Coconuts too. I read about Stanley and <mark4>Livingstone.</mark4><br>
I cured my five ulcers with calomel, wished I could <mark4>tell</mark4><br>
Stanley the remedy. Instead, I made <mark1>perfume.</mark1><br>
The servants feared devils, so I planted the orange grove <mark4>alone.</mark4><br>
<br>
For two months I misplaced this diary <mark4>...</mark4><br>
War is in the air, talk of killing all <mark4>whites.</mark4><br>
I bought coffee <mark4>trees</mark4>, rose trees, and Indian <mark1>beans,</mark1><br>
Then went to Fiji to rest, and to get more <mark1>seeds</mark1><br>
From a former Kew gardener. An Indian in a <mark4>shop</mark4><br>
Told me how to raise Persian melon and <mark4>cauliflower</mark4><br>
And a radish that turns into a turnip when it grows <mark4>up.</mark4><br>
<br>
I came home to a burgeoning world: cacao, custard squash.   <br>
The new house was finished, and painted peacock <mark3>blue.</mark3><br>
The jealous old cat bit off the new cat's <mark4>toes.</mark4><br>
My mother-in-law returned with her Bible and lady's <mark4>maid;</mark4><br>
My daughter, her family, and my son Lloyd came <mark3>too.</mark3><br>
The relatives had a terrible row. Mrs. S. <mark4>refused</mark4><br>
To pray with the servants. I threw up my <mark4>hands!</mark4><br>
<br>
My diary entries grow farther and farther <mark4>apart.</mark4><br>
I wrote life was a strain. Later, someone crossed it <mark1>out.</mark1><br>
In pain again, from an aneurysm inside my head <mark4>...</mark4><br>
I planted more and more cacao, and a form of cherry <mark3>tree,</mark3><br>
Tobacco and rubber, taught how by Mr. Sketchley.   <br>
I planted more cacao through an epidemic of 'flu. <br>
Three hundred seeds in baskets broke through the <mark4>ground.</mark4><br>
<br>
I get almost no time to write. I have been planting <mark1>...</mark1><br>
Four kinds of cabbage are doing very <mark3>well.</mark3><br>
Mr. Haggard, the land commissioner, come to <mark4>dine,</mark4><br>
Points out a weed which makes excellent <mark4>eating</mark4><br>
Cooked like asparagus. I shall try it very <mark4>soon.</mark4><br>
Now, when the Reverend Mr. Claxton comes to <mark4>call,</mark4><br>
I refuse to see him. I am tired of the Claxtons. <br>
<br>
The political situation grows grim. I rage at <mark4>Louis</mark4><br>
Who toasts, "Her Blessed Majesty the Queen," then <mark4>aggressively</mark4><br>
Throbbing, turns to my American <mark1>son</mark1><br>
To say he may drink to the President <mark4>afterward</mark4><br>
If he likes. I am writing this <mark4>down</mark4><br>
Hoping Louis will see it later, and be <mark4>ashamed</mark4><br>
Of his childishness and bad <mark3>taste</mark3>, (This will be <mark4>erased.)</mark4><br>
<br>
Because war is near, the Germans stop growing <mark1>cacao.</mark1><br>
Captain Hufnagel offers me all the seeds I can <mark4>use.</mark4><br>
So now we are blazing with cacao <mark4>fever,</mark4><br>
The whole family infected. Six hundred plants set <mark1>out!</mark1><br>
The verandah tracked with mud, and the cacao <mark4>litter.</mark4><br>
Mrs. S. upset by the mess. Twelve hundred cacaos <mark4>planted.</mark4><br>
Joe, my son-in-law, planted his thousandth tree <mark3>today.</mark3><br>
<br>
The tree onions make large bulbs but don't want to <mark4>seed.</mark4><br>
Most vigorous: sunflower, watermelon--weeds! <br>
The jelly from berries out of the bush is <mark4>delicious;</mark4><br>
Lovely perfume from massoi, citron, vanilla, and <mark4>gum.</mark4><br>
The peanuts are weeded while Joe plays on his <mark4>flute.</mark4><br>
I plant cabbage by moonlight, set out more <mark1>cacao.</mark1><br>
The heart of a death's-head moth beats a tattoo in my <mark4>hand.</mark4><br>
<br>
Planted coffee all day, and breadfruit, five beauties <mark4>...</mark4><br>
Planted coffee the better part of the day, eight <mark1>plants.</mark1><br>
In the nursery, three times that <mark4>many</mark4>, Planted coffee <mark4>...</mark4><br>
Painted the storm shutters. Planted coffee all <mark4>morning.</mark4><br>
I found a heap of old bones in a bush near the sty; <br>
Two heads and a body: a warrior died with his <mark4>prize.</mark4><br>
Louis gave the bones a funeral and a <mark4>burial.</mark4><br>
<br>
A series of hurricanes: Louis writes to The <mark4>Times</mark4><br>
Of "the foul colonial politics." I send to New York for <mark1>seeds:</mark1><br>
Southern Cross cabbage, eggplant, sweet potato <br>
And two thousand custard apples. Louis' own <mark1>seed,</mark1><br>
David Balfour, is <mark4>growing</mark4>, I wrote <mark4>nothing</mark4><br>
From June till the end of this year; too busy <mark1>planting.</mark1><br>
The Samoan princes are getting nearer to <mark4>war.</mark4><br>
<br>
It pains me to write this: my son-in-law has gone <mark4>native</mark4><br>
In a spectacular way. Belle is divorcing <mark4>him.</mark4><br>
Austin, my grandson, is in school in <mark3>Monterey.</mark3><br>
I have not, I believe, mentioned Mrs. Stevenson <mark4>recently.</mark4><br>
She has gone back to Scotland. The first breadfruit <mark3>bore.</mark3><br>
Belle and I go on sketching <mark4>expeditions</mark4><br>
To the hostile Samoan camps, stop in town for ginger <mark4>beer.</mark4><br>
<br>
Mr. Haggard begged us to stay in <mark3>town</mark3><br>
Because he bitterly wanted women to <mark4>protect.</mark4><br>
I suggested to him that I and my <mark4>daughter</mark4><br>
Could hide under his table and hand him <mark4>cartridges</mark4><br>
At the window, to complete the romantic <mark3>effect.</mark3><br>
It is clear that <mark4>Mr</mark4>, Haggard is Ryder's <mark4>brother!</mark4><br>
He said, "You'd sell your life for a bunch of banana <mark1>trees."</mark1><br>
<br>
I've given permission to most of the <mark4>"boys"</mark4><br>
To go to the <mark4>races</mark4>, Lloyd has put up the lawn tennis <mark4>things.</mark4><br>
Mr. Gurr, the neighbor, rushes in to say war has <mark4>begun.</mark4><br>
We all race to the <mark4>mission</mark4>, Eleven heads have been <mark4>taken.</mark4><br>
Later: Mr. Dine's cousin received a head smeared with <mark4>black</mark4><br>
(The custom is to return them to the <mark4>bereaved).</mark4><br>
He washed it off and discovered it was his <mark1>brother.</mark1><br>
<br>
He sat there, holding his brother's head in his <mark1>hands,</mark1><br>
Kissing it, bathing it with his <mark4>tears</mark4>, A scandal <mark4>arose</mark4><br>
Because the heads of three girls have been taken as <mark1>well</mark1><br>
(Unheard of before in Samoa), returned wrapped in silk to their <mark4>kin.</mark4><br>
At Malie, the warriors danced a head-hunter's <mark4>pantomime;</mark4><br>
The men who had taken heads carried great lumps of raw <mark4>pork</mark4><br>
Between their teeth, cut in the semblance of <mark4>heads.</mark4><br>
<br>
I stopped writing this. Too hysterical with <mark4>migraine.</mark4><br>
Also, people find where I hide <mark4>it</mark4>, and strike things <mark1>out.</mark1><br>
Our favorite chief is exiled for life. The war winds <mark1>down.</mark1><br>
Louis works on his masterpiece, The Weir of Hermiston. <br>
Well, I've kept him alive for eight more <mark4>years,</mark4><br>
While his dear friends would have condemned him to fog and <mark1>rain</mark1><br>
So they might enjoy his glorious talk in <mark4>London,</mark4><br>
<br>
Though it be the end of him. Fine friends! except for <mark1>James.</mark1><br>
Later: At six, Louis helped with the <mark4>mayonnaise,</mark4><br>
When he put both hands to his head, said, "Oh, what a <mark4>pain!</mark4><br>
Do I look strange?" I said no, not wanting to frighten <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
He was never conscious again. In two hours he <mark4>died.</mark4><br>
Tonight, the chiefs with their axes are digging a <mark4>path</mark4><br>
To the top of the mountain. They will dig his <mark4>grave.</mark4><br>
<br>
I will leave here as soon as I <mark4>can</mark4>, and never <mark4>return,</mark4><br>
Except to be buried beside him. I will live like a gipsy   <br>
In my wild, ragged clothes, until I am <mark1>old</mark1>, <mark4>old.</mark4><br>
I will have pretty gardens wherever I <mark4>am,</mark4><br>
But never breadfruit, custard apples, grenadilla, <mark1>cacao,</mark1><br>
Pineapple, ylang-ylang, citron, <mark4>mango</mark4>, <mark1>cacao,</mark1><br>
Never again succumb to the fever of <mark1>planting.</mark1><br>
