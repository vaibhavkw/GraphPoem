Title : The House of Life: 73. The Choice, III <br>
Author : Dante Gabriel Rossetti <br><br>

Think thou and act; to-morrow thou shalt <mark3>die</mark3><br>
Outstretch'd in the sun's warmth upon the <mark3>shore,</mark3><br>
Thou say'st: "Man's measur'd path is all gone <mark4>o'er:</mark4><br>
Up all his years, steeply, with strain and <mark3>sigh,</mark3><br>
Man clomb until he touch'd the truth; and <mark3>I,</mark3><br>
Even I, am he whom it was destin'd <mark3>for."</mark3><br>
How should this be? Art thou then so much <mark3>more</mark3><br>
Than they who sow'd, that thou shouldst reap <mark3>thereby?</mark3><br>
<br>
Nay, come up hither. From this wave-wash'd <mark4>mound</mark4><br>
Unto the furthest flood-brim look with <mark3>me;</mark3><br>
Then reach on with thy thought till it be <mark4>drown'd.</mark4><br>
Miles and miles distant though the last line <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
And though thy soul sail leagues and leagues <mark4>beyond,?</mark4><br>
Still, leagues beyond those leagues, there is more <mark3>sea.</mark3><br>
