Title : To the Muses <br>
Author : William Blake <br><br>

Whether on Ida's shady <mark3>brow,</mark3><br>
         Or in the chambers of the East, <br>
The chambers of the sun, that <mark3>now</mark3><br>
         From ancient melody have ceas'd; <br>
<br>
Whether in Heav'n ye wander <mark3>fair,</mark3><br>
Or the green corners of the <mark3>earth,</mark3><br>
Or the blue regions of the <mark3>air,</mark3><br>
Where the melodious winds have <mark3>birth;</mark3><br>
<br>
Whether on crystal rocks ye <mark3>rove,</mark3><br>
         Beneath the bosom of the sea <br>
Wand'ring in many a coral <mark3>grove,</mark3><br>
         Fair Nine, forsaking Poetry! <br>
<br>
How have you left the ancient <mark4>love</mark4><br>
That bards of old enjoy'd in <mark3>you!</mark3><br>
The languid strings do scarcely <mark4>move!</mark4><br>
The sound is forc'd, the notes are <mark3>few!</mark3><br>
