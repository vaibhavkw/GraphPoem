Title : For C. <br>
Author : Richard Wilbur <br><br>

After the clash of elevator <mark3>gates</mark3><br>
And the long sinking, she emerges <mark3>where,</mark3><br>
A slight thing in the morning's crosstown <mark3>glare,</mark3><br>
She looks up toward the window where he <mark3>waits,</mark3><br>
Then in a fleeting taxi joins the <mark3>rest</mark3><br>
Of the huge traffic bound forever <mark3>west.</mark3><br>
<br>
On such grand scale do lovers say <mark3>good-bye--</mark3><br>
Even this other pair whose high <mark4>romance</mark4><br>
Had only the duration of a <mark3>dance,</mark3><br>
And who, now taking leave with stricken <mark3>eye,</mark3><br>
See each in each a whole new life <mark4>forgone.</mark4><br>
For them, above the darkling clubhouse <mark4>lawn,</mark4><br>
<br>
Bright Perseids flash and crumble; while for <mark3>these</mark3><br>
Who part now on the dock, weighed down by <mark3>grief</mark3><br>
And baggage, yet with something like <mark3>relief,</mark3><br>
It takes three thousand miles of knitting <mark3>seas</mark3><br>
To cancel out their crossing, and unmake <br>
The amorous rough and tumble of their wake. <br>
<br>
We are denied, my love, their fine tristesse   <br>
And bittersweet regrets, and cannot <mark3>share</mark3><br>
The frequent vistas of their large <mark3>despair,</mark3><br>
Where love and all are swept to <mark4>nothingness;</mark4><br>
Still, there's a certain scope in that long <mark3>love</mark3><br>
Which constant spirits are the keepers <mark3>of,</mark3><br>
<br>
And which, though taken to be tame and <mark3>staid,</mark3><br>
Is a wild sostenuto of the <mark4>heart,</mark4><br>
A passion joined to courtesy and <mark3>art</mark3><br>
Which has the quality of something <mark3>made,</mark3><br>
Like a good fiddle, like the rose's <mark4>scent,</mark4><br>
Like a rose window or the firmament.<br>
