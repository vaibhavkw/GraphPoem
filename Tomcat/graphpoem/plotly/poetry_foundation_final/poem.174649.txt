Title : from The Princess: Our Enemies Have Fall'n <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

Our enemies have fall'n, have fall'n: the <mark4>seed,</mark4><br>
The little seed they laugh'd at in the <mark4>dark,</mark4><br>
Has risen and cleft the soil, and grown a <mark4>bulk</mark4><br>
Of spanless girth, that lays on every <mark4>side</mark4><br>
A thousand arms and rushes to the <mark4>Sun.</mark4><br>
<br>
Our enemies have fall'n, have fall'n: they <mark1>came;</mark1><br>
The leaves were wet with women's tears: they <mark4>heard</mark4><br>
A noise of songs they would not <mark4>understand:</mark4><br>
They mark'd it with the red cross to the fall, <br>
And would have strown it, and are fall'n <mark4>themselves.</mark4><br>
<br>
Our enemies have fall'n, have fall'n: they <mark1>came,</mark1><br>
The woodmen with their axes: lo the tree! <br>
But we will make it faggots for the <mark5>hearth,</mark5><br>
And shape it plank and beam for roof and floor, <br>
And boats and bridges for the use of <mark4>men.</mark4><br>
<br>
Our enemies have fall'n, have fall'n: they <mark4>struck;</mark4><br>
With their own blows they hurt themselves, nor knew <br>
There dwelt an iron nature in the <mark4>grain:</mark4><br>
The glittering axe was broken in their <mark4>arms,</mark4><br>
Their arms were shatter'd to the shoulder <mark4>blade.</mark4><br>
<br>
         Our enemies have fall'n, but this shall grow <br>
A night of Summer from the heat, a <mark4>breadth</mark4><br>
Of Autumn, dropping fruits of power; and <mark4>roll'd</mark4><br>
With music in the growing breeze of <mark4>Time,</mark4><br>
The tops shall strike from star to star, the <mark4>fangs</mark4><br>
Shall move the stony bases of the <mark4>world.</mark4><br>
