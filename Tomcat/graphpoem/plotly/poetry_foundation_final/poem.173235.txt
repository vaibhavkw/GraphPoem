Title : Fragment 5: Whom should I choose for my Judge? <br>
Author : Samuel Taylor Coleridge <br><br>

Whom should I choose for my Judge? the earnest, impersonal reader, <br>
Who, in the work, forgets me and the world and himself! <br>
<br>
Ye who have eyes to <mark4>detect</mark4>, and Gall to Chastise the <mark4>imperfect,</mark4><br>
Have you the heart, too, that loves, feels and rewards the Compleat? <br>
<br>
What is the meed of thy Song? 'Tis the ceaseless, the thousandfold Echo <br>
Which from the welcoming Hearts of the Pure repeats and prolongs <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
Each with a different Tone, compleat or in musical fragments. <br>
