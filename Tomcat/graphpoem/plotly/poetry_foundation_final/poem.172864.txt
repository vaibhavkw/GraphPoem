Title : Thyrsis: A Monody, to Commemorate the Author's Friend, Arthur Hugh Clough <br>
Author : Matthew Arnold <br><br>

How changed is here each spot man makes or <mark3>fills!</mark3><br>
In the two Hinkseys nothing keeps the <mark3>same;</mark3><br>
The village street its haunted mansion <mark3>lacks,</mark3><br>
And from the sign is gone Sibylla's <mark3>name,</mark3><br>
And from the roofs the twisted <mark3>chimney-stacks--</mark3><br>
Are ye too changed, ye <mark3>hills?</mark3><br>
See, 'tis no foot of unfamiliar <mark3>men</mark3><br>
To-night from Oxford up your pathway <mark4>strays!</mark4><br>
Here came I often, often, in old <mark3>days--</mark3><br>
Thyrsis and I; we still had Thyrsis <mark3>then.</mark3><br>
<br>
Runs it not here, the track by Childsworth <mark4>Farm,</mark4><br>
Past the high wood, to where the elm-tree <mark4>crowns</mark4><br>
The hill behind whose ridge the sunset <mark4>flames?</mark4><br>
The signal-elm, that looks on Ilsley <mark4>Downs,</mark4><br>
The Vale, the three lone weirs, the youthful <mark4>Thames?--</mark4><br>
This winter-eve is <mark4>warm,</mark4><br>
Humid the air! leafless, yet soft as <mark4>spring,</mark4><br>
The tender purple spray on copse and <mark5>briers!</mark5><br>
And that sweet city with her dreaming <mark4>spires,</mark4><br>
She needs not June for beauty's <mark4>heightening,</mark4><br>
<br>
Lovely all times she lies, lovely <mark3>to-night!--</mark3><br>
Only, methinks, some loss of habit's <mark3>power</mark3><br>
Befalls me wandering through this upland <mark4>dim.</mark4><br>
Once pass'd I blindfold <mark4>here</mark4>, at any <mark3>hour;</mark3><br>
Now seldom come I, since I came with <mark3>him.</mark3><br>
That single elm-tree <mark3>bright</mark3><br>
Against the west--I miss it! is it <mark4>goner?</mark4><br>
We prized it dearly; while it <mark4>stood</mark4>, we <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
Our friend, the Gipsy-Scholar, was not <mark3>dead;</mark3><br>
While the tree lived, he in these fields lived <mark4>on.</mark4><br>
<br>
Too <mark4>rare</mark4>, too rare, grow now my visits <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
But once I knew each field, each flower, each <mark3>stick;</mark3><br>
And with the country-folk acquaintance <mark4>made</mark4><br>
By barn in threshing-time, by new-built <mark3>rick.</mark3><br>
Here, too, our shepherd-pipes we first <mark4>assay'd.</mark4><br>
Ah me! this many a <mark4>year</mark4><br>
       My pipe is lost, my shepherd's holiday!<br>
Needs must I lose them, needs with heavy <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
Into the world and wave of men <mark3>depart;</mark3><br>
But Thyrsis of his own will went <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
<br>
It irk'd him to be here, he could not <mark4>rest.</mark4><br>
He loved each simple joy the country <mark4>yields,</mark4><br>
He loved his mates; but yet he could not <mark3>keep,</mark3><br>
For that a shadow lour'd on the <mark3>fields,</mark3><br>
Here with the shepherds and the silly <mark3>sheep.</mark3><br>
                      Some life of men unblest<br>
He knew, which made him droop, and fill'd his <mark4>head.</mark4><br>
He went; his piping took a troubled <mark4>sound</mark4><br>
Of storms that rage outside our happy <mark3>ground;</mark3><br>
He could not wait their passing, he is <mark1>dead.</mark1><br>
<br>
So, some tempestuous morn in early <mark4>June,</mark4><br>
When the year's primal burst of bloom is <mark4>o'er,</mark4><br>
Before the roses and the longest <mark3>day--</mark3><br>
When garden-walks and all the grassy <mark4>floor</mark4><br>
With blossoms red and white of fallen <mark3>May</mark3><br>
And chestnut-flowers are <mark3>strewn--</mark3><br>
So have I heard the cuckoo's parting <mark3>cry,</mark3><br>
From the wet field, through the vext <mark4>garden-trees,</mark4><br>
Come with the volleying rain and tossing <mark3>breeze:</mark3><br>
The bloom is gone, and with the bloom go <mark3>I!</mark3><br>
<br>
Too quick despairer, wherefore wilt thou <mark3>go?</mark3><br>
Soon will the high Midsummer pomps come <mark1>on,</mark1><br>
Soon will the musk carnations break and <mark3>swell,</mark3><br>
Soon shall we have gold-dusted <mark4>snapdragon,</mark4><br>
Sweet-William with his homely <mark3>cottage-smell,</mark3><br>
And stocks in fragrant <mark3>blow;</mark3><br>
Roses that down the alleys shine <mark4>afar,</mark4><br>
               And open, jasmine-muffled lattices,<br>
And groups under the dreaming <mark1>garden-trees,</mark1><br>
And the full moon, and the white <mark3>evening-star.</mark3><br>
<br>
He hearkens not! light comer, he is <mark4>flown!</mark4><br>
What matters it? next year he will <mark4>return,</mark4><br>
And we shall have him in the sweet <mark4>spring-days,</mark4><br>
With whitening hedges, and uncrumpling <mark3>fern,</mark3><br>
And blue-bells trembling by the <mark3>forest-ways,</mark3><br>
And scent of hay <mark5>new-mown.</mark5><br>
But Thyrsis never more we swains shall <mark3>see;</mark3><br>
See him come back, and cut a smoother <mark4>reed,</mark4><br>
And blow a strain the world at last shall <mark3>heed--</mark3><br>
For Time, not Corydon, hath conquer'd <mark3>thee!</mark3><br>
<br>
Alack, for Corydon no rival <mark3>now!--</mark3><br>
But when Sicilian shepherds lost a <mark4>mate,</mark4><br>
Some good survivor with his flute would <mark1>go,</mark1><br>
Piping a ditty sad for Bion's <mark3>fate;</mark3><br>
And cross the unpermitted ferry's <mark3>flow,</mark3><br>
And relax Pluto's <mark3>brow,</mark3><br>
And make leap up with joy the beauteous <mark1>head</mark1><br>
Of Proserpine, among whose crowned <mark4>hair</mark4><br>
Are flowers first open'd on Sicilian <mark3>air,</mark3><br>
And flute his friend, like Orpheus, from the <mark1>dead.</mark1><br>
<br>
O easy access to the hearer's <mark4>grace</mark4><br>
       When Dorian shepherds sang to Proserpine!<br>
For she herself had trod Sicilian <mark1>fields,</mark1><br>
She knew the Dorian water's gush <mark4>divine,</mark4><br>
She knew each lily white which Enna <mark1>yields</mark1><br>
Each rose with blushing <mark3>face;</mark3><br>
She loved the Dorian pipe, the Dorian <mark4>strain.</mark4><br>
But ah, of our poor Thames she never <mark4>heard!</mark4><br>
Her foot the Cumner cowslips never <mark5>stirr'd;</mark5><br>
And we should tease her with our plaint in <mark3>vain!</mark3><br>
<br>
Well! wind-dispersed and vain the words will <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
Yet, Thyrsis, let me give my grief its <mark1>hour</mark1><br>
In the old haunt, and find our tree-topp'd <mark4>hill!</mark4><br>
Who, if not I, for questing here hath <mark1>power?</mark1><br>
I know the wood which hides the <mark4>daffodil,</mark4><br>
I know the Fyfield <mark3>tree,</mark3><br>
       I know what white, what purple fritillaries<br>
The grassy harvest of the <mark3>river-fields,</mark3><br>
Above by Ensham, down by Sandford, <mark1>yields,</mark1><br>
And what sedged brooks are Thames's <mark4>tributaries;</mark4><br>
<br>
I know these slopes; who knows them if not <mark1>I?--</mark1><br>
But many a tingle on the loved <mark4>hillside,</mark4><br>
With thorns once studded, old, white-blossom'd <mark4>trees,</mark4><br>
Where thick the cowslips grew, and far <mark5>descried</mark5><br>
               High tower'd the spikes of purple orchises,<br>
Hath since our day put <mark3>by</mark3><br>
The coronals of that forgotten <mark4>time;</mark4><br>
Down each green bank hath gone the ploughboy's <mark4>team,</mark4><br>
And only in the hidden brookside <mark3>gleam</mark3><br>
Primroses, orphans of the flowery <mark4>prime.</mark4><br>
<br>
Where is the girl, who by the boatman's <mark4>door,</mark4><br>
Above the locks, above the boating <mark4>throng,</mark4><br>
Unmoor'd our skiff when through the Wytham <mark4>flats,</mark4><br>
Red loosestrife and blond meadow-sweet <mark4>among</mark4><br>
And darting swallows and light <mark3>water-gnats,</mark3><br>
We track'd the shy Thames <mark3>shore?</mark3><br>
Where are the mowers, who, as the tiny <mark1>swell</mark1><br>
Of our boat passing heaved the <mark4>river-grass,</mark4><br>
Stood with suspended scythe to see us <mark3>pass?--</mark3><br>
They all are gone, and thou art gone as <mark3>well!</mark3><br>
<br>
Yes, thou art gone! and round me too the <mark4>night</mark4><br>
In ever-nearing circle weaves her <mark4>shade.</mark4><br>
I see her veil draw soft across the <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
I feel her slowly chilling breath <mark3>invade</mark3><br>
The cheek grown thin, the brown hair sprent with <mark3>grey;</mark3><br>
I feel her finger <mark3>light</mark3><br>
Laid pausefully upon life's headlong train; <mark3>--</mark3><br>
The foot less prompt to meet the morning <mark3>dew,</mark3><br>
The heart less bounding at emotion <mark3>new,</mark3><br>
And hope, once crush'd, less quick to spring <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
<br>
And long the way appears, which seem'd so <mark4>short</mark4><br>
To the less practised eye of sanguine <mark3>youth;</mark3><br>
And high the mountain-tops, in cloudy <mark1>air,</mark1><br>
The mountain-tops where is the throne of <mark3>Truth,</mark3><br>
Tops in life's morning-sun so bright and <mark3>bare!</mark3><br>
Unbreachable the <mark3>fort</mark3><br>
Of the long-batter'd world uplifts its <mark4>wall;</mark4><br>
And strange and vain the earthly turmoil <mark4>grows,</mark4><br>
And near and real the charm of thy <mark3>repose,</mark3><br>
And night as welcome as a friend would <mark3>fall.</mark3><br>
<br>
But hush! the upland hath a sudden <mark4>loss</mark4><br>
Of quiet!--Look, adown the dusk <mark4>hill-side,</mark4><br>
A troop of Oxford hunters going <mark4>home,</mark4><br>
As in old days, jovial and talking, <mark4>ride!</mark4><br>
From hunting with the Berkshire hounds they <mark4>come.</mark4><br>
Quick! let me fly, and <mark3>cross</mark3><br>
Into yon farther field!--'Tis done; and <mark1>see,</mark1><br>
               Back'd by the sunset, which doth glorify<br>
The orange and pale violet <mark3>evening-sky,</mark3><br>
Bare on its lonely ridge, the Tree! the <mark1>Tree!</mark1><br>
<br>
I take the omen! Eve lets down her <mark4>veil,</mark4><br>
The white fog creeps from bush to bush <mark4>about,</mark4><br>
The west unflushes, the high stars grow <mark1>bright,</mark1><br>
And in the scatter'd farms the lights come <mark4>out.</mark4><br>
I cannot reach the signal-tree <mark1>to-night,</mark1><br>
Yet, happy omen, <mark3>hail!</mark3><br>
Hear it from thy broad lucent <mark3>Arno-vale</mark3><br>
(For there thine earth forgetting eyelids <mark1>keep</mark1><br>
The morningless and unawakening <mark3>sleep</mark3><br>
Under the flowery oleanders <mark3>pale),</mark3><br>
<br>
Hear it, O Thyrsis, still our tree is <mark3>there!--</mark3><br>
Ah, vain! These English fields, this upland <mark1>dim,</mark1><br>
               These brambles pale with mist engarlanded,<br>
That lone, sky-pointing tree, are not for <mark1>him;</mark1><br>
To a boon southern country he is <mark4>fled,</mark4><br>
And now in happier <mark1>air,</mark1><br>
Wandering with the great Mother's train <mark1>divine</mark1><br>
(And purer or more subtle soul than <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
I trow, the mighty Mother doth not <mark1>see)</mark1><br>
Within a folding of the <mark4>Apennine,</mark4><br>
<br>
Thou hearest the immortal chants of <mark4>old!--</mark4><br>
Putting his sickle to the perilous <mark4>grain</mark4><br>
In the hot cornfield of the Phrygian <mark4>king,</mark4><br>
For thee the Lityerses-song <mark1>again</mark1><br>
Young Daphnis with his silver voice doth <mark3>sing;</mark3><br>
Sings his Sicilian <mark3>fold,</mark3><br>
His sheep, his hapless love, his blinded <mark4>eyes--</mark4><br>
And how a call celestial round him <mark4>rang,</mark4><br>
And heavenward from the fountain-brink he <mark3>sprang,</mark3><br>
And all the marvel of the golden <mark3>skies.</mark3><br>
<br>
There thou art gone, and me thou leavest <mark1>here</mark1><br>
Sole in these fields! yet will I not <mark4>despair.</mark4><br>
Despair I will not, while I yet <mark5>descry</mark5><br>
'Neath the mild canopy of English <mark1>air</mark1><br>
That lonely tree against the western <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
Still, still these slopes, 'tis <mark4>clear,</mark4><br>
Our Gipsy-Scholar haunts, outliving <mark1>thee!</mark1><br>
Fields where soft sheep from cages pull the <mark3>hay,</mark3><br>
Woods with anemonies in flower till <mark1>May,</mark1><br>
Know him a wanderer still; then why not <mark3>me?</mark3><br>
<br>
A fugitive and gracious light he <mark4>seeks,</mark4><br>
Shy to illumine; and I seek it <mark3>too.</mark3><br>
This does not come with houses or with <mark3>gold,</mark3><br>
With place, with honour, and a flattering <mark3>crew;</mark3><br>
'Tis not in the world's market bought and <mark3>sold--</mark3><br>
But the smooth-slipping <mark3>weeks</mark3><br>
       Drop by, and leave its seeker still untired;<br>
Out of the heed of mortals he is <mark4>gone,</mark4><br>
He wends unfollow'd, he must house <mark4>alone;</mark4><br>
Yet on he fares, by his own heart <mark4>inspired.</mark4><br>
<br>
Thou too, O Thyrsis, on like quest wast <mark4>bound;</mark4><br>
Thou wanderedst with me for a little <mark1>hour!</mark1><br>
Men gave thee nothing; but this happy <mark4>quest,</mark4><br>
If men esteem'd thee feeble, gave thee <mark1>power,</mark1><br>
If men procured thee trouble, gave thee <mark1>rest.</mark1><br>
And this rude Cumner <mark1>ground,</mark1><br>
Its fir-topped Hurst, its <mark4>farms</mark4>, its quiet <mark1>fields,</mark1><br>
Here cams't thou in thy jocund youthful <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
Here was thine height of strength, thy golden <mark1>prime!</mark1><br>
And still the haunt beloved a virtue <mark1>yields.</mark1><br>
<br>
What though the music of thy rustic <mark4>flute</mark4><br>
Kept not for long its happy, country <mark3>tone;</mark3><br>
Lost it too soon, and learnt a stormy <mark4>note</mark4><br>
Of men contention-tost, of men who <mark3>groan,</mark3><br>
Which task'd thy pipe too sore, and tired thy <mark3>throat--</mark3><br>
It fail'd, and thou wage <mark4>mute!</mark4><br>
Yet hadst thou always visions of our <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
And long with men of care thou couldst not <mark3>stay,</mark3><br>
And soon thy foot resumed its wandering <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
Left human <mark4>haunt</mark4>, and on alone till <mark1>night.</mark1><br>
<br>
Too <mark4>rare</mark4>, too rare, grow now my visits <mark1>here!</mark1><br>
'Mid city-noise, not, as with thee of <mark4>yore,</mark4><br>
Thyrsis! in reach of sheep-bells is my <mark1>home.</mark1><br>
--Then through the great town's harsh, heart-wearying <mark3>roar,</mark3><br>
Let in thy voice a whisper often <mark1>come,</mark1><br>
To chase fatigue and <mark4>fear:</mark4><br>
Why faintest thou! I wander'd till I <mark4>died.</mark4><br>
Roam on! The light we sought is shining <mark4>still.</mark4><br>
Dost thou ask proof? Our tree yet crowns the <mark1>hill,</mark1><br>
Our Scholar travels yet the loved <mark1>hill-side.</mark1><br>
