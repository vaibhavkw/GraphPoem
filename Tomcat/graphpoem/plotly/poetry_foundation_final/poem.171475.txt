Title : My Autumn Leaves <br>
Author : Bruce Weigl <br><br>

I watch the woods for deer as if I'm <mark1>armed.</mark1><br>
I watch the woods for deer who never <mark4>come.</mark4><br>
I know the hes and shes in <mark4>autumn</mark4><br>
rendezvous in orchards stained with <mark4>fallen</mark4><br>
apples' scent. I drive my car this way to work   <br>
so I may let the crows in corn believe <br>
it's me their caws are meant to <mark4>warn,</mark4><br>
and snakes who turn in warm and secret caves <br>
<br>
they know me too. They know the boy <br>
who lives inside me still won't go away. <br>
The deer are ghosts who slip between the light   <br>
through trees, so you may only hear the <mark4>snap</mark4><br>
of branches in the thicket beyond <mark4>hope.</mark4><br>
I watch the woods for deer, as if I'm <mark1>armed.</mark1><br>
