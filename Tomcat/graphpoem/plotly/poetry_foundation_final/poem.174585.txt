Title : Break, Break, Break <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

Break, <mark1>break</mark1>, <mark1>break,</mark1><br>
On thy cold gray stones, O <mark3>Sea!</mark3><br>
And I would that my tongue could utter <br>
The thoughts that arise in <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
<br>
O, well for the fisherman's boy, <br>
That he shouts with his sister at <mark3>play!</mark3><br>
O, well for the sailor <mark4>lad,</mark4><br>
That he sings in his boat on the <mark3>bay!</mark3><br>
<br>
And the stately ships go on <br>
To their haven under the <mark3>hill;</mark3><br>
But O for the touch of a vanish'd <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
And the sound of a voice that is <mark3>still!</mark3><br>
<br>
Break, <mark1>break</mark1>, <mark1>break</mark1><br>
At the foot of thy crags, O <mark1>Sea!</mark1><br>
But the tender grace of a day that is <mark4>dead</mark4><br>
Will never come back to <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
