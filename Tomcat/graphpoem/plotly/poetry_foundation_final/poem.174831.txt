Title : To the Cuckoo <br>
Author : William Wordsworth <br><br>

O blithe New-comer! I have <mark3>heard,</mark3><br>
I hear thee and <mark3>rejoice.</mark3><br>
O Cuckoo! shall I call thee <mark3>Bird,</mark3><br>
Or but a wandering <mark3>Voice?</mark3><br>
<br>
While I am lying on the <mark4>grass</mark4><br>
Thy twofold shout I <mark5>hear;</mark5><br>
From hill to hill it seems to <mark3>pass,</mark3><br>
At once far off, and <mark4>near.</mark4><br>
<br>
Though babbling only to the <mark3>Vale</mark3><br>
Of sunshine and of <mark3>flowers,</mark3><br>
Thou bringest unto me a <mark3>tale</mark3><br>
Of visionary <mark3>hours.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thrice welcome, darling of the <mark3>Spring!</mark3><br>
Even yet thou art to <mark3>me</mark3><br>
No bird, but an invisible <mark3>thing,</mark3><br>
A voice, a <mark4>mystery;</mark4><br>
<br>
The same whom in my school-boy <mark4>days</mark4><br>
I listened to; that <mark3>Cry</mark3><br>
Which made me look a thousand <mark3>ways</mark3><br>
In bush, and tree, and <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
<br>
To seek thee did I often <mark4>rove</mark4><br>
Through woods and on the <mark3>green;</mark3><br>
And thou wert still a hope, a <mark4>love;</mark4><br>
Still longed for, never <mark3>seen.</mark3><br>
<br>
And I can listen to thee <mark3>yet;</mark3><br>
Can lie upon the <mark4>plain</mark4><br>
And listen, till I do <mark3>beget</mark3><br>
That golden time <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
<br>
O blessed Bird! the earth we <mark4>pace</mark4><br>
Again appears to <mark4>be</mark4><br>
An unsubstantial, faery <mark3>place;</mark3><br>
That is fit home for <mark3>Thee!</mark3><br>
