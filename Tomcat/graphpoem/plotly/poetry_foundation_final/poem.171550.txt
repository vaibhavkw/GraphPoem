Title : Things <br>
Author : Louis Simpson <br><br>

A man stood in the laurel tree <br>
Adjusting his hands and feet to the <mark4>boughs.</mark4><br>
He said, "Today I was breaking <mark4>stones</mark4><br>
On a mountain road in <mark4>Asia,</mark4><br>
<br>
When suddenly I had a <mark4>vision</mark4><br>
Of mankind, like grass and <mark4>flowers,</mark4><br>
The same over all the earth. <br>
We forgave each other; we gave <mark4>ourselves</mark4><br>
Wholly over to <mark4>words.</mark4><br>
And straightway I was <mark4>released</mark4><br>
And sprang through an open <mark4>gate."</mark4><br>
<br>
I said, "Into a <mark1>meadow?"</mark1><br>
<br>
He said, "I am impervious to irony.   <br>
I thank you for the word <mark5>...</mark5><br>
I am standing in a sunlit <mark1>meadow.</mark1><br>
Know that everything your senses <mark4>reject</mark4><br>
Springs up in the spiritual <mark4>world."</mark4><br>
<br>
I said, "Our scientists have another <mark4>opinion.</mark4><br>
They say, you are merely <mark4>phenomena."</mark4><br>
<br>
He said, "Over here they will be <mark4>angels</mark4><br>
Singing, Holy holy be His Name! <br>
And also, it works in <mark4>reverse.</mark4><br>
Things which to us in the pure state are <mark4>mysterious,</mark4><br>
Are your simplest articles of household <mark4>use--</mark4><br>
A chair, a dish, and meaner even than <mark4>these,</mark4><br>
The very latest <mark4>inventions.</mark4><br>
Machines are the animals of the <mark4>Americans--</mark4><br>
Tell me about <mark4>machines."</mark4><br>
<br>
I <mark4>said</mark4>, "I have <mark4>suspected</mark4><br>
The Mixmaster knows more than I do,   <br>
The air conditioner is the better <mark4>poet.</mark4><br>
My right front tire is as bald as <mark4>Odysseus--</mark4><br>
How much it must have <mark4>suffered!</mark4><br>
Then, as things have a third <mark4>substance</mark4><br>
Which is obscure to both our <mark4>senses,</mark4><br>
Let there be a perpetual coming and <mark4>going</mark4><br>
Between your house and <mark4>mine."</mark4><br>
