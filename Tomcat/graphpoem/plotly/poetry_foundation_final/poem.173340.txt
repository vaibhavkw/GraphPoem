Title : The Bustle in a House (1108) <br>
Author : Emily Dickinson <br><br>

The Bustle in a House <br>
The Morning after <mark4>Death</mark4><br>
Is solemnest of industries <br>
Enacted opon Earth <mark4>-</mark4><br>
<br>
The Sweeping up the Heart <br>
And putting Love away <br>
We shall not want to use again <br>
Until Eternity - <br>
