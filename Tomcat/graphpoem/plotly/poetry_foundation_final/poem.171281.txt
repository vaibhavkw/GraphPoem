Title : In Celebration of My Uterus <br>
Author : Anne Sexton <br><br>

Everyone in me is a <mark4>bird.</mark4><br>
I am beating all my <mark4>wings.</mark4><br>
They wanted to cut you <mark4>out</mark4><br>
but they will <mark4>not.</mark4><br>
They said you were immeasurably empty   <br>
but you are <mark1>not.</mark1><br>
They said you were sick unto <mark4>dying</mark4><br>
but they were <mark4>wrong.</mark4><br>
You are singing like a school <mark4>girl.</mark4><br>
You are not <mark4>torn.</mark4><br>
<br>
Sweet <mark4>weight,</mark4><br>
in celebration of the woman I <mark1>am</mark1><br>
and of the soul of the woman I <mark1>am</mark1><br>
and of the central creature and its <mark4>delight</mark4><br>
I sing for you. I dare to live. <br>
Hello, spirit. Hello, cup. <br>
Fasten, cover. Cover that does <mark4>contain.</mark4><br>
Hello to the soil of the <mark4>fields.</mark4><br>
Welcome, <mark4>roots.</mark4><br>
<br>
Each cell has a <mark4>life.</mark4><br>
There is enough here to please a <mark4>nation.</mark4><br>
It is enough that the populace own these <mark4>goods.</mark4><br>
Any person, any commonwealth would say of <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
"It is good this year that we may plant <mark4>again</mark4><br>
and think forward to a <mark4>harvest.</mark4><br>
A blight had been forecast and has been cast <mark1>out."</mark1><br>
Many women are singing together of <mark4>this:</mark4><br>
one is in a shoe factory cursing the <mark4>machine,</mark4><br>
one is at the aquarium tending a <mark4>seal,</mark4><br>
one is dull at the wheel of her <mark4>Ford,</mark4><br>
one is at the toll gate <mark4>collecting,</mark4><br>
one is tying the cord of a calf in <mark4>Arizona,</mark4><br>
one is straddling a cello in <mark4>Russia,</mark4><br>
one is shifting pots on the stove in <mark4>Egypt,</mark4><br>
one is painting her bedroom walls moon <mark5>color,</mark5><br>
one is dying but remembering a <mark4>breakfast,</mark4><br>
one is stretching on her mat in <mark4>Thailand,</mark4><br>
one is wiping the ass of her <mark4>child,</mark4><br>
one is staring out the window of a <mark4>train</mark4><br>
in the middle of Wyoming and one <mark4>is</mark4><br>
anywhere and some are everywhere and <mark4>all</mark4><br>
seem to be singing, although some can <mark1>not</mark1><br>
sing a <mark4>note.</mark4><br>
<br>
Sweet <mark1>weight,</mark1><br>
in celebration of the woman I <mark1>am</mark1><br>
let me carry a ten-foot <mark4>scarf,</mark4><br>
let me drum for the nineteen-year-olds, <br>
let me carry bowls for the <mark4>offering</mark4><br>
(if that is my <mark4>part).</mark4><br>
Let me study the cardiovascular tissue, <br>
let me examine the angular distance of <mark4>meteors,</mark4><br>
let me suck on the stems of <mark4>flowers</mark4><br>
(if that is my <mark1>part).</mark1><br>
Let me make certain tribal <mark4>figures</mark4><br>
(if that is my <mark1>part).</mark1><br>
For this thing the body <mark4>needs</mark4><br>
let me <mark4>sing</mark4><br>
for the <mark4>supper,</mark4><br>
for the <mark4>kissing,</mark4><br>
for the <mark4>correct</mark4><br>
