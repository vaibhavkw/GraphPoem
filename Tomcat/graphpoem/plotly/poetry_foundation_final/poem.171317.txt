Title : Sonnet. To Tell the Truth <br>
Author : Alicia Ostriker <br><br>

To tell the truth, those brick Housing Authority <mark4>buildings</mark4><br>
For whose loveliness no soul had <mark4>planned,</mark4><br>
Like random dominoes stood, worn out and facing each <mark3>other,</mark3><br>
Creating the enclosure that was our home. <br>
<br>
Long basement corridors connected one house to <mark3>another</mark3><br>
And had a special smell, from old bicycles and baby <mark4>carriages</mark4><br>
In the storage <mark4>rooms</mark4>, The <mark4>elevators</mark4><br>
Were used by kissing <mark4>teenagers.</mark4><br>
<br>
The playground--iron swingchains, <mark4>fences</mark4>, iron monkey <mark4>bars,</mark4><br>
Iron seesaw handles, doubtless now <mark4>rusted--</mark4><br>
Left a strong iron smell on my hands and in the autumn air   <br>
And rang with cries. To me it is even <mark4>precious</mark4><br>
<br>
Where they chased the local Mongoloid, yelling "Stupid Joey! Stupid Joey!" <br>
Now I've said everything nice I can about <mark4>this.</mark4><br>
