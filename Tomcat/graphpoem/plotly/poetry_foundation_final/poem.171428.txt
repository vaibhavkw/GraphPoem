Title : The Strength of Fields <br>
Author : James L. Dickey <br><br>

... a separation from the world, a penetration to some source of power and a life-enhancing return ...               Van Gennep: Rites de Passage <br>
<br>
Moth-force a small town always <mark4>has,</mark4><br>
Given the <mark4>night.</mark4><br>
<br>
What field-forms can <mark4>be,</mark4><br>
<br>
Outlying the small civic light-decisions <mark4>over</mark4><br>
               A man walking near home? <br>
Men are not where he <mark4>is</mark4><br>
      Exactly now, but they are around him    around him like the strength <br>
Of fields.    The solar system floats <mark4>on</mark4><br>
<br>
Above him in <mark4>town-moths.</mark4><br>
Tell me, <mark4>train-sound,</mark4><br>
    With all your long-lost grief, <br>
                                                         what I can give.   <br>
Dear Lord of all the <mark4>fields</mark4><br>
                                                         what am I going to do? <br>
                                        Street-lights, blue-force and frail <br>
As the homes of men, tell me how to do it    how <br>
To withdraw    how to penetrate and find the <mark4>source</mark4><br>
Of the power you always <mark4>had</mark4><br>
light as a moth, and <mark4>rising</mark4><br>
With the level and moonlit <mark4>expansion</mark4><br>
Of the fields <mark4>around</mark4>, and the sleep of hoping <mark4>men.</mark4><br>
You?    I?    What difference is there?    We can all be <mark4>saved</mark4><br>
<br>
By a secret blooming. Now as I <mark4>walk</mark4><br>
<br>
The night    and you walk with me    we know <mark4>simplicity</mark4><br>
Is close to the source that sleeping <mark1>men</mark1><br>
Search for in their home-deep <mark4>beds.</mark4><br>
We know that the sun is away    we know that the sun can be <mark4>conquered</mark4><br>
By moths, in blue home-town <mark4>air.</mark4><br>
The stars splinter, pointed and wild. The dead lie <mark4>under</mark4><br>
The pastures.    They look on and help.    Tell me, <mark4>freight-train,</mark4><br>
When there is no one <mark4>else</mark4><br>
To hear. Tell me in a voice the <mark3>sea</mark3><br>
Would have, if it had not a better one: as it <mark4>lifts,</mark4><br>
Hundreds of miles away, its fumbling, deep-structured <mark4>roar</mark4><br>
Like the profound, unstoppable <mark4>craving</mark4><br>
            Of nations for their wish. <br>
Hunger, time and the <mark4>moon:</mark4><br>
The moon lying on the <mark4>brain</mark4><br>
<br>
as on the excited sea    as <mark1>on</mark1><br>
The strength of fields. Lord, let me <mark4>shake</mark4><br>
With purpose.    Wild hope can always <mark4>spring</mark4><br>
From tended strength.    Everything is in <mark4>that.</mark4><br>
That and nothing but kindness.    More kindness, dear <mark4>Lord</mark4><br>
Of the renewing green.    That is where it all has to <mark4>start:</mark4><br>
With the simplest things. More kindness will do nothing <mark4>less</mark4><br>
Than save every sleeping <mark4>one</mark4><br>
And night-walking <mark1>one</mark1><br>
Of <mark3>us.</mark3><br>
<br>
My life belongs to the world. I will do what I <mark4>can.</mark4><br>
