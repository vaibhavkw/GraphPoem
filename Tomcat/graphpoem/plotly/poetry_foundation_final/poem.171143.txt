Title : The Woodpecker Keeps Returning <br>
Author : Jane Hirshfield <br><br>

The woodpecker keeps <mark4>returning</mark4><br>
to drill the house wall. <br>
Put a pie plate over one place, he chooses <mark4>another.</mark4><br>
<br>
There is nothing good to eat <mark3>there:</mark3><br>
he has found in the house <br>
a resonant billboard to post his intentions, <br>
his voluble strength as <mark4>provider.</mark4><br>
<br>
But where is the female he drums for? <mark3>Where?</mark3><br>
<br>
I ask this, who am myself the ruined <mark4>siding,</mark4><br>
the handsome red-capped bird, the missing mate.<br>
