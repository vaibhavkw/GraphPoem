Title : A Shropshire Lad 1: From Clee to heaven the beacon burns <br>
Author : A. E. Housman <br><br>

From Clee to heaven the beacon <mark3>burns,</mark3><br>
The shires have seen it <mark3>plain,</mark3><br>
From north and south the sign <mark3>returns</mark3><br>
And beacons burn <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
<br>
Look left, look <mark3>right</mark3>, the hills are <mark3>bright,</mark3><br>
The dales are light <mark4>between,</mark4><br>
Because 'tis fifty years <mark3>to-night</mark3><br>
That God has saved the <mark3>Queen.</mark3><br>
<br>
Now, when the flame they watch not <mark4>towers</mark4><br>
About the soil they <mark3>trod,</mark3><br>
<mark4>Lads</mark4>, we'll remember friends of <mark3>ours</mark3><br>
Who shared the work with <mark3>God.</mark3><br>
<br>
To skies that knit their heartstrings <mark3>right,</mark3><br>
To fields that bred them <mark3>brave,</mark3><br>
The saviours come not home <mark1>to-night:</mark1><br>
Themselves they could not <mark3>save.</mark3><br>
<br>
It dawns in Asia, tombstones <mark3>show</mark3><br>
And Shropshire names are <mark4>read;</mark4><br>
And the Nile spills his <mark3>overflow</mark3><br>
Beside the Severn's <mark3>dead.</mark3><br>
<br>
We pledge in peace by farm and <mark4>town</mark4><br>
The Queen they served in <mark3>war,</mark3><br>
And fire the beacons up and <mark3>down</mark3><br>
The land they perished <mark3>for.</mark3><br>
<br>
"God save the Queen" we living <mark3>sing,</mark3><br>
From height to height 'tis <mark4>heard;</mark4><br>
And with the rest your voices <mark3>ring,</mark3><br>
Lads of the <mark3>Fifty-third.</mark3><br>
<br>
Oh, God will save her, fear you <mark4>not:</mark4><br>
Be you the men you've <mark4>been,</mark4><br>
Get you the sons your fathers <mark3>got,</mark3><br>
And God will save the <mark1>Queen.</mark1><br>
