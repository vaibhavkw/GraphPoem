Title : The Indifferent <br>
Author : John Donne <br><br>

I can love both fair and <mark3>brown,</mark3><br>
Her whom abundance melts, and her whom want <mark3>betrays,</mark3><br>
Her who loves loneness best, and her who masks and <mark3>plays,</mark3><br>
Her whom the country formed, and whom the <mark3>town,</mark3><br>
Her who <mark4>believes</mark4>, and her who <mark4>tries,</mark4><br>
Her who still weeps with spongy <mark3>eyes,</mark3><br>
And her who is dry cork, and never <mark3>cries;</mark3><br>
I can love her, and her, and <mark1>you</mark1>, and <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
I can love any, so she be not <mark3>true.</mark3><br>
<br>
Will no other vice content <mark1>you?</mark1><br>
Will it not serve your turn to do as did your <mark4>mothers?</mark4><br>
Or have you all old vices spent, and now would find out <mark3>others?</mark3><br>
Or doth a fear that men are true torment <mark1>you?</mark1><br>
O we are not, be not you <mark3>so;</mark3><br>
Let me, and do you, twenty <mark3>know.</mark3><br>
Rob me, but bind me not, and let me <mark3>go.</mark3><br>
Must I, who came to travail thorough <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
Grow your fixed subject, because you are <mark1>true?</mark1><br>
<br>
Venus heard me sigh this <mark3>song,</mark3><br>
And by love's sweetest part, variety, she <mark3>swore,</mark3><br>
She heard not this till now; and that it should be so no <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
She went, examined, and returned ere <mark3>long,</mark3><br>
And said, Alas! some two or <mark3>three</mark3><br>
Poor heretics in love there <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
Which think to 'stablish dangerous <mark4>constancy.</mark4><br>
But I have told them, Since you will be <mark1>true,</mark1><br>
You shall be true to them who are false to <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
