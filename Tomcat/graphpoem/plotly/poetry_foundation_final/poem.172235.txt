Title : Don Juan in Amsterdam <br>
Author : Daryl Hine <br><br>

"e to allor li prega Per quell' amor the i mena, e quei verranno."  INFERNO <mark3>V</mark3><br>
This also is a place that love is known <mark1>in,</mark1><br>
This hollow land beneath a lifeless <mark3>sea</mark3><br>
Opposite to the place that he was born <mark1>in,</mark1><br>
How far it is impossible to <mark3>say.</mark3><br>
The brackish water as I <mark4>crossed</mark4><br>
         A bridge was delicately creased <br>
And stained and stale, like love-disordered <mark4>linen.</mark4><br>
<br>
Lovers here must meet on unsure <mark4>ground</mark4><br>
Like strangers in a circumspect <mark3>hotel</mark3><br>
Which, although luxurious and <mark4>grand,</mark4><br>
Trembles beneath their feet like earth in <mark3>hell.</mark3><br>
Lifted on concentric <mark4>gales</mark4><br>
Scraps of paper, leaves and <mark4>gulls</mark4><br>
Fluttered dismally aloft and <mark4>groaned.</mark4><br>
<br>
Here darkness grows and light itself <mark4>decays;</mark4><br>
Rain falls from time to time and night falls too   <br>
Upon earth's civil centre that <mark4>decoys</mark4><br>
The eternal with the promise that is now. <br>
There were no corners, every <mark4>street</mark4><br>
Ran on infinite and <mark4>straight,</mark4><br>
There is no gate, no warning and no <mark4>keys.</mark4><br>
<br>
I hear a step approaching and <mark4>refuse</mark4><br>
To look aside, a while your <mark4>silhouette</mark4><br>
<mark4>Persists</mark4>, the fire illuminates your <mark4>face</mark4><br>
From under as you light a <mark3>cigarette;</mark3><br>
All-knowing, arch-angelic <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
Human features cut in <mark4>ice--</mark4><br>
The spark you struck at once attained the <mark4>fuse.</mark4><br>
<br>
I recognize the vanity and <mark4>scorn,</mark4><br>
The fear, the greed, in short the mask of <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
Familiar and disdainful, and I <mark4>turn</mark4><br>
About. Like children sharing what they <mark4>have</mark4><br>
We learned in that <mark4>experiment</mark4><br>
What the spirit's weakness <mark4>meant,</mark4><br>
The nature of the torment to be <mark4>borne.</mark4><br>
<br>
What shall I give you? What will be your <mark3>price?</mark3><br>
Your body's mine, the rich, fantastic <mark4>horde</mark4><br>
Of your embracements--angels live on <mark4>praise,</mark4><br>
Take it, it is all I can <mark3>afford.</mark3><br>
Outside a centrifugal <mark4>wind</mark4><br>
         Sustained a freight of souls that whined   <br>
And wept along the terrible <mark4>canals.</mark4><br>
<br>
And when I close my eyes I see a <mark4>ship</mark4><br>
At anchor in the water of a <mark3>bay.</mark3><br>
I cling to that imaginary <mark4>shape</mark4><br>
Capable of taking me <mark3>away</mark3><br>
To I do not know what <mark4>ports.</mark4><br>
Perhaps tomorrow it <mark4>departs,</mark4><br>
Anonymous, invulnerable, <mark3>free.</mark3><br>
