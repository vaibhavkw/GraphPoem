Title : The Green Linnet <br>
Author : William Wordsworth <br><br>

Beneath these fruit-tree boughs that <mark3>shed</mark3><br>
Their snow-white blossoms on my <mark3>head,</mark3><br>
With brightest sunshine round me <mark3>spread</mark3><br>
Of spring's unclouded <mark3>weather,</mark3><br>
In this sequestered nook how <mark3>sweet</mark3><br>
To sit upon my <mark3>orchard-seat!</mark3><br>
And birds and flowers once more to <mark3>greet,</mark3><br>
My last year's friends <mark3>together.</mark3><br>
<br>
One have I <mark4>marked</mark4>, the happiest <mark4>guest</mark4><br>
In all this covert of the <mark3>blest:</mark3><br>
Hail to Thee, far above the <mark3>rest</mark3><br>
In joy of voice and <mark3>pinion!</mark3><br>
Thou, Linnet! in thy green <mark3>array,</mark3><br>
Presiding Spirit here <mark3>to-day,</mark3><br>
Dost lead the revels of the <mark3>May;</mark3><br>
And this is thy <mark3>dominion.</mark3><br>
<br>
While birds, and <mark4>butterflies</mark4>, and <mark4>flowers,</mark4><br>
Make all one band of paramours,<br>
Thou, ranging up and down the <mark3>bowers,</mark3><br>
Art sole in thy <mark4>employment:</mark4><br>
A Life, a Presence like the <mark3>Air,</mark3><br>
Scattering thy gladness without <mark3>care,</mark3><br>
Too blest with any one to <mark3>pair;</mark3><br>
Thyself thy own <mark3>enjoyment.</mark3><br>
<br>
Amid yon tuft of hazel <mark4>trees,</mark4><br>
That twinkle to the gusty <mark3>breeze,</mark3><br>
Behold him perched in ecstasies,<br>
Yet seeming still to <mark4>hover;</mark4><br>
There! where the flutter of his <mark4>wings</mark4><br>
Upon his back and body <mark3>flings</mark3><br>
Shadows and sunny glimmerings,<br>
That cover him all <mark4>over.</mark4><br>
<br>
My dazzled sight he oft deceives,<br>
A brother of the dancing <mark4>leaves;</mark4><br>
Then flits, and from the <mark3>cottage-eaves</mark3><br>
Pours forth his song in <mark4>gushes;</mark4><br>
As if by that exulting <mark4>strain</mark4><br>
He mocked and treated with <mark3>disdain</mark3><br>
The voiceless Form he chose to <mark3>feign,</mark3><br>
While fluttering in the <mark4>bushes.</mark4><br>
