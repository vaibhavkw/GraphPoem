Title : the vacant lot <br>
Author : Gwendolyn Brooks <br><br>

Mrs. Coley's three-flat brick <br>
Isn't here any <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
All done with seeing her fat little form   <br>
Burst out of the basement <mark3>door;</mark3><br>
And with seeing her African son-in-law   <br>
(Rightful heir to the <mark3>throne)</mark3><br>
With his great white strong cold squares of teeth   <br>
And his little eyes of <mark3>stone;</mark3><br>
And with seeing the squat fat daughter   <br>
Letting in the <mark4>men</mark4><br>
When majesty has gone for the day-- <br>
And letting them out <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
