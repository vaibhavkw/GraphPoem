Title : Remembrance <br>
Author : Emily Bronte <br><br>

Cold in the earth--and the deep snow piled above <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
Far, far removed, cold in the dreary <mark3>grave!</mark3><br>
Have I forgot, my only Love, to love <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
Severed at last by Time's all-severing <mark3>wave?</mark3><br>
<br>
Now, when alone, do my thoughts no longer <mark3>hover</mark3><br>
Over the mountains, on that northern <mark3>shore,</mark3><br>
Resting their wings where heath and fern-leaves <mark3>cover</mark3><br>
Thy noble heart forever, ever <mark3>more?</mark3><br>
<br>
Cold in the earth--and fifteen wild Decembers,<br>
From those brown hills, have melted into <mark4>spring:</mark4><br>
Faithful, indeed, is the spirit that remembers<br>
After such years of change and <mark4>suffering!</mark4><br>
<br>
Sweet Love of youth, forgive, if I forget <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
While the world's tide is bearing me <mark4>along;</mark4><br>
Other desires and other hopes beset <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
Hopes which obscure, but cannot do thee <mark3>wrong!</mark3><br>
<br>
No later light has lightened up my <mark4>heaven,</mark4><br>
No second morn has ever shone for <mark1>me;</mark1><br>
All my life's bliss from thy dear life was <mark4>given,</mark4><br>
All my life's bliss is in the grave with <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
<br>
<mark4>But</mark4>, when the days of golden dreams had <mark4>perished,</mark4><br>
And even Despair was powerless to <mark3>destroy,</mark3><br>
Then did I learn how existence could be <mark3>cherished,</mark3><br>
Strengthened, and fed without the aid of <mark3>joy.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then did I check the tears of useless <mark4>passion--</mark4><br>
Weaned my young soul from yearning after <mark4>thine;</mark4><br>
Sternly denied its burning wish to <mark4>hasten</mark4><br>
Down to that tomb already more than <mark4>mine.</mark4><br>
<br>
And, even yet, I dare not let it <mark3>languish,</mark3><br>
Dare not indulge in memory's rapturous <mark4>pain;</mark4><br>
Once drinking deep of that divinest <mark3>anguish,</mark3><br>
How could I seek the empty world <mark3>again?</mark3><br>
