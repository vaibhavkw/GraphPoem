Title : The Wild Swans at Coole <br>
Author : William Butler Yeats <br><br>

The trees are in their autumn <mark5>beauty,</mark5><br>
The woodland paths are <mark3>dry,</mark3><br>
Under the October twilight the <mark4>water</mark4><br>
Mirrors a still <mark3>sky;</mark3><br>
Upon the brimming water among the <mark4>stones</mark4><br>
Are nine-and-fifty <mark4>swans.</mark4><br>
<br>
The nineteenth autumn has come upon me   <br>
Since I first made my <mark4>count;</mark4><br>
I saw, before I had well <mark4>finished,</mark4><br>
All suddenly <mark4>mount</mark4><br>
And scatter wheeling in great broken <mark4>rings</mark4><br>
Upon their clamorous <mark3>wings.</mark3><br>
<br>
I have looked upon those brilliant <mark4>creatures,</mark4><br>
And now my heart is <mark3>sore.</mark3><br>
All's changed since I, hearing at <mark4>twilight,</mark4><br>
The first time on this <mark3>shore,</mark3><br>
The bell-beat of their wings above my <mark3>head,</mark3><br>
Trod with a lighter <mark3>tread.</mark3><br>
<br>
Unwearied still, lover by <mark4>lover,</mark4><br>
They paddle in the <mark4>cold</mark4><br>
Companionable streams or climb the <mark4>air;</mark4><br>
Their hearts have not grown <mark3>old;</mark3><br>
Passion or conquest, wander where they <mark3>will,</mark3><br>
Attend upon them <mark3>still.</mark3><br>
<br>
But now they drift on the still <mark1>water,</mark1><br>
Mysterious, <mark4>beautiful;</mark4><br>
Among what rushes will they <mark4>build,</mark4><br>
By what lake's edge or <mark4>pool</mark4><br>
Delight men's eyes when I awake some <mark3>day</mark3><br>
To find they have flown <mark3>away?</mark3><br>
