Title : MAY. [1748] III Month. <br>
Author : Benjamin Franklin <br><br>

Read much; the Mind, which never can be <mark3>still,</mark3><br>
If not intent on Good, is prone to <mark3>Ill.</mark3><br>
And where bright Thoughts, or Reas'nings just you <mark3>find,</mark3><br>
Repose them careful in your inmost <mark3>Mind.</mark3><br>
To deck his Chloe's Bosom thus the <mark3>Swain</mark3><br>
With pleasing Toil surveys th'enamel'd <mark3>Plain,</mark3><br>
With Care selects each fragrant flow'r he <mark3>meets,</mark3><br>
And forms one Garland of their mingled <mark3>sweets.</mark3><br>
