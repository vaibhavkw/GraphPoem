Title : Triolet on a Line Apocryphally Attributed to Martin Luther<br>
Author : A. E. Stallings<br><br>

Why should the Devil get all the good <mark3>tunes,</mark3><br>
The booze and the neon and Saturday <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
The swaying in darkness, the lovers like <mark3>spoons?</mark3><br>
Why should the Devil get all the good <mark1>tunes?</mark1><br>
Does he hum them to while away sad <mark3>afternoons</mark3><br>
And the long, lonesome Sundays? Or sing them for <mark3>spite?</mark3><br>
Why should the Devil get all the good <mark1>tunes,</mark1><br>
The booze and the neon and Saturday <mark1>night?</mark1><br>
