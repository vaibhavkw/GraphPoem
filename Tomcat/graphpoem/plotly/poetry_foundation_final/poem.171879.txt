Then it was the future, though what's <mark4>arrived</mark4><br>
isn't what we had in <mark4>mind</mark4>, all chrome <mark4>and</mark4><br>
cybernetics, when we set up <mark4>exhibits</mark4><br>
in the cafeteria for the <mark4>judges</mark4><br>
to review what we'd made of our <mark4>hypotheses.</mark4><br>
<br>
The class skeptic (he later refused to <mark4>sign</mark4><br>
anyone's yearbook, calling it a <mark4>sentimental</mark4><br>
degradation of language) chloroformed <mark4>mice,</mark4><br>
weighing the bodies before and <mark4>after</mark4><br>
to catch the weight of the <mark4>soul,</mark4><br>
<br>
wanting to prove the <mark4>invisible</mark4><br>
real as a bagful of nails. A <mark4>girl</mark4><br>
who knew it all made cookies from euglena, <br>
a one-celled compromise between animal and <mark4>plant,</mark4><br>
she had cultured in a <mark4>flask.</mark4><br>
<br>
We're smart enough, she <mark4>concluded,</mark4><br>
to survive our mistakes, showing photos of <mark4>farmland,</mark4><br>
poisoned, gouged, <mark4>eroded</mark4>, No one <mark4>believed</mark4><br>
he really had built it when a kid no one knew   <br>
showed up with an atom smasher, confirming <mark4>that</mark4><br>
<br>
the tiniest particles could be <mark4>changed</mark4><br>
into something even harder to <mark4>break.</mark4><br>
And one whose mother had cancer (hard to admit now,   <br>
it was me) distilled the tar of <mark4>cigarettes</mark4><br>
to paint it on the backs of shaven <mark1>mice.</mark1><br>
<br>
She wanted to know what it <mark4>took,</mark4><br>
a little vial of sure malignancy, <br>
to prove a daily intake <mark4>smaller</mark4><br>
than a single aspirin could finish <br>
something as large as a life. I thought of <mark4>this</mark4><br>
<br>
because, today, the dusky seaside <mark4>sparrow</mark4><br>
became extinct. It may never be as <mark4>famous</mark4><br>
as the pterodactyl or the <mark4>dodo,</mark4><br>
but the last one died today, a <mark4>resident</mark4><br>
of Walt Disney World where now its tissue <mark4>samples</mark4><br>
<br>
lie <mark4>frozen</mark4>, in case someday we learn to <mark4>clone</mark4><br>
one from a few <mark4>cells</mark4>, Like those instant <mark4>dinosaurs</mark4><br>
that come in a gelatin capsule--just add <mark4>water</mark4><br>
and they inflate. One other thing <mark1>this</mark1><br>
brings to mind. The euglena girl won first <mark4>prize</mark4><br>
<br>
both for science and, I think, in retrospect, for hope.<br>
