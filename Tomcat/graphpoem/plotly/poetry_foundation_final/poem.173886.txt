Title : The Spider and the Ghost of the Fly <br>
Author : Vachel Lindsay <br><br>

Once I loved a <mark1>spider</mark1><br>
When I was born a <mark3>fly,</mark3><br>
A velvet-footed <mark1>spider</mark1><br>
With a gown of <mark3>rainbow-dye.</mark3><br>
She ate my wings and gloated.<br>
She bound me with a <mark3>hair.</mark3><br>
She drove me to her <mark4>parlor</mark4><br>
Above her winding <mark3>stair.</mark3><br>
To educate young <mark5>spiders</mark5><br>
She took me all <mark3>apart.</mark3><br>
My ghost came back to haunt her.<br>
I saw her eat my <mark3>heart.</mark3><br>
