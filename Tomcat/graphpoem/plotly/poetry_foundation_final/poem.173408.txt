Title : Sweet Machine <br>
Author : Mark Doty <br><br>

Glisten fretting the indigo of a <mark4>plum,</mark4><br>
silvered chalk of moth-wing <mark4>dust:</mark4><br>
<br>
the young man on the subway <mark4>platform</mark4><br>
--twenty maybe--seems almost <mark4>powdered,</mark4><br>
<br>
he is so dirty, the dust <mark4>lighter</mark4><br>
than his skin, which is <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
<br>
by a slight stretch of the <mark4>imagination,</mark4><br>
lovely. Though it's odd to <mark5>think</mark5><br>
<br>
of him that way, this shirtless <mark4>kid</mark4><br>
in hugely oversized jeans that <mark4>fall,</mark4><br>
<br>
when he <mark4>stands</mark4>, around his <mark5>thighs,</mark5><br>
exposing his skinny <mark4>ass</mark4>, He <mark4>yanks</mark4><br>
<br>
the waistband up, sits down <mark4>again,</mark4><br>
and begins to writhe, palms <mark4>roaming,</mark4><br>
<br>
uncontrollable, over his own <mark4>face,</mark4><br>
his close-cropped hair and <mark4>ears,</mark4><br>
<br>
down to his flanks, hands <mark4>disappearing</mark4><br>
inside the big jeans, <mark4>scratching</mark4><br>
<br>
and rubbing, until he collapses, <mark4>exhausted,</mark4><br>
head hanging between his <mark4>knees,</mark4><br>
<br>
and after a few seconds <mark4>starts</mark4><br>
it all up again. Does he <mark4>want</mark4><br>
<br>
to rub his own skin away? <mark3>Then</mark3><br>
I understand: what's powdering his flesh <mark4>is</mark4><br>
<br>
his flesh, the outest layer of <mark5>himself</mark5><br>
rubbed to palest chalk. He <mark4>repeats</mark4><br>
<br>
his stream of violent tableaux <br>
these might be positions of <mark4>transport,</mark4><br>
<br>
of ecstasy, except he's miserable, I <mark4>guess,</mark4><br>
and it's two in the afternoon, 96th and Broadway, <br>
<br>
and all of us waiting for the <mark4>local</mark4><br>
watch, how can we help it? <mark4>Crackhead,</mark4><br>
<br>
somebody says, but it's a whisper, a <mark4>question,</mark4><br>
and nothing answers our troubled <mark4>fascination:</mark4><br>
<br>
nothing to do but watch the pity and <mark4>terror</mark4><br>
of these <mark4>poses</mark4>, The express comes and <mark4>goes,</mark4><br>
<br>
and the brutal series grows more synaptic: <br>
these might be flashes of the <mark4>pornographic,</mark4><br>
<br>
or classical attitudes, rough trade <mark4>posing</mark4><br>
as a captive slave for Michelangelo. Our <mark4>context's</mark4><br>
<br>
neither intimate nor academic, and <mark4>nothing's</mark4><br>
supposed to be so real in the common <mark4>nowhere</mark4><br>
<br>
of the on-the-way-to, while we <mark4>wait</mark4><br>
for the 1 or the 9, strangers and <mark4>witnesses</mark4><br>
<br>
pressed knee to hem, back to <mark4>shoulder</mark4><br>
on the platforms and cars. This month, <br>
<br>
on the broad haunches of the <mark4>buses,</mark4><br>
another sleek boy's posed in multiple <mark4>shots,</mark4><br>
<br>
black underwear and lean belly laved by rivulets <br>
from a shower or stream. The photographees <br>
<br>
left him headless, his gestures <mark4>multiplied</mark4><br>
on builders' makeshift walls, page after page <br>
<br>
of blank torsos already beginning to be <mark4>inscribed:</mark4><br>
on a yard of silvery muscle six feet from Seventh Avenue <br>
<br>
someone's scrawled, in black marker: I am a <mark4>sweet</mark4><br>
suck and fuck machine. Take me home. Big <mark1>buses</mark1><br>
<br>
nose through the streets, one after the <mark4>other,</mark4><br>
bearing the model of what we're supposed to <mark1>want,</mark1><br>
<br>
and do, what we're meant to see and <mark4>need</mark4><br>
but not, unless we have the money, touch. <br>
<br>
He doesn't have the money, my <mark1>boy</mark1><br>
on the platform, and I wish .... <mark4>What?</mark4><br>
<br>
I don't know. Just today, in <mark3>traffic,</mark3><br>
one of those buses eased by my taxi window: <br>
<br>
a taut wet waist bound in black <mark4>elastic,</mark4><br>
huge, luminous emulsion <mark4>inches</mark4><br>
<br>
from my face. The endlessly reprinted <mark1>boy</mark1><br>
--is he?--could almost be this <mark4>man,</mark4><br>
<br>
whitened by his own degrading <mark4>skin,</mark4><br>
dark stone wearing the dust of the quarry. <br>
<br>
He's rubbing himself to flour, he's <mark4>giving</mark4><br>
his name back to airy nothing, I'm figuring <mark4>him</mark4><br>
<br>
on the varnished bench. Moth, <mark5>plum--hear</mark5><br>
how the imagery aestheticizes? He's <mark4>nothing</mark4><br>
<br>
as fixed as marble, and he touches <mark1>himself</mark1><br>
not for pleasure but because he can't <mark4>stop.</mark4><br>
<br>
What unthinkable train is he waiting <mark4>for?</mark4><br>
That boy on the billboard, the headless <mark1>boy,</mark1><br>
<br>
could he stop touching <mark1>himself?</mark1><br>
We're all on display in this <mark4>town,</mark4><br>
<br>
sweet machines, powerless, <mark4>consumed,</mark4><br>
just as he consumes <mark1>himself</mark1><br>
<br>
with those relentless <mark4>hands,</mark4><br>
scratching his barely hidden <mark4>center,</mark4><br>
<br>
hanging his head between his <mark1>knees,</mark1><br>
spent, before he jerks himself <mark4>up</mark4><br>
and starts all over <mark1>again.</mark1><br>
