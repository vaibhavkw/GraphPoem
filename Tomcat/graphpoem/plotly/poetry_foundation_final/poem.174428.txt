Title : Astrophil and Stella 41: Having this day my horse, my hand, my lance <br>
Author : Sir Philip Sidney <br><br>

Having this day my horse, my hand, my <mark3>lance</mark3><br>
Guided so well that I obtain'd the <mark3>prize,</mark3><br>
Both by the judgment of the English <mark3>eyes</mark3><br>
And of some sent from that sweet enemy <mark3>France;</mark3><br>
Horsemen my skill in horsemanship <mark3>advance,</mark3><br>
Town folks my strength; a daintier judge <mark3>applies</mark3><br>
His praise to sleight which from good use doth <mark3>rise;</mark3><br>
Some lucky wits impute it but to <mark3>chance;</mark3><br>
Others, because of both sides I do <mark3>take</mark3><br>
My blood from them who did excel in <mark4>this,</mark4><br>
Think Nature me a man of arms did <mark3>make.</mark3><br>
How far they shot awry! The true cause <mark4>is,</mark4><br>
Stella look'd on, and from her heav'nly <mark4>face</mark4><br>
Sent forth the beams which made so fair my <mark3>race.</mark3><br>
