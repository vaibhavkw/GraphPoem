Title : My Father in the Night Commanding No <br>
Author : Louis Simpson <br><br>

My father in the night commanding <mark3>No</mark3><br>
Has work to do. Smoke issues from his <mark4>lips;</mark4><br>
He reads in <mark4>silence.</mark4><br>
The frogs are croaking and the street lamps <mark3>glow.</mark3><br>
<br>
And then my mother winds the gramophone;   <br>
The Bride of Lammermoor begins to <mark3>shriek--</mark3><br>
Or reads a <mark1>story--</mark1><br>
About a prince, a castle, and a dragon. <br>
<br>
The moon is glittering above the <mark3>hill.</mark3><br>
I stand before the gateposts of the King-- <br>
So runs the <mark1>story</mark1><br>
Of Thule, at midnight when the mice are <mark3>still.</mark3><br>
<br>
And I have been in Thule! It has come <mark3>true--</mark3><br>
The journey and the danger of the <mark4>world,</mark4><br>
All that there <mark4>is</mark4><br>
To bear and to enjoy, endure and <mark3>do.</mark3><br>
<br>
Landscapes, seascapes ... where have I been <mark4>led?</mark4><br>
The names of cities--Paris, Venice, Rome-- <br>
Held out their <mark4>arms.</mark4><br>
A feathered god, seductive, went <mark3>ahead.</mark3><br>
<br>
Here is my house. Under a red rose <mark3>tree</mark3><br>
A child is swinging; another gravely <mark4>plays.</mark4><br>
They are not <mark4>surprised</mark4><br>
That I am here; they were expecting <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
<br>
And yet my father sits and reads in <mark1>silence,</mark1><br>
My mother sheds a tear, the moon is <mark1>still,</mark1><br>
And the dark <mark4>wind</mark4><br>
Is murmuring that nothing ever <mark4>happens.</mark4><br>
<br>
Beyond his jurisdiction as I <mark4>move</mark4><br>
Do I not prove him wrong? And yet, it's <mark1>true</mark1><br>
      They will not change <br>
There, on the stage of terror and of <mark4>love.</mark4><br>
<br>
The actors in that playhouse always <mark4>sit</mark4><br>
In fixed positions--father, mother, <mark4>child</mark4><br>
With painted <mark4>eyes.</mark4><br>
How sad it is to be a little <mark4>puppet!</mark4><br>
<br>
Their heads are wooden. And you once <mark4>pretended</mark4><br>
To understand them! Shake them as you <mark3>will,</mark3><br>
They cannot <mark3>speak.</mark3><br>
Do what you will, the comedy is <mark3>ended.</mark3><br>
<br>
Father, why did you work? Why did you <mark3>weep,</mark3><br>
Mother? Was the story so <mark4>important?</mark4><br>
"Listen!" the <mark1>wind</mark1><br>
Said to the children, and they fell <mark3>asleep.</mark3><br>
