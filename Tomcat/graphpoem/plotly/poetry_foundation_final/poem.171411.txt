Title : Writing <br>
Author : Howard Nemerov <br><br>

The cursive crawl, the squared-off <mark4>characters</mark4><br>
these by themselves <mark4>delight</mark4>, even <mark4>without</mark4><br>
a meaning, in a foreign language, <mark4>in</mark4><br>
Chinese, for instance, or when skaters curve   <br>
all day across the lake, scoring their <mark4>white</mark4><br>
records in ice. Being <mark4>intelligible,</mark4><br>
these winding ways with their audacities   <br>
and delicate hesitations, they <mark4>become</mark4><br>
miraculous, so intimately, out <mark5>there</mark5><br>
at the pen's point or brush's tip, do <mark1>world</mark1><br>
and spirit wed. The small bones of the <mark4>wrist</mark4><br>
balance against great skeletons of <mark4>stars</mark4><br>
exactly; the blind bat surveys his way   <br>
by echo alone. <mark4>Still</mark4>, the point of <mark4>style</mark4><br>
is character. The universe <mark4>induces</mark4><br>
a different tremor in every hand, from <mark5>the</mark5><br>
check-forger's to that of the Emperor <br>
Hui Tsung, who called his own <mark4>calligraphy</mark4><br>
the 'Slender Gold.' A nervous <mark4>man</mark4><br>
writes nervously of a nervous world, and so <mark4>on.</mark4><br>
<br>
Miraculous. It is as though the <mark1>world</mark1><br>
were a great writing. Having said so much,   <br>
let us allow there is more to the <mark1>world</mark1><br>
than writing: continental faults are <mark4>not</mark4><br>
bare convoluted fissures in the <mark4>brain.</mark4><br>
Not only must the skaters soon go <mark4>home;</mark4><br>
also the hard inscription of their skates <br>
is scored across the open water, which long   <br>
remembers nothing, neither wind nor wake.<br>
