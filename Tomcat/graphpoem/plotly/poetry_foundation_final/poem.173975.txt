Title : Modern Love: XXXIV <br>
Author : George Meredith <br><br>

Madam would speak with me. So, now it <mark3>comes:</mark3><br>
The Deluge or else Fire! She's well, she <mark4>thanks</mark4><br>
My husbandship. Our chain on silence clanks.<br>
Time leers between, above his twiddling <mark3>thumbs.</mark3><br>
Am I quite well? Most excellent in <mark3>health!</mark3><br>
The journals, too, I diligently <mark4>peruse.</mark4><br>
Vesuvius is expected to give <mark3>news:</mark3><br>
Niagara is no noisier. By <mark3>stealth</mark3><br>
Our eyes dart scrutinizing snakes. She's <mark3>glad</mark3><br>
I'm happy, says her quivering <mark3>under-lip.</mark3><br>
"And are not you?" "How can I be?" "Take <mark3>ship!</mark3><br>
For happiness is somewhere to be <mark3>had."</mark3><br>
"Nowhere for me!" Her voice is barely <mark4>heard.</mark4><br>
I am not melted, and make no pretence.<br>
With commonplace I freeze her, tongue and <mark4>sense.</mark4><br>
Niagara or Vesuvius is <mark3>deferred.</mark3><br>
