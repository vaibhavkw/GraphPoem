Title : Stonehenge <br>
Author : Albert Goldbarth <br><br>

Each morning he'd anoint the room's four <mark4>corners</mark4><br>
with an arc of piss, and <mark5>then--until</mark5><br>
he was forcibly halted--beat his forehead <mark4>open</mark4><br>
on the eastern <mark1>wall</mark1>, the "sunrise <mark1>wall,"</mark1><br>
incanting a doggerel prayer about <mark4>God</mark4><br>
the Flower, God of the Hot Plucked Heart; <mark4>and</mark4><br>
she, if loose in the halls, would join <mark4>him,</mark4><br>
squatting in the center of the room and masturbating <br>
with a stolen bar of soap. This isn't <mark3>why</mark3><br>
they were sent to the madhouse: this is <mark4>what</mark4><br>
they needed to do once in the madhouse: <mark4>this</mark4><br>
is the only meaningful ritual they could <mark4>fashion</mark4><br>
there, created from the few, make-do <br>
materials available. It isn't wondrous strange <br>
more than the mega-boozhwah formulaic <mark4>splendor</mark4><br>
of my sister's wedding ten, eleven years ago: <br>
her opulent bouquet of plastic <mark4>flowers</mark4><br>
(for the wilting pour of wattage at the photo <mark4>session),</mark4><br>
nigglingly arranged to match the real bouquet <br>
she carried down the aisle, bloom per <mark4>bloom;</mark4><br>
the five-foot Taj Mahal of sculpted pastel <mark4>sherbet;</mark4><br>
endless "Fiddler on the Roof"; I'm <mark4>sorry</mark4><br>
now I cranked my academic sneer hauteur in <mark4>place</mark4><br>
all night. I'm sorry I didn't lose <mark4>myself</mark4><br>
like a drunken bee in a room-sized <mark4>rose,</mark4><br>
in waltzing Auntie Sally to the lush <mark4>swell</mark4><br>
of the band. We need this thing. There's not <mark4>one</mark4><br>
mineral in Stonehenge that our blood can't also <mark4>raise.</mark4><br>
One dusk, one vividly <mark4>contusion-color</mark4><br>
dusk, with my fists in my pockets <mark1>and</mark1><br>
a puzzle of fish-rib clouds in the <mark3>sky</mark3>, <mark3>I</mark3><br>
stopped at the low-level glow of a basement window <br>
(Hot Good Noodle Shop) and furtively looked <mark4>in:</mark4><br>
a full-grown pig was splayed on the <mark4>table,</mark4><br>
stunned but fitfully twitching, it looked as <mark4>if</mark4><br>
it had grasshoppers under its <mark4>skin</mark4>, A man and a <mark4>woman</mark4><br>
slit that body jaw-to-ass with an ornate <mark4>knife,</mark4><br>
and then they both scooped out a <mark4>tumble</mark4><br>
of many dozens of wasps, <mark4>preserved</mark4><br>
by the oils of living pig to a beautiful black and <mark4>amber</mark4><br>
gem-like sheen. I saw it. Did <mark1>I</mark1><br>
see it? From inside <mark4>this</mark4>, over their <mark4>wrists</mark4><br>
in the tripes, they carefully <mark4>removed</mark4><br>
the wooden doll of a man and the wooden doll of a <mark1>woman</mark1><br>
maybe two inches tall, a tiny lacquered <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
and matching brass coin of a <mark4>moon</mark4>, and <mark4>then</mark4><br>
a child's-third-grade-version of a <mark4>house</mark4><br>
made out of pallid wax: a square of <mark4>walls,</mark4><br>
a pyramid roof, and a real smoking <mark4>chimney.</mark4><br>
