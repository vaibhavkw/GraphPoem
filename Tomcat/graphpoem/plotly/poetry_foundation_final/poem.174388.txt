Title : Hellas: Chorus <br>
Author : Percy Bysshe Shelley <br><br>

<br>
The world's great age begins <mark3>anew,</mark3><br>
The golden years <mark4>return,</mark4><br>
The earth doth like a snake <mark3>renew</mark3><br>
         Her winter weeds outworn: <br>
Heaven smiles, and faiths and empires <mark3>gleam</mark3><br>
Like wrecks of a dissolving <mark3>dream.</mark3><br>
<br>
A brighter Hellas rears its <mark3>mountains</mark3><br>
From waves serener <mark3>far;</mark3><br>
A new Peneus rolls his <mark3>fountains</mark3><br>
Against the morning <mark3>star.</mark3><br>
Where fairer Tempes bloom, there <mark3>sleep</mark3><br>
Young Cyclads on a sunnier <mark3>deep.</mark3><br>
<br>
A loftier Argo cleaves the <mark4>main,</mark4><br>
Fraught with a later <mark4>prize;</mark4><br>
Another Orpheus sings <mark3>again,</mark3><br>
And loves, and weeps, and <mark3>dies.</mark3><br>
A new Ulysses leaves once <mark4>more</mark4><br>
Calypso for his native <mark3>shore.</mark3><br>
<br>
Oh, write no more the tale of <mark3>Troy,</mark3><br>
If earth Death's scroll must <mark3>be!</mark3><br>
Nor mix with Laian rage the <mark3>joy</mark3><br>
Which dawns upon the <mark3>free:</mark3><br>
Although a subtler Sphinx <mark1>renew</mark1><br>
Riddles of death Thebes never <mark3>knew.</mark3><br>
<br>
Another Athens shall <mark3>arise,</mark3><br>
And to remoter <mark4>time</mark4><br>
Bequeath, like sunset to the <mark3>skies,</mark3><br>
The splendour of its <mark3>prime;</mark3><br>
And <mark4>leave</mark4>, if nought so bright may <mark4>live,</mark4><br>
All earth can take or Heaven can <mark3>give.</mark3><br>
<br>
Saturn and Love their long <mark4>repose</mark4><br>
         Shall burst, more bright and good <br>
Than all who fell, than One who <mark3>rose,</mark3><br>
         Than many unsubdu'd: <br>
Not gold, not blood, their altar <mark4>dowers,</mark4><br>
But votive tears and symbol <mark4>flowers.</mark4><br>
<br>
Oh cease! must hate and death <mark1>return?</mark1><br>
Cease! must men kill and <mark5>die?</mark5><br>
Cease! drain not to its dregs the <mark3>urn</mark3><br>
Of bitter <mark4>prophecy.</mark4><br>
The world is weary of the <mark3>past,</mark3><br>
Oh might it die or rest at <mark3>last!</mark3><br>
