Title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 126 <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

Love is and was my Lord and <mark3>King,</mark3><br>
And in his presence I <mark3>attend</mark3><br>
To hear the tidings of my <mark3>friend,</mark3><br>
Which every hour his couriers <mark3>bring.</mark3><br>
<br>
Love is and was my King and <mark4>Lord,</mark4><br>
And will be, tho' as yet I <mark3>keep</mark3><br>
Within his court on earth, and <mark3>sleep</mark3><br>
Encompass'd by his faithful <mark4>guard,</mark4><br>
<br>
And hear at times a <mark4>sentinel</mark4><br>
Who moves about from place to <mark3>place,</mark3><br>
And whispers to the worlds of <mark3>space,</mark3><br>
In the deep night, that all is <mark4>well.</mark4><br>
