Title : From This Height <br>
Author : Tony Hoagland <br><br>

Cold wind comes out of the white <mark4>hills</mark4><br>
and rubs itself against the walls of the <mark4>condominium</mark4><br>
with an esophogeal vowel <mark4>sound,</mark4><br>
and a loneliness <mark4>creeps</mark4><br>
into the conversation by the hot tub. <br>
<br>
We don't deserve <mark4>pleasure</mark4><br>
just as we don't deserve <mark4>pain,</mark4><br>
but it's pure sorcery the way the feathers of warm <mark3>mist</mark3><br>
keep rising from the surface of the <mark4>water</mark4><br>
to wrap themselves around a <mark4>sculpted</mark4><br>
clavicle or <mark3>wrist.</mark3><br>
<br>
It's not just that we are <mark4>on</mark4><br>
the eighth story of the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
looking out through glass and <mark4>steel</mark4><br>
with a clarity of <mark4>vision</mark4><br>
in which imported coffee <mark4>and</mark4><br>
a knowledge of French <mark5>painting</mark5><br>
are <mark4>combined,</mark4><br>
<br>
but that we are atop a <mark4>pyramid</mark4><br>
of all the facts that make this <mark4>possible:</mark4><br>
the furnace that heats the <mark1>water,</mark1><br>
the truck that hauled the <mark4>fuel,</mark4><br>
the artery of highway <br>
blasted through the <mark4>mountains,</mark4><br>
<br>
the heart attack of the previous <mark4>owner,</mark4><br>
the history of Western <mark4>medicine</mark4><br>
that failed to save <mark4>him,</mark4><br>
the successful development of <mark4>tourism,</mark4><br>
the snow white lotions that counteract the <mark4>chemistry</mark4><br>
of chlorine upon skin--our <mark4>skin.</mark4><br>
<br>
Down inside history's <mark4>body,</mark4><br>
the slaves are still singing in the dark;   <br>
the roads continue to be <mark4>built;</mark4><br>
the wind blows and the building grips itself   <br>
in anticipation of the next strong <mark4>gust.</mark4><br>
<br>
So an enormous act of forgetting is <mark4>required</mark4><br>
simply to kiss <mark4>someone</mark4><br>
or to open your <mark5>mouth</mark5><br>
for the fork of high-calorie <mark4>pate</mark4><br>
someone is raising to your <mark4>lips,</mark4><br>
<br>
which, considering the <mark4>price,</mark4><br>
it would be a <mark4>sin</mark4><br>
not to enjoy.<br>
