Title : Gitanjali 35 <br>
Author : Rabindranath Tagore <br><br>

Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high; <br>
   Where knowledge is free; <br>
   Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; <br>
   Where words come out from the depth of truth; <br>
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards <mark4>perfection;</mark4><br>
   Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; <br>
Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and <mark4>action</mark4><br>
   Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.<br>
