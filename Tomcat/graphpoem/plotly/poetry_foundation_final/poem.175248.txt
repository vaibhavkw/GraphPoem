Title : Eros <br>
Author : Robert Bridges <br><br>

Why hast thou nothing in thy <mark3>face?</mark3><br>
Thou idol of the human <mark3>race,</mark3><br>
Thou tyrant of the human <mark3>heart,</mark3><br>
The flower of lovely youth that <mark3>art;</mark3><br>
Yea, and that standest in thy <mark3>youth</mark3><br>
An image of eternal <mark3>Truth,</mark3><br>
With thy exuberant flesh so <mark3>fair,</mark3><br>
That only Pheidias might <mark3>compare,</mark3><br>
Ere from his chaste marmoreal <mark3>form</mark3><br>
Time had decayed the colours <mark3>warm;</mark3><br>
Like to his gods in thy proud <mark4>dress,</mark4><br>
Thy starry sheen of nakedness. <br>
<br>
Surely thy body is thy <mark3>mind,</mark3><br>
For in thy face is nought to <mark3>find,</mark3><br>
Only thy soft unchristen'd <mark3>smile,</mark3><br>
That shadows neither love nor <mark3>guile,</mark3><br>
But shameless will and power <mark4>immense,</mark4><br>
In secret sensuous <mark4>innocence.</mark4><br>
<br>
O king of joy, what is thy <mark4>thought?</mark4><br>
I dream thou knowest it is nought, <br>
And wouldst in darkness come, but <mark5>thou</mark5><br>
Makest the light where'er thou go. <br>
Ah yet no victim of thy <mark4>grace,</mark4><br>
None who e'er long'd for thy <mark3>embrace,</mark3><br>
Hath cared to look upon thy <mark1>face.</mark1><br>
