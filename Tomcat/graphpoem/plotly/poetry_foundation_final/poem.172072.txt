Title : The Woman Who Laughed on Calvary <br>
Author : Heather McHugh <br><br>

<br>
Smilers, smirkers, chucklers, grinners,   <br>
platitudinizers, euphemists: it wasn't <mark5>you</mark5><br>
I emulated there, in <mark4>that</mark4><br>
<br>
Godawful place. What <mark3>kind</mark3><br>
of <mark4>face</mark4><br>
to put on it? How <mark4>simple</mark4><br>
<br>
is a simon's sign? To my <mark3>mind</mark3><br>
laughter's not the mark of pleasure, <mark4>not</mark4><br>
a pleasantry that <mark3>spread</mark3>, <mark4>instead</mark4><br>
it's intimate with <mark4>sheer</mark4><br>
<br>
delirium: spilt <mark1>brain</mark1><br>
on split lip, uncontainable <br>
(make no mistake, it is a horror, <mark4>this</mark4><br>
<br>
inmated, <mark4>intimated</mark4><br>
<br>
self, revealed as <mark4>your</mark4><br>
material: red <mark4>smear,</mark4><br>
white swipe). It's said the <mark1>brain</mark1><br>
stinks first, then organworks of art and <mark4>eatery,</mark4><br>
and then--what's left? a little cartilage <mark4>for</mark4><br>
ambiguity? a little tendon's B&D? At <mark4>last</mark4>, the <mark4>least</mark4><br>
<br>
ephemeral of evidences: nuggetworks (discrete, <mark4>and</mark4><br>
indiscreet) of teeth, <mark4>bone-bits</mark4>, odd <mark4>scraps</mark4><br>
of a delapidated strut--and this is <mark4>just</mark4><br>
the sort of stuff, <mark5>insensate,</mark5><br>
to which life (which comes <mark3>again</mark3><br>
as slime) has <mark4>always</mark4><br>
<br>
loved adhering. Life! Who <mark4>wouldn't</mark4><br>
laugh? Your inner life! Your <mark4>pet</mark4><br>
pretense! It can't be kept up, <mark4>can't</mark4><br>
be kept <mark4>clean,</mark4><br>
even in a <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
except a <mark4>good</mark4><br>
bloodworks or shitpump keeps it so. <br>
Out of the mouth comes a <mark4>tongue,</mark4><br>
<br>
it calls itself linguistic and <mark4>it</mark4><br>
<br>
never quite <mark4>effects</mark4><br>
the cover-up (good <br>
Lord, there's much <mark3>to</mark3><br>
cover up: so many belches, <mark4>outcries,</mark4><br>
upchucks, sneezes, puffings, hiccups, osculations, hawks <mark1>and</mark1><br>
so laughter (which, among the noises, prides <mark4>itself</mark4><br>
on being the most intellectual) can't help   <br>
<br>
but come out, <mark4>snorting</mark4>, <mark4>Nothing</mark4><br>
smiled or mild or meanwhiling--a <mark4>laugh's</mark4><br>
got teeth to send it <mark4>off,</mark4><br>
and spit to keep it company, and <mark4>rot</mark4><br>
<br>
to end up with. Its closest kin is <mark4>grimace</mark4>, <mark4>it's</mark4><br>
a grimacing with <mark4>wind.</mark4><br>
It will (the <mark4>will</mark4><br>
be <mark4>damned)</mark4><br>
burst <mark4>out</mark4><br>
in bad cacaphonies <mark4>of</mark4><br>
brouhaha and borborygma--it's <mark4>the</mark4><br>
stockbroker of mockeries, a trachea rake-- <br>
<br>
the vent of rage and irony, and <mark4>right</mark4><br>
there in the <mark4>very</mark4><br>
shrine of signs. A laugh, I <mark3>mean,</mark3><br>
is <mark4>sorrow's</mark4><br>
archery and <mark4>signature,</mark4><br>
while flesh is <mark4>being</mark4><br>
hoisted and <mark4>arrayed</mark4><br>
<br>
on roosts of <mark4>skeleton.</mark4><br>
I saw what <mark1>good</mark1><br>
comes to; I saw the <mark4>figure</mark4><br>
<br>
human being cuts, upon its frame.   <br>
<br>
The laugh was a cry from my <mark4>own</mark4><br>
<br>
perscrewed, misnailed, <mark4>cross-crafted</mark4><br>
<br>
armature. <mark3>Despite</mark3><br>
your consternations, oh <mark1>you</mark1><br>
meekened warners and <mark3>polite</mark3><br>
<br>
conventioneers, the thieves were <mark4>better</mark4><br>
served upon that day. For the <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
<br>
is a muscle, where cruelty's <mark4>humored.</mark4><br>
The tooth of moral <mark4>rectitude's</mark4><br>
a fang. What I <mark4>gave</mark4><br>
at the sight of him <mark4>there</mark4><br>
<br>
was up. What I <mark4>got</mark4><br>
of humanity <mark1>there</mark1><br>
was the hang . . <mark4>.</mark4><br>
