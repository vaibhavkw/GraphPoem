Title : A Shropshire Lad 12: When I watch the living meet <br>
Author : A. E. Housman <br><br>

When I watch the living <mark3>meet,</mark3><br>
And the moving pageant <mark3>file</mark3><br>
Warm and breathing through the <mark3>street</mark3><br>
Where I lodge a little <mark3>while,</mark3><br>
<br>
If the heats of hate and <mark4>lust</mark4><br>
In the house of flesh are <mark5>strong,</mark5><br>
Let me mind the house of <mark3>dust</mark3><br>
Where my sojourn shall be <mark3>long.</mark3><br>
<br>
In the nation that is <mark4>not</mark4><br>
Nothing stands that stood <mark3>before;</mark3><br>
There revenges are <mark3>forgot,</mark3><br>
And the hater hates no <mark3>more;</mark3><br>
<br>
Lovers lying two and <mark3>two</mark3><br>
Ask not whom they sleep <mark3>beside,</mark3><br>
And the bridegroom all night <mark3>through</mark3><br>
Never turns him to the <mark3>bride.</mark3><br>
