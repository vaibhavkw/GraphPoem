Title : I Shall not Care <br>
Author : Sara Teasdale <br><br>

When I am dead and over me bright <mark4>April</mark4><br>
Shakes out her rain-drenched <mark3>hair,</mark3><br>
Tho' you should lean above me <mark3>broken-hearted,</mark3><br>
I shall not <mark3>care.</mark3><br>
<br>
I shall have peace, as leafy trees are <mark4>peaceful</mark4><br>
When rain bends down the <mark3>bough,</mark3><br>
And I shall be more silent and <mark3>cold-hearted</mark3><br>
Than you are <mark3>now.</mark3><br>
