Title : More Than Enough <br>
Author : Marge Piercy <br><br>

The first lily of June opens its red mouth. <br>
All over the sand road where we walk <br>
multiflora rose climbs trees cascading <br>
white or pink blossoms, simple, intense <br>
the scene drifting like colored mist. <br>
<br>
The arrowhead is spreading its <mark4>creamy</mark4><br>
clumps of flower and the blackberries <br>
are blooming in the thickets. Season of <br>
joy for the bee. The green will never <br>
again be so green, so purely and <mark4>lushly</mark4><br>
<br>
new, grass lifting its wheaty seedheads <br>
into the wind. Rich fresh wine <br>
of June, we stagger into you <mark4>smeared</mark4><br>
with pollen, overcome as the turtle <br>
laying her eggs in roadside <mark4>sand.</mark4><br>
