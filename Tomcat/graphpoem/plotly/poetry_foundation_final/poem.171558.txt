Title : Jazz Station <br>
Author : Michael S. Harper <br><br>

for sandy and henry carlile  Some great musicians got no place to <mark5>play</mark5><br>
Above the freeway, over the <mark4>music,</mark4><br>
we speak of the strategy of <mark4>poems,</mark4><br>
bleeding wives who ulcerate <br>
our voices rhythming in the <mark4>cut-heat</mark4><br>
Portland stink from the Willamette <mark4>River;</mark4><br>
arteries of smog fixate this <mark5>place</mark5><br>
in each recording, music, music, on <mark4>Impulse.</mark4><br>
This little racist community has few <mark4>friends;</mark4><br>
thousands of deerslayers hum into <mark4>Beaverton,</mark4><br>
the one talk show driven out for their <mark4>talk</mark4><br>
as the liberals dig in to KGO out of San Francisco;   <br>
we troop toward the Lloyd Center for the ice-skating, <br>
the colorette bloomered dream merchants on rented <mark4>skates,</mark4><br>
and the Sunday Chronicle near the big hotel. <br>
<br>
The poets, man and wife, write in the dimming air, <br>
their daughter in the toy rooms connecting them, <br>
the typewriter tacking the nails and snaps of her <mark4>gown.</mark4><br>
This image of separation begins in <mark4>adoption:</mark4><br>
her mother adopted out in San Jose; her <mark4>father</mark4><br>
disowned, abandoned, torn out of the will; her name: Phoebe. <br>
<br>
And the sun does shine on them for this <mark4>visit</mark4><br>
in squat pigeontoes, and this beach ball <mark4>sings.</mark4><br>
