Title : Hymn to Intellectual Beauty <br>
Author : Percy Bysshe Shelley <br><br>

The awful shadow of some unseen <mark3>Power</mark3><br>
Floats though unseen among us; <mark4>visiting</mark4><br>
This various world with as inconstant <mark4>wing</mark4><br>
As summer winds that creep from flower to <mark3>flower;</mark3><br>
Like moonbeams that behind some piny mountain <mark3>shower,</mark3><br>
It visits with inconstant <mark4>glance</mark4><br>
Each human heart and <mark4>countenance;</mark4><br>
Like hues and harmonies of <mark4>evening,</mark4><br>
Like clouds in starlight widely <mark3>spread,</mark3><br>
Like memory of music <mark3>fled,</mark3><br>
Like aught that for its grace may <mark4>be</mark4><br>
Dear, and yet dearer for its <mark4>mystery.</mark4><br>
<br>
Spirit of BEAUTY, that dost <mark4>consecrate</mark4><br>
With thine own hues all thou dost shine <mark4>upon</mark4><br>
Of human thought or form, where art thou <mark4>gone?</mark4><br>
Why dost thou pass away and leave our <mark4>state,</mark4><br>
This dim vast vale of tears, vacant and <mark4>desolate?</mark4><br>
Ask why the sunlight not for <mark4>ever</mark4><br>
Weaves rainbows o'er yon <mark4>mountain-river,</mark4><br>
Why aught should fail and fade that once is <mark4>shown,</mark4><br>
Why fear and dream and death and <mark3>birth</mark3><br>
Cast on the daylight of this <mark3>earth</mark3><br>
Such gloom, why man has such a <mark3>scope</mark3><br>
For love and hate, despondency and <mark3>hope?</mark3><br>
<br>
No voice from some sublimer world hath <mark1>ever</mark1><br>
To sage or poet these responses <mark4>given:</mark4><br>
Therefore the names of Demon, Ghost, and <mark4>Heaven,</mark4><br>
Remain the records of their vain <mark3>endeavour:</mark3><br>
Frail spells whose utter'd charm might not avail to <mark3>sever,</mark3><br>
From all we hear and all we <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
                Doubt, chance and mutability. <br>
Thy light alone like mist o'er mountains <mark4>driven,</mark4><br>
Or music by the night-wind <mark4>sent</mark4><br>
Through strings of some still <mark4>instrument,</mark4><br>
Or moonlight on a midnight <mark3>stream,</mark3><br>
Gives grace and truth to life's unquiet <mark3>dream.</mark3><br>
<br>
Love, Hope, and Self-esteem, like clouds <mark4>depart</mark4><br>
And come, for some uncertain moments <mark4>lent.</mark4><br>
Man were immortal and <mark4>omnipotent,</mark4><br>
Didst thou, unknown and awful as thou <mark4>art,</mark4><br>
Keep with thy glorious train firm state within his <mark3>heart.</mark3><br>
Thou messenger of <mark4>sympathies,</mark4><br>
That wax and wane in lovers' <mark4>eyes;</mark4><br>
Thou, that to human thought art <mark4>nourishment,</mark4><br>
Like darkness to a dying <mark4>flame!</mark4><br>
Depart not as thy shadow <mark3>came,</mark3><br>
Depart not--lest the grave should <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
Like life and fear, a dark reality. <br>
<br>
While yet a boy I sought for ghosts, and <mark3>sped</mark3><br>
Through many a listening chamber, cave and <mark4>ruin,</mark4><br>
And starlight wood, with fearful steps <mark4>pursuing</mark4><br>
Hopes of high talk with the departed <mark3>dead.</mark3><br>
I call'd on poisonous names with which our youth is <mark3>fed;</mark3><br>
I was not heard; I saw them <mark4>not;</mark4><br>
When musing deeply on the <mark3>lot</mark3><br>
Of life, at that sweet time when winds are <mark3>wooing</mark3><br>
All vital things that wake to <mark4>bring</mark4><br>
News of birds and <mark4>blossoming,</mark4><br>
Sudden, thy shadow fell on <mark3>me;</mark3><br>
I shriek'd, and clasp'd my hands in <mark4>ecstasy!</mark4><br>
<br>
I vow'd that I would dedicate my <mark4>powers</mark4><br>
To thee and thine: have I not kept the <mark3>vow?</mark3><br>
With beating heart and streaming eyes, even <mark3>now</mark3><br>
I call the phantoms of a thousand <mark3>hours</mark3><br>
Each from his voiceless grave: they have in vision'd <mark3>bowers</mark3><br>
Of studious zeal or love's <mark4>delight</mark4><br>
Outwatch'd with me the envious <mark3>night:</mark3><br>
They know that never joy illum'd my <mark3>brow</mark3><br>
Unlink'd with hope that thou wouldst <mark3>free</mark3><br>
This world from its dark <mark4>slavery,</mark4><br>
                That thou, O awful LOVELINESS, <br>
Wouldst give whate'er these words cannot <mark4>express.</mark4><br>
<br>
The day becomes more solemn and <mark4>serene</mark4><br>
When noon is past; there is a <mark4>harmony</mark4><br>
In autumn, and a lustre in its <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
Which through the summer is not heard or <mark3>seen,</mark3><br>
As if it could not be, as if it had not <mark4>been!</mark4><br>
Thus let thy power, which like the <mark4>truth</mark4><br>
Of nature on my passive <mark3>youth</mark3><br>
Descended, to my onward life <mark3>supply</mark3><br>
Its calm, to one who worships <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
And every form containing <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
Whom, SPIRIT fair, thy spells did <mark4>bind</mark4><br>
To fear himself, and love all human <mark3>kind.</mark3><br>
