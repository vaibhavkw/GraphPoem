Title : The Ruined Maid <br>
Author : Thomas Hardy <br><br>

"O 'Melia, my dear, this does everything <mark3>crown!</mark3><br>
Who could have supposed I should meet you in <mark3>Town?</mark3><br>
And whence such fair garments, such prosperi-ty?" <mark4>--</mark4><br>
"O didn't you know I'd been ruined?" said <mark3>she.</mark3><br>
<br>
-- "You left us in tatters, without shoes or <mark3>socks,</mark3><br>
Tired of digging potatoes, and spudding up <mark3>docks;</mark3><br>
And now you've gay bracelets and bright feathers three!" <mark3>--</mark3><br>
"Yes: that's how we dress when we're ruined," said <mark1>she.</mark1><br>
<br>
-- "At home in the barton you said thee' and <mark3>thou,'</mark3><br>
And thik oon,' and theas oon,' and t'other'; but <mark3>now</mark3><br>
Your talking quite fits 'ee for high compa-ny!" --<br>
"Some polish is gained with one's ruin," said <mark1>she.</mark1><br>
<br>
-- "Your hands were like paws then, your face blue and <mark3>bleak</mark3><br>
But now I'm bewitched by your delicate <mark3>cheek,</mark3><br>
And your little gloves fit as on any la-dy!" <mark4>--</mark4><br>
"We never do work when we're ruined," said <mark1>she.</mark1><br>
<br>
-- "You used to call home-life a hag-ridden <mark3>dream,</mark3><br>
And you'd sigh, and you'd sock; but at present you <mark3>seem</mark3><br>
To know not of megrims or melancho-ly!" <mark4>--</mark4><br>
"True. One's pretty lively when ruined," said <mark1>she.</mark1><br>
<br>
-- "I wish I had feathers, a fine sweeping <mark3>gown,</mark3><br>
And a delicate face, and could strut about Town!" <mark1>--</mark1><br>
"My dear -- a raw country girl, such as you <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
Cannot quite expect that. You ain't ruined," said <mark1>she.</mark1><br>
