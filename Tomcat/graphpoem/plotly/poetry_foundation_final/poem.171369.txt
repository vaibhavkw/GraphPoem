Title : Not Guilty <br>
Author : David Rivard <br><br>

The days are dog-eared, the edges <mark4>torn,</mark4><br>
ragged--like those <mark4>pages</mark4><br>
I ripped once out of library <mark4>books,</mark4><br>
<br>
for their <mark4>photos</mark4><br>
of Vallejo and bootless Robert <mark4>Johnson.</mark4><br>
A fine needs paying now <br>
<br>
it's true, <mark4>but</mark4><br>
not by <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
I am no more <mark5>guilty</mark5><br>
<br>
than that thrush <mark4>is</mark4><br>
who sits there stripping <mark4>moss</mark4><br>
off the wet bark of a <mark3>tree.</mark3><br>
<br>
A red fleck, like <mark4>his</mark4>, <mark4>glows</mark4><br>
at the back of my head--a beauty mark,   <br>
left by the brain's <mark4>after-jets.</mark4><br>
<br>
I would not wish for the three <mark4>brains</mark4><br>
Robert <mark4>required</mark4><br>
to double-clutch his <mark5>guitar</mark5><br>
<br>
and chase those sounds he had to know   <br>
led <mark4>down</mark4><br>
and into a troubled dusky river, <mark4>always.</mark4><br>
<br>
Three brains did Johnson no earthly <mark4>good,</mark4><br>
neither his nor Vallejo's 4 & 1/2 <br>
worked right exactly--O <mark4>bunglers,</mark4><br>
<br>
O banged-up pans of <mark4>disaster!</mark4><br>
Crying for days, said Cesar, & singing for <mark4>months.</mark4><br>
How can I be so strong some <mark4>times,</mark4><br>
<br>
at others weak? I wish to be <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
but free to do what? To leave myself <mark4>behind?</mark4><br>
To switch channels <mark4>remotely?</mark4><br>
<br>
Better to <mark4>sing.</mark4><br>
Not like the bird, but as they <mark4>sang,</mark4><br>
Cesar & <mark4>Robert--</mark4><br>
<br>
with the shocked & <mark4>seeded</mark4><br>
sweetness of an apple <br>
split open by a meat <mark4>cleaver.</mark4><br>
