Title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 44 <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

How fares it with the happy <mark3>dead?</mark3><br>
For here the man is more and <mark3>more;</mark3><br>
But he forgets the days <mark3>before</mark3><br>
God shut the doorways of his <mark3>head.</mark3><br>
<br>
The days have vanish'd, tone and <mark3>tint,</mark3><br>
And yet perhaps the hoarding <mark3>sense</mark3><br>
Gives out at times (he knows not <mark3>whence)</mark3><br>
A little flash, a mystic <mark3>hint;</mark3><br>
<br>
And in the long harmonious <mark4>years</mark4><br>
(If Death so taste Lethean <mark4>springs),</mark4><br>
May some dim touch of earthly <mark3>things</mark3><br>
Surprise thee ranging with thy <mark4>peers.</mark4><br>
<br>
If such a dreamy touch should <mark3>fall,</mark3><br>
O turn thee round, resolve the <mark4>doubt;</mark4><br>
My guardian angel will speak <mark3>out</mark3><br>
In that high place, and tell thee <mark3>all.</mark3><br>
