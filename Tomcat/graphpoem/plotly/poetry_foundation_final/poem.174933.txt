<br>
Tulsidas, the poet, was wandering, deep in thought, by the Ganges, in that lonely spot where they burn their <mark4>dead.</mark4><br>
He found a woman sitting at the feet of the corpse of her dead husband, gaily dressed as for a wedding.<br>
She rose as she saw him, bowed to him, and said, "Permit me, Master, with your blessing, to follow my husband to <mark1>heaven."</mark1><br>
"Why such hurry, my daughter?" asked Tulsidas. "Is not this earth also His who made <mark1>heaven?"</mark1><br>
"For heaven I do not long," said the woman. "I want my <mark4>husband."</mark4><br>
Tulsidas smiled and said to her, "Go back to your home, my <mark4>child</mark4>, Before the month is over you will find your <mark1>husband."</mark1><br>
The woman went back with glad hope. Tulsidas came to her every day and gave her high thoughts to think, till her heart was filled to the brim with divine <mark4>love.</mark4><br>
When the month was scarcely over, her neighbours came to her, asking, "Woman, have you found your <mark1>husband?"</mark1><br>
The widow smiled and said, "I <mark4>have."</mark4><br>
Eagerly they asked, "Where is he?"<br>
"In my heart is my lord, one with me," said the <mark4>woman.</mark4><br>
