Title : Epitaph on Elizabeth, L. H. <br>
Author : Ben Jonson <br><br>

Wouldst thou hear what man can <mark3>say</mark3><br>
In a little? Reader, <mark3>stay.</mark3><br>
Underneath this stone doth <mark3>lie</mark3><br>
As much beauty as could <mark3>die;</mark3><br>
Which in life did harbour <mark3>give</mark3><br>
To more virtue than doth <mark3>live.</mark3><br>
If at all she had a <mark3>fault,</mark3><br>
Leave it buried in this <mark3>vault.</mark3><br>
One name was <mark4>Elizabeth,</mark4><br>
Th' other let it sleep with <mark4>death:</mark4><br>
Fitter, where it died to <mark3>tell,</mark3><br>
Than that it liv'd at <mark4>all</mark4>, <mark3>Farewell.</mark3><br>
