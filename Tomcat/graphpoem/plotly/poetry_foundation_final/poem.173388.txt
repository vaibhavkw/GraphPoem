Title : A Valediction: of Weeping <br>
Author : John Donne <br><br>

Let me pour <mark4>forth</mark4><br>
My tears before thy face, whilst I stay <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
For thy face coins them, and thy stamp they <mark4>bear,</mark4><br>
And by this mintage they are something <mark4>worth,</mark4><br>
For thus they <mark3>be</mark3><br>
Pregnant of <mark3>thee;</mark3><br>
Fruits of much grief they <mark4>are</mark4>, emblems of <mark4>more,</mark4><br>
When a tear falls, that thou falls which it <mark3>bore,</mark3><br>
So thou and I are nothing then, when on a diverse <mark3>shore.</mark3><br>
<br>
On a round <mark3>ball</mark3><br>
A workman that hath copies by, can lay <br>
An Europe, Afric, and an Asia, <br>
And quickly make that, which was nothing, <mark3>all;</mark3><br>
So doth each <mark4>tear</mark4><br>
Which thee doth <mark3>wear,</mark3><br>
A globe, yea world, by that impression <mark3>grow,</mark3><br>
Till thy tears mix'd with mine do <mark3>overflow</mark3><br>
This world; by waters sent from thee, my heaven dissolved <mark3>so.</mark3><br>
<br>
O more than <mark3>moon,</mark3><br>
Draw not up seas to drown me in thy <mark4>sphere,</mark4><br>
Weep me not dead, in thine arms, but <mark5>forbear</mark5><br>
To teach the sea what it may do too <mark3>soon;</mark3><br>
Let not the <mark3>wind</mark3><br>
Example <mark3>find,</mark3><br>
To do me more harm than it purposeth; <br>
Since thou and I sigh one another's <mark4>breath,</mark4><br>
Whoe'er sighs most is cruellest, and hastes the other's <mark3>death.</mark3><br>
