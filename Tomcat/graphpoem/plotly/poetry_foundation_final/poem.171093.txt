Title : Stable <br>
Author : Claudia Emerson <br><br>

One rusty horseshoe hangs on a <mark4>nail</mark4><br>
above the door, still losing its luck, <br>
and a work-collar swings, an <mark4>empty</mark4><br>
old noose. The silence waits, wild to <mark4>be</mark4><br>
broken by hoofbeat and <mark4>heavy</mark4><br>
harness slap, will founder but remain; <br>
while, outside, above the <mark4>stable,</mark4><br>
eight, nine, now ten buzzards swing low <br>
in lazy loops, a loose black warp <br>
of patience, bearing the blank sky <br>
like a pall of wind on mourning <br>
wings. But the bones of this place are <br>
long picked clean. Only the hayrake's <br>
ribs still rise from the rampant grasses.<br>
