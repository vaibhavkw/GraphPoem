Title : The Inkspots <br>
Author : Gerald Stern <br><br>

The thing about the dove was how he cried <mark4>in</mark4><br>
my pocket and stuck his nose out just enough <mark1>to</mark1><br>
breathe some air and get some snow in his eye <mark4>and</mark4><br>
he would have snuggled in but I was <mark4>afraid</mark4><br>
and brought him into the house so he could shit <mark4>on</mark4><br>
the New York Times, still I had to kiss him   <br>
after a minute, I put my lips to his <mark4>beak</mark4><br>
and he knew what he was doing, he stretched his <mark4>neck</mark4><br>
and touched me with his open mouth, <mark4>lifting</mark4><br>
his wings a little and readjusting his legs,   <br>
loving his own prettiness, and I <mark4>just</mark4><br>
sang from one of my stupid songs from one of my   <br>
vile decades, the way I <mark3>do</mark3>, I have <mark1>to</mark1><br>
admit it was something from trains. I knew he'd like <mark4>that,</mark4><br>
resting in the coal car, slightly dusted with   <br>
mountain snow, somewhere near <mark4>Altoona,</mark4><br>
the horseshoe curve he knew so well, his <mark4>own</mark4><br>
moan matching the train's, a radio <br>
playing the Inkspots, the engineer <mark4>roaring.</mark4><br>
