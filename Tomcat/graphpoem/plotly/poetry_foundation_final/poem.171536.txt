Title : Discrimination <br>
Author : Kenneth Rexroth <br><br>

I don't mind the human <mark4>race.</mark4><br>
I've got pretty used to <mark4>them</mark4><br>
In these past twenty-five <mark4>years.</mark4><br>
I don't mind if they sit <mark4>next</mark4><br>
To me on streetcars, or <mark4>eat</mark4><br>
In the same restaurants, if   <br>
It's not at the same <mark4>table.</mark4><br>
However, I don't <mark4>approve</mark4><br>
Of a woman I <mark4>respect</mark4><br>
Dancing with one of them. <mark4>I've</mark4><br>
Tried asking them to my <mark4>home</mark4><br>
Without success. I <mark4>shouldn't</mark4><br>
Care to see my own sister   <br>
Marry one. Even if she <br>
Loved him, think of the children.   <br>
Their art is interesting,   <br>
But certainly <mark4>barbarous.</mark4><br>
I'm sure, if given a <mark4>chance,</mark4><br>
They'd kill us all in our <mark4>beds.</mark4><br>
And you must admit, they <mark4>smell.</mark4><br>
