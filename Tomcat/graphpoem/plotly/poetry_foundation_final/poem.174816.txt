Title : Scorn not the Sonnet <br>
Author : William Wordsworth <br><br>

Scorn not the Sonnet; Critic, you have <mark3>frowned,</mark3><br>
Mindless of its just honours; with this key <br>
Shakespeare unlocked his heart; the melody <br>
Of this small lute gave ease to Petrarch's <mark3>wound;</mark3><br>
A thousand times this pipe did Tasso <mark3>sound;</mark3><br>
With it Camoens soothed an exile's <mark3>grief;</mark3><br>
The Sonnet glittered a gay myrtle <mark3>leaf</mark3><br>
Amid the cypress with which Dante <mark3>crowned</mark3><br>
His visionary brow: a glow-worm <mark3>lamp,</mark3><br>
It cheered mild Spenser, called from <mark4>Faery-land</mark4><br>
To struggle through dark ways; and, when a <mark3>damp</mark3><br>
Fell round the path of Milton, in his <mark3>hand</mark3><br>
The Thing became a trumpet; whence he <mark3>blew</mark3><br>
Soul-animating strains--alas, too <mark3>few!</mark3><br>
