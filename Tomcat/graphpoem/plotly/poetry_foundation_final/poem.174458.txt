Title : Epithalamion <br>
Author : Edmund Spenser <br><br>

Ye learned sisters which have <mark4>oftentimes</mark4><br>
Beene to me ayding, others to adorne: <br>
Whom ye thought worthy of your gracefull rymes, <br>
That even the greatest did not greatly scorne <br>
To heare theyr names sung in your simple <mark5>layes,</mark5><br>
But joyed in theyr <mark5>prayse.</mark5><br>
And when ye list your owne mishaps to <mark5>mourne,</mark5><br>
Which death, or love, or fortunes wreck did <mark5>rayse,</mark5><br>
Your string could soone to sadder tenor turne, <br>
And teach the woods and waters to <mark5>lament</mark5><br>
Your dolefull <mark5>dreriment.</mark5><br>
Now lay those sorrowfull complaints <mark4>aside,</mark4><br>
And having all your heads with girland <mark5>crownd,</mark5><br>
Helpe me mine owne loves prayses to <mark4>resound,</mark4><br>
Ne let the same of any be <mark5>envide:</mark5><br>
So Orpheus did for his owne <mark4>bride,</mark4><br>
So I unto my selfe alone will <mark3>sing,</mark3><br>
The woods shall to me answer and my Eccho <mark3>ring.</mark3><br>
<br>
Early before the worlds light giving <mark5>lampe,</mark5><br>
His golden beame upon the hils doth <mark5>spred,</mark5><br>
Having disperst the nights unchearefull dampe, <br>
Doe ye awake, and with fresh lusty <mark1>hed,</mark1><br>
Go to the bowre of my beloved <mark3>love,</mark3><br>
My truest turtle <mark3>dove,</mark3><br>
Bid her <mark1>awake</mark1>, for Hymen is <mark1>awake,</mark1><br>
And long since ready forth his maske to <mark4>move,</mark4><br>
With his bright Tead that flames with many a <mark3>flake,</mark3><br>
And many a bachelor to waite on <mark3>him,</mark3><br>
In theyr fresh garments <mark3>trim.</mark3><br>
Bid her awake therefore and soone her <mark1>dight,</mark1><br>
For lo the wished day is come at <mark4>last,</mark4><br>
That shall for al the paynes and sorrowes <mark3>past,</mark3><br>
Pay to her usury of long <mark4>delight:</mark4><br>
And whylest she doth her <mark1>dight,</mark1><br>
Doe ye to her of joy and solace <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
That all the woods may answer and your eccho <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
Bring with you all the Nymphes that you can <mark5>heare</mark5><br>
Both of the rivers and the forrests <mark4>greene:</mark4><br>
And of the sea that neighbours to her neare, <br>
Al with gay girlands goodly wel <mark5>beseene.</mark5><br>
And let them also with them bring in <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
Another gay girland <br>
For my fayre love of lillyes and of <mark4>roses,</mark4><br>
Bound truelove wize with a blew silke riband. <br>
And let them make great store of bridale <mark3>poses,</mark3><br>
And let them eeke bring store of other <mark4>flowers</mark4><br>
To deck the bridale <mark3>bowers.</mark3><br>
And let the ground whereas her foot shall <mark4>tread,</mark4><br>
For feare the stones her tender foot should <mark4>wrong</mark4><br>
Be strewed with fragrant flowers all <mark3>along,</mark3><br>
And diapred lyke the discolored <mark4>mead.</mark4><br>
Which done, doe at her chamber dore <mark5>awayt,</mark5><br>
For she will waken <mark1>strayt,</mark1><br>
The whiles doe ye this song unto her <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
The woods shall to you answer and your Eccho <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
Ye Nymphes of Mulla which with carefull <mark3>heed,</mark3><br>
The silver scaly trouts doe tend full <mark4>well,</mark4><br>
And greedy pikes which use therein to <mark3>feed,</mark3><br>
(Those trouts and pikes all others doo excell) <br>
And ye likewise which keepe the rushy <mark3>lake,</mark3><br>
Where none doo fishes <mark3>take,</mark3><br>
Bynd up the locks the which hang scatterd <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
And in his waters which your mirror <mark3>make,</mark3><br>
Behold your faces as the christall <mark3>bright,</mark3><br>
That when you come whereas my love doth <mark3>lie,</mark3><br>
No blemish she may <mark3>spie.</mark3><br>
And eke ye lightfoot mayds which keepe the <mark3>deere,</mark3><br>
That on the hoary mountayne use to <mark1>towre,</mark1><br>
And the wylde wolves which seeke them to devoure, <br>
With your steele darts doo chace from comming <mark3>neer,</mark3><br>
Be also present <mark5>heere,</mark5><br>
To helpe to decke her and to help to <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
That all the woods may answer and your eccho <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
Wake, now my love, awake; for it is <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
The Rosy Morne long since left Tithones <mark4>bed,</mark4><br>
All ready to her silver coche to clyme, <br>
And Phoebus gins to shew his glorious <mark1>hed.</mark1><br>
Hark how the cheerefull birds do chaunt theyr laies <br>
And carroll of loves <mark4>praise.</mark4><br>
The merry Larke hir mattins sings <mark4>aloft,</mark4><br>
The thrush replyes, the Mavis descant <mark5>playes,</mark5><br>
The Ouzell shrills, the Ruddock warbles <mark3>soft,</mark3><br>
So goodly all agree with sweet <mark4>consent,</mark4><br>
To this dayes <mark5>merriment.</mark5><br>
Ah my deere love why doe ye sleepe thus <mark4>long,</mark4><br>
When meeter were that ye should now <mark1>awake,</mark1><br>
T'awayt the comming of your joyous <mark1>make,</mark1><br>
And hearken to the birds lovelearned <mark3>song,</mark3><br>
The deawy leaves <mark4>among.</mark4><br>
For they of joy and pleasance to you <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
That all the woods them answer and theyr eccho <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
My love is now awake out of her <mark5>dreames,</mark5><br>
And her fayre eyes like stars that dimmed were <br>
With darksome cloud, now shew theyr goodly beames <br>
More bright then Hesperus his head doth rere. <br>
Come now ye damzels, daughters of <mark1>delight,</mark1><br>
Helpe quickly her to <mark1>dight,</mark1><br>
But first come ye fayre houres which were <mark4>begot</mark4><br>
In Joves sweet paradice, of Day and <mark4>Night,</mark4><br>
Which doe the seasons of the yeare <mark4>allot,</mark4><br>
And al that ever in this world is <mark1>fayre</mark1><br>
Doe make and still <mark5>repayre.</mark5><br>
And ye three handmayds of the Cyprian <mark1>Queene,</mark1><br>
The which doe still adorne her beauties <mark4>pride,</mark4><br>
Helpe to addorne my beautifullest <mark1>bride:</mark1><br>
And as ye her array, still throw betweene <br>
Some graces to be <mark5>seene,</mark5><br>
And as ye use to Venus, to her <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
The whiles the woods shal answer and your eccho <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
Now is my love all ready forth to <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
Let all the virgins therefore well <mark1>awayt,</mark1><br>
And ye fresh boyes that tend upon her <mark4>groome</mark4><br>
Prepare your selves; for he is comming <mark1>strayt.</mark1><br>
Set all your things in seemely good aray <br>
Fit for so joyfull <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
The joyfulst day that ever sunne did <mark3>see.</mark3><br>
Faire Sun, shew forth thy favourable <mark3>ray,</mark3><br>
And let thy lifull heat not fervent <mark3>be</mark3><br>
For feare of burning her sunshyny <mark3>face,</mark3><br>
Her beauty to <mark3>disgrace.</mark3><br>
O fayrest Phoebus, father of the <mark4>Muse,</mark4><br>
If ever I did honour thee aright, <br>
Or sing the thing, that mote thy mind <mark1>delight,</mark1><br>
Doe not thy servants simple boone <mark3>refuse,</mark3><br>
But let this day let this one day be myne, <br>
Let all the rest be <mark4>thine.</mark4><br>
Then I thy soverayne prayses loud will <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
That all the woods shal answer and theyr eccho <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
Harke how the Minstrels gin to shrill <mark4>aloud</mark4><br>
Their merry Musick that resounds from <mark4>far,</mark4><br>
The pipe, the tabor, and the trembling Croud, <br>
That well agree withouten breach or <mark3>jar.</mark3><br>
But most of all the Damzels doe <mark5>delite,</mark5><br>
When they their tymbrels smyte, <br>
And thereunto doe daunce and carrol <mark4>sweet,</mark4><br>
That all the sences they doe ravish <mark4>quite,</mark4><br>
The whyles the boyes run up and downe the <mark4>street,</mark4><br>
Crying aloud with strong confused <mark4>noyce,</mark4><br>
As if it were one voyce. <br>
Hymen io Hymen, Hymen they do <mark4>shout,</mark4><br>
That even to the heavens theyr shouting <mark4>shrill</mark4><br>
Doth reach, and all the firmament doth <mark3>fill,</mark3><br>
To which the people standing all <mark3>about,</mark3><br>
As in approvance doe thereto <mark4>applaud</mark4><br>
And loud advaunce her <mark3>laud,</mark3><br>
And evermore they Hymen Hymen <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
That al the woods them answer and theyr eccho <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
Loe where she comes along with portly <mark4>pace</mark4><br>
Lyke Phoebe from her chamber of the <mark4>East,</mark4><br>
Arysing forth to run her mighty <mark3>race,</mark3><br>
Clad all in <mark4>white</mark4>, that seemes a virgin <mark4>best.</mark4><br>
So well it her beseemes that ye would weene <br>
Some angell she had <mark4>beene.</mark4><br>
Her long loose yellow locks lyke golden <mark4>wyre,</mark4><br>
Sprinckled with perle, and perling flowres a tweene, <br>
Doe lyke a golden mantle her attyre, <br>
And being crowned with a girland <mark1>greene,</mark1><br>
Seeme lyke some mayden <mark1>Queene.</mark1><br>
Her modest eyes abashed to <mark4>behold</mark4><br>
So many gazers, as on her do <mark4>stare,</mark4><br>
Upon the lowly ground affixed <mark4>are.</mark4><br>
Ne dare lift up her countenance too <mark3>bold,</mark3><br>
But blush to heare her prayses sung so <mark4>loud,</mark4><br>
So farre from being <mark3>proud.</mark3><br>
Nathlesse doe ye still loud her prayses <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
That all the woods may answer and your eccho <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
Tell me ye merchants daughters did ye <mark1>see</mark1><br>
So fayre a creature in your towne <mark4>before?</mark4><br>
So sweet, so lovely, and so mild as <mark3>she,</mark3><br>
Adornd with beautyes grace and vertues <mark3>store,</mark3><br>
Her goodly eyes lyke Saphyres shining <mark1>bright,</mark1><br>
Her forehead yvory <mark3>white,</mark3><br>
Her cheekes lyke apples which the sun hath rudded, <br>
Her lips lyke cherryes charming men to <mark3>byte,</mark3><br>
Her brest like to a bowle of creame uncrudded, <br>
Her paps lyke lyllies budded, <br>
Her snowie necke lyke to a marble <mark1>towre,</mark1><br>
And all her body like a pallace <mark1>fayre,</mark1><br>
Ascending uppe with many a stately <mark5>stayre,</mark5><br>
To honors seat and chastities sweet <mark5>bowre.</mark5><br>
Why stand ye still ye virgins in <mark4>amaze,</mark4><br>
Upon her so to <mark3>gaze,</mark3><br>
Whiles ye forget your former lay to <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
To which the woods did answer and your eccho <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
But if ye saw that which no eyes can <mark1>see,</mark1><br>
The inward beauty of her lively <mark5>spright,</mark5><br>
Garnisht with heavenly guifts of high <mark3>degree,</mark3><br>
Much more then would ye wonder at that <mark3>sight,</mark3><br>
And stand astonisht lyke to those which <mark4>red</mark4><br>
Medusaes mazeful <mark1>hed.</mark1><br>
There dwels sweet love and constant <mark4>chastity,</mark4><br>
Unspotted fayth and comely womenhed, <br>
Regard of honour and mild <mark4>modesty,</mark4><br>
There vertue raynes as Queene in royal <mark4>throne,</mark4><br>
And giveth lawes <mark3>alone.</mark3><br>
The which the base affections doe obay, <br>
And yeeld theyr services unto her <mark3>will,</mark3><br>
Ne thought of thing uncomely ever <mark3>may</mark3><br>
Thereto approch to tempt her mind to <mark3>ill.</mark3><br>
Had ye once seene these her celestial <mark5>threasures,</mark5><br>
And unrevealed <mark4>pleasures,</mark4><br>
Then would ye wonder and her prayses <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
That al the woods should answer and your eccho <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
Open the temple gates unto my <mark1>love,</mark1><br>
Open them wide that she may enter <mark4>in,</mark4><br>
And all the postes adorne as doth <mark5>behove,</mark5><br>
And all the pillours deck with girlands <mark1>trim,</mark1><br>
For to recyve this Saynt with honour <mark3>dew,</mark3><br>
That commeth in to <mark3>you.</mark3><br>
With trembling steps and humble <mark4>reverence,</mark4><br>
She commeth in, before th'almighties vew: <br>
Of her ye virgins learne <mark4>obedience,</mark4><br>
When so ye come into those holy <mark4>places,</mark4><br>
To humble your proud <mark3>faces;</mark3><br>
Bring her up to th'high altar that she <mark1>may,</mark1><br>
The sacred ceremonies there <mark3>partake,</mark3><br>
The which do endlesse matrimony <mark1>make,</mark1><br>
And let the roring Organs loudly <mark3>play</mark3><br>
The praises of the Lord in lively <mark4>notes,</mark4><br>
The whiles with hollow <mark5>throates</mark5><br>
The Choristers the joyous Antheme <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
That al the woods may answere and their eccho <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
Behold whiles she before the altar <mark4>stands</mark4><br>
Hearing the holy priest that to her <mark4>speakes</mark4><br>
And blesseth her with his two happy <mark3>hands,</mark3><br>
How the red roses flush up in her cheekes, <br>
And the pure snow with goodly vermill <mark5>stayne,</mark5><br>
Like crimsin dyde in <mark5>grayne,</mark5><br>
That even th'Angels which <mark4>continually,</mark4><br>
About the sacred Altare doe <mark1>remaine,</mark1><br>
Forget their service and about her <mark3>fly,</mark3><br>
Ofte peeping in her face that seemes more <mark1>fayre,</mark1><br>
The more they on it <mark1>stare.</mark1><br>
But her sad eyes still fastened on the <mark4>ground,</mark4><br>
Are governed with goodly <mark1>modesty,</mark1><br>
That suffers not one looke to glaunce <mark3>awry,</mark3><br>
Which may let in a little thought unsownd. <br>
Why blush ye love to give to me your <mark1>hand,</mark1><br>
The pledge of all our <mark3>band?</mark3><br>
Sing ye sweet Angels, Alleluya <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
That all the woods may answere and your eccho <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
Now al is done; bring home the bride againe, <br>
Bring home the triumph of our <mark4>victory,</mark4><br>
Bring home with you the glory of her gaine, <br>
With joyance bring her and with jollity. <br>
Never had man more joyfull day then <mark4>this,</mark4><br>
Whom heaven would heape with blis. <br>
Make feast therefore now all this live long <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
This day for ever to me holy <mark4>is,</mark4><br>
Poure out the wine without restraint or <mark3>stay,</mark3><br>
Poure not by cups, but by the belly <mark4>full,</mark4><br>
Poure out to all that wull, <br>
And sprinkle all the postes and wals with <mark4>wine,</mark4><br>
That they may sweat, and drunken be <mark5>withall.</mark5><br>
Crowne ye God Bacchus with a coronall, <br>
And Hymen also crowne with wreathes of <mark3>vine,</mark3><br>
And let the Graces daunce unto the <mark4>rest;</mark4><br>
For they can doo it <mark1>best:</mark1><br>
The whiles the maydens doe theyr carroll <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
To which the woods shal answer and theyr eccho <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
Ring ye the bels, ye yong men of the <mark4>towne,</mark4><br>
And leave your wonted labors for this <mark1>day:</mark1><br>
This day is holy; doe ye write it <mark3>downe,</mark3><br>
That ye for ever it remember <mark1>may.</mark1><br>
This day the sunne is in his chiefest <mark4>hight,</mark4><br>
With Barnaby the <mark1>bright,</mark1><br>
From whence declining daily by <mark4>degrees,</mark4><br>
He somewhat loseth of his heat and <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
When once the Crab behind his back he <mark3>sees.</mark3><br>
But for this time it ill ordained <mark4>was,</mark4><br>
To chose the longest day in all the yeare, <br>
And shortest night, when longest fitter weare: <br>
Yet never day so long, but late would <mark3>passe.</mark3><br>
Ring ye the bels, to make it weare <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
And bonefiers make all <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
And daunce about them, and about them <mark1>sing:</mark1><br>
That all the woods may answer, and your eccho <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
Ah when will this long weary day have <mark4>end,</mark4><br>
And lende me leave to come unto my <mark1>love?</mark1><br>
How slowly do the houres theyr numbers <mark3>spend?</mark3><br>
How slowly does sad Time his feathers <mark1>move?</mark1><br>
Hast thee O fayrest Planet to thy <mark4>home</mark4><br>
Within the Westerne fome: <br>
Thy tyred steedes long since have need of <mark1>rest.</mark1><br>
Long though it be, at last I see it gloome, <br>
And the bright evening star with golden creast <br>
Appeare out of the <mark1>East.</mark1><br>
Fayre childe of beauty, glorious lampe of <mark1>love</mark1><br>
That all the host of heaven in rankes doost <mark4>lead,</mark4><br>
And guydest lovers through the nightes <mark3>dread,</mark3><br>
How chearefully thou lookest from <mark3>above,</mark3><br>
And seemst to laugh atweene thy twinkling <mark1>light</mark1><br>
As joying in the <mark1>sight</mark1><br>
Of these glad many which for joy doe <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
That all the woods them answer and their echo <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
Now ceasse ye damsels your delights forepast; <br>
Enough is it, that all the day was <mark5>youres:</mark5><br>
Now day is doen, and night is nighing <mark4>fast:</mark4><br>
Now bring the Bryde into the brydall boures. <br>
Now night is come, now soone her <mark5>disaray,</mark5><br>
And in her bed her <mark3>lay;</mark3><br>
Lay her in lillies and in <mark4>violets,</mark4><br>
And silken courteins over her <mark3>display,</mark3><br>
And odourd sheetes, and Arras coverlets. <br>
Behold how goodly my faire love does <mark3>ly</mark3><br>
In proud <mark4>humility;</mark4><br>
Like unto Maia, when as Jove her <mark4>tooke,</mark4><br>
In Tempe, lying on the flowry <mark4>gras,</mark4><br>
Twixt sleepe and wake, after she weary <mark1>was,</mark1><br>
With bathing in the Acidalian <mark3>brooke.</mark3><br>
Now it is night, ye damsels may be gon, <br>
And leave my love <mark1>alone,</mark1><br>
And leave likewise your former lay to <mark1>sing:</mark1><br>
The woods no more shal answere, nor your echo <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
Now welcome night, thou night so long <mark4>expected,</mark4><br>
That long daies labour doest at last <mark3>defray,</mark3><br>
And all my cares, which cruell love <mark3>collected,</mark3><br>
Hast sumd in one, and cancelled for <mark3>aye:</mark3><br>
Spread thy broad wing over my love and <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
That no man may us <mark1>see,</mark1><br>
And in thy sable mantle us enwrap, <br>
From feare of perrill and foule horror <mark3>free.</mark3><br>
Let no false treason seeke us to <mark4>entrap,</mark4><br>
Nor any dread disquiet once <mark3>annoy</mark3><br>
The safety of our <mark3>joy:</mark3><br>
But let the night be calme and <mark5>quietsome,</mark5><br>
Without tempestuous storms or sad afray: <br>
Lyke as when Jove with fayre Alcmena <mark1>lay,</mark1><br>
When he begot the great Tirynthian <mark1>groome:</mark1><br>
Or lyke as when he with thy selfe did <mark1>lie,</mark1><br>
And begot <mark4>Majesty.</mark4><br>
And let the mayds and yongmen cease to <mark1>sing:</mark1><br>
Ne let the woods them answer, nor theyr eccho <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
Let no lamenting cryes, nor dolefull teares, <br>
Be heard all night within nor yet <mark4>without:</mark4><br>
Ne let false whispers, breeding hidden feares, <br>
Breake gentle sleepe with misconceived dout. <br>
Let no deluding dreames, nor dreadful <mark4>sights</mark4><br>
Make sudden sad <mark5>affrights;</mark5><br>
Ne let housefyres, nor lightnings helpelesse <mark4>harmes,</mark4><br>
Ne let the Pouke, nor other evill <mark5>sprights,</mark5><br>
Ne let mischivous witches with theyr <mark5>charmes,</mark5><br>
Ne let hob Goblins, names whose sence we see <mark4>not,</mark4><br>
Fray us with things that be <mark1>not.</mark1><br>
Let not the shriech Oule, nor the Storke be <mark4>heard:</mark4><br>
Nor the night Raven that still deadly yels, <br>
Nor damned ghosts cald up with mighty <mark5>spels,</mark5><br>
Nor griesly vultures make us once <mark5>affeard:</mark5><br>
Ne let th'unpleasant Quyre of Frogs still <mark5>croking</mark5><br>
Make us to wish theyr <mark4>choking.</mark4><br>
Let none of these theyr drery accents <mark1>sing;</mark1><br>
Ne let the woods them answer, nor theyr eccho <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
But let stil Silence trew night watches keepe, <br>
That sacred peace may in assurance <mark4>rayne,</mark4><br>
And tymely sleep, when it is tyme to <mark5>sleepe,</mark5><br>
May poure his limbs forth on your pleasant <mark5>playne,</mark5><br>
The whiles an hundred little winged <mark4>loves,</mark4><br>
Like divers fethered <mark3>doves,</mark3><br>
Shall fly and flutter round about your <mark1>bed,</mark1><br>
And in the secret darke, that none <mark5>reproves,</mark5><br>
Their prety stelthes shal worke, and snares shal <mark3>spread</mark3><br>
To filch away sweet snatches of <mark1>delight,</mark1><br>
Conceald through covert <mark1>night.</mark1><br>
Ye sonnes of Venus, play your sports at <mark1>will,</mark1><br>
For greedy pleasure, carelesse of your toyes, <br>
Thinks more upon her paradise of <mark5>joyes,</mark5><br>
Then what ye do, albe it good or <mark1>ill.</mark1><br>
All night therefore attend your merry <mark1>play,</mark1><br>
For it will soone be <mark1>day:</mark1><br>
Now none doth hinder you, that say or <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
Ne will the woods now answer, nor your Eccho <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
Who is the same, which at my window peepes? <br>
Or whose is that faire face, that shines so <mark1>bright,</mark1><br>
Is it not Cinthia, she that never <mark5>sleepes,</mark5><br>
But walkes about high heaven al the <mark1>night?</mark1><br>
O fayrest goddesse, do thou not <mark4>envy</mark4><br>
My love with me to <mark3>spy:</mark3><br>
For thou likewise didst love, though now unthought, <br>
And for a fleece of woll, which <mark5>privily,</mark5><br>
The Latmian shephard once unto thee <mark4>brought,</mark4><br>
His pleasures with thee <mark3>wrought.</mark3><br>
Therefore to us be favorable <mark3>now;</mark3><br>
And sith of wemens labours thou hast <mark5>charge,</mark5><br>
And generation goodly dost <mark3>enlarge,</mark3><br>
Encline thy will t'effect our wishfull <mark3>vow,</mark3><br>
And the chast wombe informe with timely <mark4>seed,</mark4><br>
That may our comfort <mark3>breed:</mark3><br>
Till which we cease our hopefull hap to <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
Ne let the woods us answere, nor our Eccho <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
And thou great Juno, which with awful <mark4>might</mark4><br>
The lawes of wedlock still dost <mark4>patronize,</mark4><br>
And the religion of the faith first <mark3>plight</mark3><br>
With sacred rites hast taught to solemnize: <br>
And eeke for comfort often called <mark4>art</mark4><br>
Of women in their <mark3>smart,</mark3><br>
Eternally bind thou this lovely <mark1>band,</mark1><br>
And all thy blessings unto us <mark3>impart.</mark3><br>
And thou glad Genius, in whose gentle <mark1>hand,</mark1><br>
The bridale bowre and geniall bed <mark1>remaine,</mark1><br>
Without blemish or <mark5>staine,</mark5><br>
And the sweet pleasures of theyr loves <mark1>delight</mark1><br>
With secret ayde doest succour and <mark3>supply,</mark3><br>
Till they bring forth the fruitfull <mark4>progeny,</mark4><br>
Send us the timely fruit of this same <mark1>night.</mark1><br>
And thou fayre Hebe, and thou Hymen <mark1>free,</mark1><br>
Grant that it may so <mark1>be.</mark1><br>
Til which we cease your further prayse to <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
Ne any woods shal answer, nor your Eccho <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
And ye high <mark4>heavens</mark4>, the temple of the <mark4>gods,</mark4><br>
In which a thousand torches flaming <mark1>bright</mark1><br>
Doe burne, that to us wretched earthly clods, <br>
In dreadful darknesse lend desired <mark1>light;</mark1><br>
And all ye powers which in the same <mark5>remayne,</mark5><br>
More then we men can <mark3>fayne,</mark3><br>
Poure out your blessing on us <mark5>plentiously,</mark5><br>
And happy influence upon us <mark3>raine,</mark3><br>
That we may raise a large <mark4>posterity,</mark4><br>
Which from the earth, which they may long <mark5>possesse,</mark5><br>
With lasting happinesse, <br>
Up to your haughty pallaces may <mark4>mount,</mark4><br>
And for the guerdon of theyr glorious <mark4>merit</mark4><br>
May heavenly tabernacles there <mark3>inherit,</mark3><br>
Of blessed Saints for to increase the <mark4>count.</mark4><br>
So let us rest, sweet love, in hope of <mark1>this,</mark1><br>
And cease till then our tymely joyes to <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
The woods no more us answer, nor our eccho <mark1>ring.</mark1><br>
<br>
Song made in lieu of many <mark4>ornaments,</mark4><br>
With which my love should duly have bene dect, <br>
Which cutting off through hasty <mark4>accidents,</mark4><br>
Ye would not stay your dew time to <mark4>expect,</mark4><br>
But promist both to recompens, <br>
Be unto her a goodly <mark4>ornament,</mark4><br>
And for short time an endlesse moniment. <br>
