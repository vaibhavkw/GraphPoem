Title : The Waning Moon <br>
Author : Percy Bysshe Shelley <br><br>

And like a dying lady, lean and <mark3>pale,</mark3><br>
Who totters forth, wrapp'd in a gauzy <mark3>veil,</mark3><br>
Out of her chamber, led by the <mark3>insane</mark3><br>
And feeble wanderings of her fading <mark3>brain,</mark3><br>
The moon arose up in the murky East, <br>
A white and shapeless mass.<br>
