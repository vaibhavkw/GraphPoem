Title : To Homer <br>
Author : John Keats <br><br>

Standing aloof in giant <mark4>ignorance,</mark4><br>
Of thee I hear and of the <mark4>Cyclades,</mark4><br>
As one who sits ashore and longs <mark4>perchance</mark4><br>
To visit dolphin-coral in deep <mark4>seas.</mark4><br>
So thou wast blind;--but then the veil was <mark3>rent,</mark3><br>
For Jove uncurtain'd Heaven to let thee <mark3>live,</mark3><br>
And Neptune made for thee a spumy <mark3>tent,</mark3><br>
And Pan made sing for thee his <mark3>forest-hive;</mark3><br>
Aye on the shores of darkness there is <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
And precipices show untrodden <mark3>green,</mark3><br>
There is a budding morrow in <mark4>midnight,</mark4><br>
There is a triple sight in blindness <mark3>keen;</mark3><br>
Such seeing hadst thou, as it once befel <br>
To Dian, Queen of Earth, and Heaven, and Hell. <br>
