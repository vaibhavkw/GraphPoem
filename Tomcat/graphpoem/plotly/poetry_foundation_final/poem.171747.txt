Title : Invocation to the Social Muse <br>
Author : Archibald MacLeish <br><br>

Senora, it is true the Greeks are <mark4>dead.</mark4><br>
<br>
It is true also that we here are <mark4>Americans:</mark4><br>
That we use the machines: that a sight of the god is <mark4>unusual:</mark4><br>
That more people have more thoughts: that there <mark3>are</mark3><br>
<br>
Progress and science and tractors and revolutions <mark4>and</mark4><br>
Marx and the wars more antiseptic and <mark4>murderous</mark4><br>
And music in every home: there is also <mark3>Hoover.</mark3><br>
<br>
Does the lady suggest we should write it out in The <mark4>Word?</mark4><br>
Does Madame recall our responsibilities? We <mark1>are</mark1><br>
Whores, Fraulein: poets, Fraulein, are persons of <br>
<br>
Known vocation following troops: they must sleep <mark4>with</mark4><br>
Stragglers from either prince and of both <mark4>views.</mark4><br>
The rules permit them to further the business of <mark3>neither.</mark3><br>
<br>
It is also strictly forbidden to mix in <mark4>maneuvers.</mark4><br>
Those that infringe are inflated with praise on the <mark4>plazas--</mark4><br>
Their bones are resultantly afterwards found under <mark4>newspapers.</mark4><br>
<br>
Preferring life with the sons to death with the <mark4>fathers,</mark4><br>
We also doubt on the record whether the <mark4>sons</mark4><br>
Will still be shouting around with the same huzzas-- <br>
<br>
For we hope Lady to live to lie with the <mark4>youngest.</mark4><br>
There are only a handful of things a man <mark4>likes,</mark4><br>
Generation to generation, hungry <mark3>or</mark3><br>
<br>
Well fed: the earth's one: <mark4>life's</mark4><br>
One: Mister Morgan is not <mark4>one.</mark4><br>
<br>
There is nothing worse for our trade than to be in <mark4>style.</mark4><br>
<br>
He that goes naked goes further at last than <mark3>another.</mark3><br>
Wrap the bard in a flag or a school and they'll jimmy <mark4>his</mark4><br>
Door down and be thick in his bed--for a <mark4>month:</mark4><br>
<br>
(Who recalls the address now of the Imagists?)   <br>
But the naked man has always his own nakedness.   <br>
People remember forever his live <mark4>limbs.</mark4><br>
<br>
They may drive him out of the camps but one will take <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
They may stop his tongue on his teeth with a rope's <mark4>argument--</mark4><br>
He will lie in a house and be warm when they are <mark4>shaking.</mark4><br>
<br>
Besides, Tovarishch, how to embrace an <mark4>army?</mark4><br>
How to take to one's chamber a million <mark4>souls?</mark4><br>
How to conceive in the name of a column of <mark4>marchers?</mark4><br>
<br>
The things of the poet are done to a man <mark4>alone</mark4><br>
As the things of love are done--or of death when he hears <mark4>the</mark4><br>
Step withdraw on the stair and the clock tick <mark4>only.</mark4><br>
<br>
Neither his class nor his kind nor his trade may come near <mark1>him</mark1><br>
There where he lies on his left arm and will die, <br>
Nor his class nor his kind nor his trade when the blood is <mark4>jeering</mark4><br>
<br>
And his knee's in the soft of the bed where his love <mark4>lies.</mark4><br>
<br>
I remind you, Barinya, the life of the poet is <mark4>hard--</mark4><br>
A hardy life with a boot as quick as a fiver: <br>
<br>
Is it just to demand of us also to bear <mark4>arms?</mark4><br>
