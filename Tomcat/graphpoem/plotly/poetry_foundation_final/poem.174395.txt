Title : Lines Written in the Bay of Lerici <br>
Author : Percy Bysshe Shelley <br><br>

She left me at the silent <mark3>time</mark3><br>
When the moon had ceas'd to <mark3>climb</mark3><br>
The azure path of Heaven's <mark3>steep,</mark3><br>
And like an albatross <mark3>asleep,</mark3><br>
Balanc'd on her wings of <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
Hover'd in the purple <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
Ere she sought her ocean <mark4>nest</mark4><br>
In the chambers of the <mark3>West.</mark3><br>
She left me, and I stay'd <mark3>alone</mark3><br>
Thinking over every <mark3>tone</mark3><br>
Which, though silent to the <mark3>ear,</mark3><br>
The enchanted heart could <mark3>hear,</mark3><br>
Like notes which die when born, but <mark3>still</mark3><br>
Haunt the echoes of the <mark3>hill;</mark3><br>
And feeling ever?oh, too <mark3>much!?</mark3><br>
The soft vibration of her <mark3>touch,</mark3><br>
As if her gentle hand, even <mark3>now,</mark3><br>
Lightly trembled on my <mark3>brow;</mark3><br>
And thus, although she absent <mark3>were,</mark3><br>
Memory gave me all of <mark3>her</mark3><br>
That even Fancy dares to <mark4>claim:</mark4><br>
Her presence had made weak and <mark3>tame</mark3><br>
All passions, and I lived <mark1>alone</mark1><br>
In the time which is our <mark3>own;</mark3><br>
The past and future were <mark4>forgot,</mark4><br>
As they had been, and would be, <mark3>not.</mark3><br>
But <mark4>soon</mark4>, the guardian angel <mark4>gone,</mark4><br>
The daemon reassum'd his <mark4>throne</mark4><br>
In my faint heart. I dare not <mark3>speak</mark3><br>
My thoughts, but thus disturb'd and <mark3>weak</mark3><br>
I sat and saw the vessels <mark3>glide</mark3><br>
Over the ocean bright and <mark3>wide,</mark3><br>
Like spirit-winged chariots <mark4>sent</mark4><br>
O'er some serenest <mark4>element</mark4><br>
For ministrations strange and <mark4>far,</mark4><br>
As if to some Elysian <mark3>star</mark3><br>
Sailed for drink to <mark4>medicine</mark4><br>
Such sweet and bitter pain as <mark4>mine.</mark4><br>
And the wind that wing'd their <mark4>flight</mark4><br>
From the land came fresh and <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
And the scent of winged <mark3>flowers,</mark3><br>
And the coolness of the <mark3>hours</mark3><br>
Of dew, and sweet warmth left by <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
Were scatter'd o'er the twinkling <mark3>bay.</mark3><br>
And the fisher with his <mark4>lamp</mark4><br>
And spear about the low rocks <mark3>damp</mark3><br>
Crept, and struck the fish which <mark3>came</mark3><br>
To worship the delusive <mark3>flame.</mark3><br>
Too happy they, whose pleasure <mark4>sought</mark4><br>
Extinguishes all sense and <mark3>thought</mark3><br>
Of the regret that pleasure <mark4>leaves,</mark4><br>
Destroying life alone, not peace!<br>
