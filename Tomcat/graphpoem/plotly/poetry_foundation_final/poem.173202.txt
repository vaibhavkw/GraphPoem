Title : Autumn <br>
Author : John Clare <br><br>

The thistledown's flying, though the winds are all <mark3>still,</mark3><br>
On the green grass now lying, now mounting the <mark3>hill,</mark3><br>
The spring from the fountain now boils like a <mark3>pot;</mark3><br>
Through stones past the counting it bubbles <mark3>red-hot.</mark3><br>
<br>
The ground parched and cracked is like overbaked <mark3>bread,</mark3><br>
The greensward all wracked is, bents dried up and <mark3>dead.</mark3><br>
The fallow fields glitter like water <mark4>indeed,</mark4><br>
And gossamers twitter, flung from weed unto <mark3>weed.</mark3><br>
<br>
Hill-tops like hot iron glitter bright in the <mark3>sun,</mark3><br>
And the rivers we're eying burn to gold as they <mark3>run;</mark3><br>
Burning hot is the ground, liquid gold is the <mark3>air;</mark3><br>
Whoever looks round sees Eternity <mark3>there.</mark3><br>
