Title : To Autumn <br>
Author : John Keats <br><br>

Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness, <br>
Close bosom-friend of the maturing <mark3>sun;</mark3><br>
ConspiringConspiring Working together; literally, to conspire is "to breathe together" (OED) with him how to load and <mark4>bless</mark4><br>
With fruit the vines that round the thatch-evesthatch-eves Thatch-eaves, the edge of thatched roofs <mark3>run;</mark3><br>
To bend with apples the moss'd <mark4>cottage-trees,</mark4><br>
And fill all fruit with ripeness to the <mark3>core;</mark3><br>
To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel <mark4>shells</mark4><br>
With a sweet kernel; to set budding <mark3>more,</mark3><br>
And still more, later flowers for the <mark4>bees,</mark4><br>
Until they think warm days will never <mark4>cease,</mark4><br>
For summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy <mark4>cells.</mark4><br>
<br>
Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy <mark3>store?</mark3><br>
Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may <mark3>find</mark3><br>
Thee sitting careless on a granary <mark3>floor,</mark3><br>
Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowingwinnowing Separating the wheat from the chaff, the heavy from the light <mark3>wind;</mark3><br>
Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound <mark3>asleep,</mark3><br>
Drows'd with the fume of poppies, while thy hookhook <mark4>Scythe</mark4><br>
Spares the next swath and all its twined <mark4>flowers:</mark4><br>
And sometimes like a gleanergleaner One who gathers the remaining food after the reaper has harvested the field thou dost <mark3>keep</mark3><br>
Steady thy ladenladen Loaded down head across a <mark3>brook;</mark3><br>
Or by a cyder-press, with patient <mark3>look,</mark3><br>
Thou watchest the last oozings hours by <mark3>hours.</mark3><br>
<br>
Where are the songs of spring? Ay, Where are they?Where are they? Rhetorical convention known as ubi sunt, often appearing in poems that meditate on the transitory nature of life and the inevitability of <mark4>death.</mark4><br>
Think not of them, thou hast thy music <mark3>too,--</mark3><br>
While barred clouds bloombloom "to colour with a soft warm tint or glow" (OED)  the soft-dying day, <br>
And touch the stubble-plainsstubble-plains Fields made up of stubble, the remaining stumps of grain left after reaping with rosy <mark3>hue;</mark3><br>
Then in a wailful choir the small gnats <mark4>mourn</mark4><br>
Among the river sallowssallows Willow trees, borne <mark3>aloft</mark3><br>
Or sinking as the light wind lives or <mark4>dies;</mark4><br>
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly <mark3>bourn;</mark3><br>
Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble <mark3>soft</mark3><br>
The red-breast whistles from a garden-croftgarden-croft A croft is a small enclosed <mark4>field;</mark4><br>
And gathering swallows twitter in the <mark3>skies.</mark3><br>
