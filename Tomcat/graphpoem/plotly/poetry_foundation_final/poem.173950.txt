Title : The Mower <br>
Author : Andrew Marvell <br><br>

Luxurious man, to bring his vice in <mark3>use,</mark3><br>
Did after him the world <mark3>seduce;</mark3><br>
And from the fields the flow'rs and plants <mark3>allure,</mark3><br>
Where nature was most plain and <mark3>pure.</mark3><br>
He first enclos'd within the garden's <mark4>square</mark4><br>
A dead and standing pool of <mark3>air;</mark3><br>
And a more luscious earth for them did <mark4>knead,</mark4><br>
Which stupefied them while it <mark4>fed.</mark4><br>
The pink grew then as double as his <mark4>mind;</mark4><br>
The nutriment did change the <mark3>kind.</mark3><br>
With strange perfumes he did the roses <mark3>taint,</mark3><br>
And flow'rs themselves were taught to <mark3>paint.</mark3><br>
The tulip, white, did for complexion <mark3>seek,</mark3><br>
And learn'd to interline its <mark3>cheek;</mark3><br>
Its onion root they then so high did <mark4>hold,</mark4><br>
That one was for a meadow <mark3>sold.</mark3><br>
Another world was search'd, through oceans <mark3>new,</mark3><br>
To find the Marvel of <mark3>Peru.</mark3><br>
And yet these rarities might be <mark4>allow'd,</mark4><br>
To man, that sov'reign thing and <mark4>proud;</mark4><br>
Had he not dealt between the bark and <mark3>tree,</mark3><br>
Forbidden mixtures there to <mark3>see.</mark3><br>
No plant now knew the stock from which it <mark3>came,</mark3><br>
He grafts upon the wild the <mark3>tame;</mark3><br>
That the uncertain and adult'rate <mark4>fruit</mark4><br>
Might put the palate in <mark3>dispute.</mark3><br>
His green seraglio has its eunuchs <mark3>too,</mark3><br>
Lest any tyrant him <mark3>out-do;</mark3><br>
And in the cherry he does nature <mark4>vex,</mark4><br>
To procreate without a <mark3>sex.</mark3><br>
'Tis all enforc'd, the fountain and the grot,<br>
While the sweet fields do lie <mark4>forgot;</mark4><br>
Where willing nature does to all <mark4>dispense</mark4><br>
A wild and fragrant <mark4>innocence;</mark4><br>
And fauns and fairies do the meadows <mark3>till,</mark3><br>
More by their presence than their <mark3>skill.</mark3><br>
Their statues polish'd by some ancient <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
May to adorn the gardens <mark3>stand;</mark3><br>
But howso'ere the figures do <mark4>excel,</mark4><br>
The gods themselves with us do <mark3>dwell.</mark3><br>
