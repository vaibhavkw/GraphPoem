Title : Ode on Melancholy <br>
Author : John Keats <br><br>

No, no, go not to Lethe, neither <mark4>twist</mark4><br>
Wolf's-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous <mark3>wine;</mark3><br>
Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be <mark4>kiss'd</mark4><br>
       By nightshade, ruby grape of Proserpine; <br>
Make not your rosary of <mark4>yew-berries,</mark4><br>
       Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be <br>
Your mournful Psyche, nor the downy <mark4>owl</mark4><br>
A partner in your sorrow's <mark4>mysteries;</mark4><br>
       For shade to shade will come too drowsily, <br>
And drown the wakeful anguish of the <mark4>soul.</mark4><br>
<br>
But when the melancholy fit shall <mark4>fall</mark4><br>
Sudden from heaven like a weeping <mark3>cloud,</mark3><br>
That fosters the droop-headed flowers <mark3>all,</mark3><br>
And hides the green hill in an April <mark3>shroud;</mark3><br>
Then glut thy sorrow on a morning <mark4>rose,</mark4><br>
Or on the rainbow of the salt <mark3>sand-wave,</mark3><br>
Or on the wealth of globed <mark4>peonies;</mark4><br>
Or if thy mistress some rich anger <mark4>shows,</mark4><br>
Emprison her soft hand, and let her <mark3>rave,</mark3><br>
And feed deep, deep upon her peerless <mark4>eyes.</mark4><br>
<br>
She dwells with Beauty--Beauty that must <mark3>die;</mark3><br>
And Joy, whose hand is ever at his <mark3>lips</mark3><br>
Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure <mark3>nigh,</mark3><br>
Turning to poison while the bee-mouth <mark3>sips:</mark3><br>
Ay, in the very temple of <mark4>Delight</mark4><br>
Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran <mark3>shrine,</mark3><br>
Though seen of none save him whose strenuous <mark3>tongue</mark3><br>
Can burst Joy's grape against his palate <mark3>fine;</mark3><br>
His soul shalt taste the sadness of her <mark3>might,</mark3><br>
And be among her cloudy trophies <mark3>hung.</mark3><br>
