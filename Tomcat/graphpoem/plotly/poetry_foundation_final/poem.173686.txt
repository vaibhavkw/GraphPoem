Title : Coquette et Froide <br>
Author : Julia Ward Howe <br><br>

What is thy thought of <mark1>me?</mark1><br>
What is thy <mark3>feeling?</mark3><br>
Lov'st thou the veil of <mark4>sense,</mark4><br>
Or its <mark3>revealing?</mark3><br>
<br>
Leav'st thou the maiden rose<br>
Drooping and <mark4>blushing,</mark4><br>
Or rend'st its bosom with<br>
Kissing and <mark3>crushing?</mark3><br>
<br>
I would be beautiful<br>
That thou should'st woo <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Gentle, delightsome, <mark4>but</mark4><br>
To draw thee to <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
<br>
Yet should thy longing eye<br>
Ever caress <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
And quickened Fantasy<br>
Only, possess <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
<br>
Thus thy heart's highest need<br>
Long would I <mark4>cherish,</mark4><br>
Lest its more trivial <mark4>wish</mark4><br>
Pall, and then <mark4>perish.</mark4><br>
<br>
Would that Love's fond <mark4>pursuit</mark4><br>
Were crowned <mark3>never,</mark3><br>
Or that his virgin <mark4>kiss</mark4><br>
Lasted for <mark3>ever!</mark3><br>
