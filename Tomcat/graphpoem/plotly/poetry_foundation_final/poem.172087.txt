Title : my dreams, my works, must wait till after hell <br>
Author : Gwendolyn Brooks <br><br>

I hold my honey and I store my <mark4>bread</mark4><br>
In little jars and cabinets of my <mark4>will.</mark4><br>
I label clearly, and each latch and <mark4>lid</mark4><br>
I bid, Be firm till I return from <mark4>hell.</mark4><br>
I am very hungry. I am <mark4>incomplete.</mark4><br>
And none can tell when I may dine <mark4>again.</mark4><br>
No man can give me any word but <mark4>Wait,</mark4><br>
The puny light. I keep eyes pointed <mark4>in;</mark4><br>
Hoping <mark4>that</mark4>, when the devil days of my <mark4>hurt</mark4><br>
Drag out to their last dregs and I <mark4>resume</mark4><br>
On such legs as are left me, in such <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
As I can manage, remember to go <mark4>home,</mark4><br>
My taste will not have turned <mark4>insensitive</mark4><br>
To honey and bread old purity could <mark4>love.</mark4><br>
