Title : Holy Sonnets: Thou hast made me, and shall thy work decay? <br>
Author : John Donne <br><br>

Thou hast made me, and shall thy work <mark3>decay?</mark3><br>
Repair me now, for now mine end doth <mark4>haste,</mark4><br>
I run to death, and death meets me as <mark4>fast,</mark4><br>
And all my pleasures are like yesterday; <br>
I dare not move my dim eyes any <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
Despair behind, and death before doth <mark3>cast</mark3><br>
Such terror, and my feebled flesh doth <mark4>waste</mark4><br>
By sin in it, which it towards hell doth <mark2>weigh.</mark2><br>
Only thou art above, and when towards <mark3>thee</mark3><br>
By thy leave I can look, I rise <mark3>again;</mark3><br>
But our old subtle foe so tempteth <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
That not one hour I can myself <mark3>sustain;</mark3><br>
Thy grace may wing me to prevent his <mark4>art,</mark4><br>
And thou like adamant draw mine iron <mark3>heart.</mark3><br>
