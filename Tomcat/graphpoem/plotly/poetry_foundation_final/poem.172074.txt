Title : In Praise of Pain <br>
Author : Heather McHugh <br><br>

A brilliance takes up residence in <mark3>flaws--</mark3><br>
a brilliance all the unchipped faces of <mark4>design</mark4><br>
refuse. The wine collects its <mark4>starlets</mark4><br>
at a lip's <mark4>fault</mark4>, sunlight where the <mark4>nicked</mark4><br>
glass angles, and affection where the <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
is least correctable, where arrows <mark3>of</mark3><br>
unquivered light are lodged, where <mark4>someone</mark4><br>
else's eyes have come to be concerned. <br>
<br>
For beauty's sake, assault and drive and <mark4>burn</mark4><br>
the devil from the simply perfect <mark4>sun.</mark4><br>
Demand a birthmark on the skin of <mark3>love,</mark3><br>
a tremble in the touch, in come a <mark3>cry,</mark3><br>
and let the silverware of nights be flecked,   <br>
the moon pocked to distribute more or <mark4>less</mark4><br>
indwelling alloys of its dim and <mark4>shine</mark4><br>
by nip and tuck, by chance's dance of <mark3>laws.</mark3><br>
<br>
The brightness drawn and quartered on a <mark4>sheet,</mark4><br>
the moment cracked upon a bed, will <mark4>last</mark4><br>
as if you soldered them with moon and <mark4>flux.</mark4><br>
And break the bottle of the eye to see <br>
what lights are spun of accident and <mark4>glass.</mark4><br>
