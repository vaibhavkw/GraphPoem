Title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 96 <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

You say, but with no touch of <mark3>scorn,</mark3><br>
Sweet-hearted, you, whose light-blue <mark3>eyes</mark3><br>
Are tender over drowning <mark3>flies,</mark3><br>
You tell me, doubt is <mark3>Devil-born.</mark3><br>
<br>
I know not: one indeed I <mark3>knew</mark3><br>
In many a subtle question <mark3>versed,</mark3><br>
Who touch'd a jarring lyre at <mark3>first,</mark3><br>
But ever strove to make it <mark3>true:</mark3><br>
<br>
Perplext in faith, but pure in <mark4>deeds,</mark4><br>
At last he beat his music <mark4>out.</mark4><br>
There lives more faith in honest <mark3>doubt,</mark3><br>
Believe me, than in half the <mark3>creeds.</mark3><br>
<br>
He fought his doubts and gather'd <mark3>strength,</mark3><br>
He would not make his judgment <mark3>blind,</mark3><br>
He faced the spectres of the <mark3>mind</mark3><br>
And laid them: thus he came at <mark3>length</mark3><br>
<br>
To find a stronger faith his <mark4>own;</mark4><br>
And Power was with him in the <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
Which makes the darkness and the <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
And dwells not in the light <mark3>alone,</mark3><br>
<br>
But in the darkness and the <mark4>cloud,</mark4><br>
As over Sinai's peaks of <mark4>old,</mark4><br>
While Israel made their gods of <mark3>gold,</mark3><br>
Altho' the trumpet blew so <mark4>loud.</mark4><br>
