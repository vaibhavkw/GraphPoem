Title : Inside <br>
Author : Heather McHugh <br><br>

In the field is a <mark1>house</mark1><br>
of wood. A window of the <mark1>house</mark1><br>
contains the <mark4>field.</mark4><br>
<br>
You can't see far <br>
with a sun in the sky,   <br>
with a living-room lamp <br>
<br>
at night. Locality is <mark4>all</mark4><br>
you light, and you, as <mark4>single</mark4><br>
as a bed. But there's <br>
<br>
no end to dark. The bed is in the clearing <br>
and the clearing's in the <mark4>wind</mark4>, the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
is a world among others. Now your cell-stars split. <br>
