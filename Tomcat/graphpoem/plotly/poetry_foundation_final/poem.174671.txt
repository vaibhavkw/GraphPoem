Title : Rule Britannia <br>
Author : James Thomson <br><br>

When Britain first, at heaven's <mark3>command,</mark3><br>
Arose from out the azure <mark3>main,</mark3><br>
This was the charter of the <mark3>land,</mark3><br>
And guardian angels sung this <mark3>strain--</mark3><br>
"Rule, Britannia, rule the <mark3>waves;</mark3><br>
Britons never will be <mark3>slaves."</mark3><br>
<br>
The nations, not so blest as <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
Must in their turns to tyrants <mark3>fall;</mark3><br>
While thou shalt flourish great and <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
The dread and envy of them <mark3>all.</mark3><br>
"Rule, Britannia, rule the <mark1>waves;</mark1><br>
Britons never will be <mark1>slaves."</mark1><br>
<br>
Still more majestic shalt thou <mark4>rise,</mark4><br>
More dreadful from each foreign <mark5>stroke;</mark5><br>
As the loud blast that tears the <mark3>skies</mark3><br>
Serves but to root thy native <mark3>oak.</mark3><br>
"Rule, Britannia, rule the <mark1>waves;</mark1><br>
Britons never will be <mark1>slaves."</mark1><br>
<br>
Thee haughty tyrants ne'er shall <mark3>tame;</mark3><br>
All their attempts to bend thee <mark4>down,</mark4><br>
Will but arouse thy generous <mark3>flame,</mark3><br>
But work their woe and thy <mark3>renown.</mark3><br>
"Rule, Britannia, rule the <mark1>waves;</mark1><br>
Britons never will be <mark1>slaves."</mark1><br>
<br>
To thee belongs the rural <mark4>reign;</mark4><br>
Thy cities shall with commerce <mark4>shine;</mark4><br>
All thine shall be the subject <mark1>main,</mark1><br>
And every shore it circles <mark4>thine.</mark4><br>
"Rule, Britannia, rule the <mark1>waves;</mark1><br>
Britons never will be <mark1>slaves."</mark1><br>
<br>
The Muses, still with freedom <mark4>found,</mark4><br>
Shall to thy happy coast <mark3>repair:</mark3><br>
Blest isle! with matchless beauty <mark3>crowned,</mark3><br>
And manly hearts to guard the <mark3>fair.</mark3><br>
"Rule, Britannia, rule the <mark1>waves;</mark1><br>
Britons never will be <mark1>slaves."</mark1><br>
