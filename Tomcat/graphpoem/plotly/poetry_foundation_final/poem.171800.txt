Title : The Beautiful Changes <br>
Author : Richard Wilbur <br><br>

One wading a Fall meadow finds on all <mark4>sides</mark4><br>
The Queen Anne's Lace lying like <mark4>lilies</mark4><br>
On water; it <mark4>glides</mark4><br>
So from the walker, it <mark4>turns</mark4><br>
Dry grass to a lake, as the slightest shade of you   <br>
Valleys my mind in fabulous blue Lucernes. <br>
<br>
The beautiful changes as a forest is <mark3>changed</mark3><br>
By a chameleon's tuning his skin to it;   <br>
As a mantis, <mark3>arranged</mark3><br>
On a green leaf, <mark4>grows</mark4><br>
Into it, makes the leaf leafier, and <mark4>proves</mark4><br>
Any greenness is deeper than anyone <mark4>knows.</mark4><br>
<br>
Your hands hold roses always in a way that <mark4>says</mark4><br>
They are not only <mark4>yours</mark4>, the beautiful <mark4>changes</mark4><br>
In such kind <mark4>ways,</mark4><br>
Wishing ever to <mark3>sunder</mark3><br>
Things and things' selves for a second finding, to <mark4>lose</mark4><br>
For a moment all that it touches back to <mark3>wonder.</mark3><br>
