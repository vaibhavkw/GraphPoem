Title : Romance <br>
Author : Claude McKay <br><br>

To clasp you now and feel your head <mark3>close-pressed,</mark3><br>
Scented and warm against my beating <mark3>breast;</mark3><br>
<br>
To whisper soft and quivering your <mark3>name,</mark3><br>
And drink the passion burning in your <mark3>frame;</mark3><br>
<br>
To lie at full length, taut, with cheek to <mark3>cheek,</mark3><br>
And tease your mouth with kisses till you <mark3>speak</mark3><br>
<br>
Love <mark1>words</mark1>, mad words, dream words, sweet senseless <mark1>words,</mark1><br>
Melodious like notes of mating <mark3>birds;</mark3><br>
<br>
To hear you ask if I shall love <mark4>always,</mark4><br>
And myself answer: Till the end of <mark4>days;</mark4><br>
<br>
To feel your easeful sigh of <mark4>happiness</mark4><br>
When on your trembling lips I murmur: <mark4>Yes;</mark4><br>
<br>
It is so sweet. We know it is not <mark3>true.</mark3><br>
What matters it? The night must shed her <mark3>dew.</mark3><br>
<br>
We know it is not true, but it is <mark4>sweet--</mark4><br>
The poem with this music is <mark3>complete.</mark3><br>
