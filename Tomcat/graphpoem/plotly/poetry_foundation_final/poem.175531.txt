Title : To The Dead in the Graveyard Underneath My Window <br>
Author : Adelaide Crapsey <br><br>

Written in A Moment of <mark4>Exasperation</mark4><br>
How can you lie so still? All day I <mark4>watch</mark4><br>
And never a blade of all the green sod <mark4>moves</mark4><br>
To show where restlessly you toss and <mark4>turn,</mark4><br>
And fling a desperate arm or draw up <mark4>knees</mark4><br>
Stiffened and aching from their long <mark4>disuse;</mark4><br>
I watch all night and not one ghost comes forth <br>
To take its freedom of the midnight <mark4>hour.</mark4><br>
Oh, have you no rebellion in your <mark4>bones?</mark4><br>
The very worms must scorn you where you <mark1>lie,</mark1><br>
A pallid mouldering acquiescent folk, <br>
Meek habitants of unresented <mark4>graves.</mark4><br>
Why are you there in your straight row on row <br>
Where I must ever see you from my <mark4>bed</mark4><br>
That in your mere dumb presence iterate <br>
The text so weary in my ears: "Lie <mark1>still</mark1><br>
And <mark1>rest</mark1>, be patient and lie still and <mark1>rest."</mark1><br>
I'll not be patient! I will not lie <mark1>still!</mark1><br>
There is a brown road runs between the <mark4>pines,</mark4><br>
And further on the purple woodlands <mark1>lie,</mark1><br>
And still beyond blue mountains lift and loom; <br>
And I would walk the road and I would be <br>
Deep in the wooded shade and I would <mark4>reach</mark4><br>
The windy mountain tops that touch the <mark4>clouds.</mark4><br>
My eyes may follow but my feet are <mark4>held.</mark4><br>
Recumbent as you others must I too <br>
Submit? Be mimic of your <mark5>movelessness</mark5><br>
With pillow and counterpane for stone and <mark4>sod?</mark4><br>
And if the many sayings of the <mark4>wise</mark4><br>
Teach of submission I will not <mark4>submit</mark4><br>
But with a spirit all <mark4>unreconciled</mark4><br>
Flash an unquenched defiance to the <mark4>stars.</mark4><br>
Better it is to walk, to run, to <mark4>dance,</mark4><br>
Better it is to laugh and leap and sing, <br>
To know the open skies of dawn and <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
To move untrammeled down the flaming <mark4>noon,</mark4><br>
And I will clamour it through weary <mark4>days</mark4><br>
Keeping the edge of deprivation <mark4>sharp,</mark4><br>
Nor with the pliant speaking on my <mark4>lips</mark4><br>
Of resignation, sister to <mark4>defeat.</mark4><br>
I'll not be patient. I will not lie <mark1>still.</mark1><br>
<br>
And in ironic quietude who <mark4>is</mark4><br>
The despot of our days and lord of <mark4>dust</mark4><br>
Needs but, scarce heeding, wait to <mark4>drop</mark4><br>
Grim casual comment on rebellion's <mark4>end;</mark4><br>
"Yes, yes . . Wilful and petulant but now <br>
As dead and quiet as the others <mark4>are."</mark4><br>
And this each body and ghost of you hath <mark4>heard</mark4><br>
That in your graves do therefore lie so <mark1>still.</mark1><br>
