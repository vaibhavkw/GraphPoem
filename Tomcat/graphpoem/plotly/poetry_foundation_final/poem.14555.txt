Title : The Hook<br>
Author : Theodore Weiss<br><br>

<br>
The students, lost in raucousness,   <br>
caught as by the elder Breughel's <mark3>eye,</mark3><br>
we sit in the college <mark4>store</mark4><br>
over sandwiches and coffee, <mark4>wondering.</mark4><br>
She answers eagerly: the place was <mark4>fine;</mark4><br>
sometimes the winds grew very <mark4>cold,</mark4><br>
the snows so deep and wide she <mark4>lost</mark4><br>
sight of people. Yes, she was <mark4>well</mark4><br>
satisfied with her work, <mark4>expected--</mark4><br>
while the quarry's owner was <mark3>away--</mark3><br>
to do another year of <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
She is hammering. I <mark4>hear</mark4><br>
<br>
the steady sound inside our <mark3>dry,</mark3><br>
<br>
noisy days. Sparks fly; the <mark4>mind,</mark4><br>
so taken, mighty for a <mark4>moment,</mark4><br>
becomes quarry and sculptor both,   <br>
something caught like love and <mark4>war</mark4><br>
in this golden mesh: and <mark4>daring</mark4><br>
caught that flings like sparks <mark4>girls</mark4><br>
and boys, flagrant cities <mark4>prompt</mark4><br>
to daring's will, love and <mark1>war</mark1><br>
its burly <mark4>seconds.</mark4><br>
I see again three kids we <mark4>passed,</mark4><br>
three kids lounging at the edge <br>
of a forsaken quarry like <mark4>something</mark4><br>
<br>
they had built; in its sleepy <mark4>pool</mark4><br>
<br>
they found the whiteness of their <mark4>bodies,</mark4><br>
the excitement like parian <mark4>marble.</mark4><br>
Such the waters we find <mark4>ourselves</mark4><br>
in. We sit in the college store <mark4>absorbed</mark4><br>
in food and talk. Eagerness seizes <mark4>us</mark4><br>
like love that leaves its best <mark4>sailors</mark4><br>
in the mighty waves, love the <mark4>word</mark4><br>
<br>
for hook whose catching, and the <mark4>struggle</mark4><br>
<br>
there, is one great musical <mark4>clash</mark4><br>
of minds--each wave a passion and a <mark1>mind--</mark1><br>
a <mark4>possessed</mark4>, tumultuous <mark4>monument</mark4><br>
that would be free. <br>
We strain <mark4>forward</mark4><br>
as to some fabulous story. Incandescence   <br>
springs from her, the hammer of <mark4>remembrance</mark4><br>
fresh, the young woman, bulky graceful <mark5>body,</mark5><br>
face shining, who sculptured all <mark4>winter</mark4><br>
alone near the source of her <mark1>rock,</mark1><br>
digging down into the difficult <mark1>rock:</mark1><br>
<br>
the young woman who lost a day <mark4>once,</mark4><br>
<br>
talked to her cat, and when the <mark4>mirror</mark4><br>
of her art became too clear, when <mark4>dreaming</mark4><br>
seemed too big for night alone, took <mark4>long</mark4><br>
walks back to people, back to <mark4>speech,</mark4><br>
and time: <br>
the woman, who at <mark4>last--</mark4><br>
"I do not use live models"--sculptured <mark4>fish--</mark4><br>
"I remember long lonely holidays at <mark4>shores</mark4><br>
<br>
when the spray alone defined green <mark4>shapes</mark4><br>
approaching"--has just seen (her <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
still gleam with the gleam of <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
blink like the making of <mark4>many</mark4><br>
a take) a great <mark4>catch.</mark4><br>
April, we <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
is the time for fish, for <mark4>reaching</mark4><br>
in its sea-like waftings <mark4>one</mark4><br>
of earth's original <mark4>conclusions</mark4><br>
like the leftover gill <mark4>slits</mark4><br>
the singing student told us <mark4>about</mark4><br>
in this very spot just two days ago . . . <br>
we are in the middle of a great <mark1>catch,</mark1><br>
there collected as from her <mark4>year-long</mark4><br>
<br>
lonely rock, the thrashing, <mark4>clean-</mark4><br>
<br>
scaled, clear-lit shad in the <mark4>net.</mark4><br>
