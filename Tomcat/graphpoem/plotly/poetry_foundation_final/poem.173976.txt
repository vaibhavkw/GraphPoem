Title : Modern Love: XXVI <br>
Author : George Meredith <br><br>

Love ere he <mark4>bleeds</mark4>, an eagle in high <mark4>skies,</mark4><br>
Has earth beneath his wings: from reddened <mark3>eve</mark3><br>
He views the rosy dawn. In vain they <mark3>weave</mark3><br>
The fatal web below while far he <mark3>flies.</mark3><br>
But when the arrow strikes him, there's a <mark5>change.</mark5><br>
He moves but in the track of his spent <mark3>pain,</mark3><br>
Whose red drops are the links of a harsh <mark3>chain,</mark3><br>
Binding him to the ground, with narrow <mark3>range.</mark3><br>
A subtle serpent then has Love <mark3>become.</mark3><br>
I had the eagle in my bosom erst:<br>
Henceforward with the serpent I am cursed.<br>
I can interpret where the mouth is <mark3>dumb.</mark3><br>
Speak, and I see the side-lie of a <mark3>truth.</mark3><br>
Perchance my heart may pardon you this <mark3>deed:</mark3><br>
But be no coward:?you that made Love <mark3>bleed,</mark3><br>
You must bear all the venom of his <mark3>tooth!</mark3><br>
