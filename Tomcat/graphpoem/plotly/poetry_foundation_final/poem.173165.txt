Title : The Hunting of the Snark <br>
Author : Lewis Carroll <br><br>

Fit the <mark4>First</mark4><br>
The <mark4>Landing</mark4><br>
<br>
"Just the place for a Snark!" the Bellman <mark3>cried,</mark3><br>
As he landed his crew with <mark3>care;</mark3><br>
Supporting each man on the top of the <mark3>tide</mark3><br>
By a finger entwined in his <mark3>hair.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Just the place for a Snark! I have said it <mark3>twice:</mark3><br>
That alone should encourage the <mark3>crew.</mark3><br>
Just the place for a Snark! I have said it <mark3>thrice:</mark3><br>
What I tell you three times is <mark3>true."</mark3><br>
<br>
The crew was complete: it included a <mark4>Boots--</mark4><br>
A maker of Bonnets and <mark3>Hoods--</mark3><br>
A Barrister, brought to arrange their <mark3>disputes--</mark3><br>
And a Broker, to value their <mark3>goods.</mark3><br>
<br>
A Billiard-marker, whose skill was <mark4>immense,</mark4><br>
Might perhaps have won more than his <mark3>share--</mark3><br>
But a Banker, engaged at enormous <mark3>expense,</mark3><br>
Had the whole of their cash in his <mark1>care.</mark1><br>
<br>
There was also a Beaver, that paced on the <mark3>deck,</mark3><br>
Or would sit making lace in the <mark3>bow:</mark3><br>
And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from <mark3>wreck,</mark3><br>
Though none of the sailors knew <mark3>how.</mark3><br>
<br>
There was one who was famed for the number of <mark4>things</mark4><br>
He forgot when he entered the <mark3>ship:</mark3><br>
His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and <mark3>rings,</mark3><br>
And the clothes he had bought for the <mark3>trip.</mark3><br>
<br>
He had forty-two boxes, all carefully <mark4>packed,</mark4><br>
With his name painted clearly on <mark3>each:</mark3><br>
<mark4>But</mark4>, since he omitted to mention the <mark3>fact,</mark3><br>
They were all left behind on the <mark3>beach.</mark3><br>
<br>
The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, <mark4>because</mark4><br>
He had seven coats on when he <mark3>came,</mark3><br>
With three pair of boots--but the worst of it <mark3>was,</mark3><br>
He had wholly forgotten his <mark3>name.</mark3><br>
<br>
He would answer to "Hi!" or to any loud <mark3>cry,</mark3><br>
Such as "Fry me!" or "Fritter my <mark3>wig!"</mark3><br>
To "What-you-may-call-um!" or <mark3>"What-was-his-name!"</mark3><br>
But especially <mark4>"Thing-um-a-jig!"</mark4><br>
<br>
While, for those who preferred a more forcible <mark4>word,</mark4><br>
He had different names from <mark4>these:</mark4><br>
His intimate friends called him <mark4>"Candle-ends,"</mark4><br>
And his enemies <mark4>"Toasted-cheese."</mark4><br>
<br>
"His form in ungainly--his intellect <mark3>small--"</mark3><br>
(So the Bellman would often <mark4>remark)</mark4><br>
"But his courage is perfect! And that, after <mark3>all,</mark3><br>
Is the thing that one needs with a <mark1>Snark."</mark1><br>
<br>
He would joke with haenas, returning their <mark3>stare</mark3><br>
With an impudent wag of the <mark4>head:</mark4><br>
And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a <mark3>bear,</mark3><br>
"Just to keep up its spirits," he <mark3>said.</mark3><br>
<br>
He came as a Baker: but owned, when too <mark4>late--</mark4><br>
And it drove the poor Bellman <mark4>half-mad--</mark4><br>
He could only bake Bride-cake--for which, I may <mark3>state,</mark3><br>
No materials were to be <mark3>had.</mark3><br>
<br>
The last of the crew needs especial <mark1>remark,</mark1><br>
   Though he looked an incredible dunce: <br>
He had just one idea--but, that one being <mark1>"Snark,"</mark1><br>
The good Bellman engaged him at <mark4>once.</mark4><br>
<br>
He came as a Butcher: but gravely <mark4>declared,</mark4><br>
When the ship had been sailing a <mark4>week,</mark4><br>
He could only kill Beavers. The Bellman looked <mark3>scared,</mark3><br>
And was almost too frightened to <mark3>speak:</mark3><br>
<br>
But at length he explained, in a tremulous <mark3>tone,</mark3><br>
There was only one Beaver on <mark4>board;</mark4><br>
And that was a tame one he had of his <mark3>own,</mark3><br>
Whose death would be deeply <mark3>deplored.</mark3><br>
<br>
The Beaver, who happened to hear the <mark1>remark,</mark1><br>
Protested, with tears in its <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
That not even the rapture of hunting the <mark1>Snark</mark1><br>
Could atone for that dismal <mark3>surprise!</mark3><br>
<br>
It strongly advised that the Butcher should <mark3>be</mark3><br>
Conveyed in a separate <mark1>ship:</mark1><br>
But the Bellman declared that would never <mark3>agree</mark3><br>
With the plans he had made for the <mark1>trip:</mark1><br>
<br>
Navigation was always a difficult <mark4>art,</mark4><br>
Though with only one ship and one <mark4>bell:</mark4><br>
And he feared he must really decline, for his <mark3>part,</mark3><br>
Undertaking another as <mark3>well.</mark3><br>
<br>
The Beaver's best course was, no doubt, to <mark4>procure</mark4><br>
A second-hand dagger-proof <mark4>coat--</mark4><br>
So the Baker advised it--and next, to <mark3>insure</mark3><br>
Its life in some Office of <mark3>note:</mark3><br>
<br>
This the Banker suggested, and offered for <mark4>hire</mark4><br>
(On moderate terms), or for <mark4>sale,</mark4><br>
Two excellent Policies, one Against <mark3>Fire,</mark3><br>
And one Against Damage From <mark3>Hail.</mark3><br>
<br>
Yet still, ever after that sorrowful <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
Whenever the Butcher was <mark3>by,</mark3><br>
The Beaver kept looking the opposite <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
And appeared unaccountably <mark3>shy.</mark3><br>
<br>
Fit the <mark4>Second</mark4><br>
The Bellman's <mark3>Speech</mark3><br>
<br>
The Bellman himself they all praised to the <mark3>skies--</mark3><br>
Such a carriage, such ease and such <mark4>grace!</mark4><br>
Such solemnity, too! One could see he was <mark3>wise,</mark3><br>
The moment one looked in his <mark3>face!</mark3><br>
<br>
He had bought a large map representing the <mark3>sea,</mark3><br>
Without the least vestige of <mark4>land:</mark4><br>
And the crew were much pleased when they found it to <mark1>be</mark1><br>
A map they could all <mark3>understand.</mark3><br>
<br>
"What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and <mark4>Equators,</mark4><br>
Tropics, <mark4>Zones</mark4>, and Meridian <mark4>Lines?"</mark4><br>
So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would <mark3>reply</mark3><br>
"They are merely conventional <mark3>signs!</mark3><br>
<br>
"Other maps are such <mark3>shapes</mark3>, with their islands and <mark4>capes!</mark4><br>
But we've got our brave Captain to <mark4>thank</mark4><br>
(So the crew would protest) "that he's bought us the <mark4>best--</mark4><br>
A perfect and absolute <mark3>blank!"</mark3><br>
<br>
This was charming, no <mark3>doubt</mark3>, but they shortly found <mark4>out</mark4><br>
That the Captain they trusted so <mark1>well</mark1><br>
Had only one notion for crossing the <mark4>ocean,</mark4><br>
And that was to tingle his <mark1>bell.</mark1><br>
<br>
He was thoughtful and grave--but the orders he <mark4>gave</mark4><br>
Were enough to bewilder a <mark1>crew.</mark1><br>
When he cried "Steer to starboard, but keep her head <mark5>larboard!"</mark5><br>
What on earth was the helmsman to <mark3>do?</mark3><br>
<br>
Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder <mark4>sometimes:</mark4><br>
A thing, as the Bellman <mark4>remarked,</mark4><br>
That frequently happens in tropical <mark3>climes,</mark3><br>
   When a vessel is, so to speak, "snarked." <br>
<br>
But the principal failing occurred in the <mark4>sailing,</mark4><br>
And the Bellman, perplexed and <mark4>distressed,</mark4><br>
Said he had hoped, at <mark3>least</mark3>, when the wind blew due <mark4>East,</mark4><br>
That the ship would not travel due <mark4>West!</mark4><br>
<br>
But the danger was past--they had landed at <mark4>last,</mark4><br>
With their boxes, portmanteaus, and <mark4>bags:</mark4><br>
Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the <mark3>view,</mark3><br>
Which consisted to chasms and <mark5>crags.</mark5><br>
<br>
The Bellman perceived that their spirits were <mark3>low,</mark3><br>
And repeated in musical <mark1>tone</mark1><br>
Some jokes he had kept for a season of <mark3>woe--</mark3><br>
But the crew would do nothing but <mark3>groan.</mark3><br>
<br>
He served out some grog with a liberal <mark3>hand,</mark3><br>
And bade them sit down on the <mark1>beach:</mark1><br>
And they could not but own that their Captain looked <mark3>grand,</mark3><br>
As he stood and delivered his <mark1>speech.</mark1><br>
<br>
"Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your <mark4>ears!"</mark4><br>
(They were all of them fond of <mark4>quotations:</mark4><br>
So they drank to his health, and they gave him three <mark4>cheers,</mark4><br>
While he served out additional <mark4>rations).</mark4><br>
<br>
"We have sailed many <mark4>months</mark4>, we have sailed many <mark4>weeks,</mark4><br>
(Four weeks to the month you may <mark4>mark),</mark4><br>
But never as yet ('tis your Captain who <mark3>speaks)</mark3><br>
Have we caught the least glimpse of a <mark1>Snark!</mark1><br>
<br>
"We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many <mark4>days,</mark4><br>
(Seven days to the week I <mark3>allow),</mark3><br>
But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly <mark3>gaze,</mark3><br>
We have never beheld till <mark3>now!</mark3><br>
<br>
"Come, listen, my <mark3>men</mark3>, while I tell you <mark4>again</mark4><br>
The five unmistakable <mark4>marks</mark4><br>
By which you may <mark3>know</mark3>, wheresoever you <mark3>go,</mark3><br>
The warranted genuine <mark5>Snarks.</mark5><br>
<br>
"Let us take them in order. The first is the <mark4>taste,</mark4><br>
Which is meagre and hollow, but <mark4>crisp:</mark4><br>
Like a coat that is rather too tight in the <mark3>waist,</mark3><br>
With a flavour of <mark3>Will-o'-the-wisp.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Its habit of getting up late you'll <mark1>agree</mark1><br>
That it carries too far, when I <mark3>say</mark3><br>
That it frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock <mark3>tea,</mark3><br>
And dines on the following <mark1>day.</mark1><br>
<br>
"The third is its slowness in taking a <mark4>jest.</mark4><br>
Should you happen to venture on <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
It will sigh like a thing that is deeply <mark1>distressed:</mark1><br>
And it always looks grave at a <mark3>pun.</mark3><br>
<br>
"The fourth is its fondness for <mark4>bathing-machines,</mark4><br>
Which it constantly carries <mark4>about,</mark4><br>
And believes that they add to the beauty of <mark3>scenes--</mark3><br>
A sentiment open to <mark3>doubt.</mark3><br>
<br>
"The fifth is ambition. It next will be <mark4>right</mark4><br>
To describe each particular <mark4>batch:</mark4><br>
Distinguishing those that have feathers, and <mark3>bite,</mark3><br>
From those that have whiskers, and <mark3>scratch.</mark3><br>
<br>
"For, although common Snarks do no manner of <mark4>harm,</mark4><br>
Yet, I feel it my duty to <mark1>say,</mark1><br>
Some are Boojums--" The Bellman broke off in <mark3>alarm,</mark3><br>
For the Baker had fainted <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
<br>
Fit the <mark4>Third</mark4><br>
The Baker's <mark4>Tale</mark4><br>
<br>
They roused him with muffins--they roused him with <mark4>ice--</mark4><br>
They roused him with mustard and <mark4>cress--</mark4><br>
They roused him with jam and judicious <mark4>advice--</mark4><br>
They set him conundrums to <mark4>guess.</mark4><br>
<br>
When at length he sat up and was able to <mark1>speak,</mark1><br>
His sad story he offered to <mark4>tell;</mark4><br>
And the Bellman cried "Silence! Not even a <mark3>shriek!"</mark3><br>
And excitedly tingled his <mark1>bell.</mark1><br>
<br>
There was silence supreme! Not a shriek, not a <mark4>scream,</mark4><br>
Scarcely even a howl or a <mark1>groan,</mark1><br>
As the man they called "Ho!" told his story of <mark1>woe</mark1><br>
In an antediluvian <mark1>tone.</mark1><br>
<br>
"My father and mother were honest, though <mark4>poor--"</mark4><br>
"Skip all that!" cried the Bellman in <mark4>haste.</mark4><br>
"If it once becomes dark, there's no chance of a <mark1>Snark--</mark1><br>
We have hardly a minute to <mark3>waste!"</mark3><br>
<br>
"I skip forty years," said the Baker, in <mark4>tears,</mark4><br>
"And proceed without further <mark1>remark</mark1><br>
To the day when you took me aboard of your <mark1>ship</mark1><br>
To help you in hunting the <mark1>Snark.</mark1><br>
<br>
"A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was <mark4>named)</mark4><br>
Remarked, when I bade him <mark3>farewell--"</mark3><br>
"Oh, skip your dear uncle!" the Bellman <mark3>exclaimed,</mark3><br>
As he angrily tingled his <mark1>bell.</mark1><br>
<br>
"He remarked to me <mark3>then,</mark3>, said that mildest of <mark4>men,</mark4><br>
"'If your Snark be a Snark, that is <mark1>right:</mark1><br>
Fetch it home by all means--you may serve it with <mark4>greens,</mark4><br>
And it's handy for striking a <mark3>light.</mark3><br>
<br>
"'You may seek it with thimbles--and seek it with <mark1>care;</mark1><br>
You may hunt it with forks and <mark4>hope;</mark4><br>
You may threaten its life with a <mark3>railway-share;</mark3><br>
You may charm it with smiles and <mark3>soap--'"</mark3><br>
<br>
("That's exactly the <mark4>method,</mark4>, the Bellman <mark4>bold</mark4><br>
In a hasty parenthesis <mark1>cried,</mark1><br>
"That's exactly the way I have always been <mark4>told</mark4><br>
That the capture of Snarks should be <mark4>tried!")</mark4><br>
<br>
"'But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
If your Snark be a Boojum! For <mark3>then</mark3><br>
You will softly and suddenly vanish <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
And never be met with <mark1>again!'</mark1><br>
<br>
"It is this, it is this that oppresses my <mark4>soul,</mark4><br>
When I think of my uncle's last <mark4>words:</mark4><br>
And my heart is like nothing so much as a <mark3>bowl</mark3><br>
   Brimming over with quivering curds! <br>
<br>
"It is this, it is this--" "We have had that <mark4>before!"</mark4><br>
The Bellman indignantly <mark1>said.</mark1><br>
And the Baker replied "Let me say it once <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
It is this, it is this that I <mark3>dread!</mark3><br>
<br>
"I engage with the Snark--every night after <mark3>dark--</mark3><br>
In a dreamy delirious <mark3>fight:</mark3><br>
I serve it with greens in those shadowy <mark1>scenes,</mark1><br>
And I use it for striking a <mark1>light:</mark1><br>
<br>
"But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
In a moment (of this I am <mark4>sure),</mark4><br>
I shall softly and suddenly vanish <mark1>away--</mark1><br>
And the notion I cannot <mark3>endure!"</mark3><br>
<br>
Fit the <mark4>Fourth</mark4><br>
The <mark4>Hunting</mark4><br>
<br>
The Bellman looked uffish, and wrinkled his <mark3>brow.</mark3><br>
"If only you'd spoken <mark1>before!</mark1><br>
It's excessively awkward to mention it <mark1>now,</mark1><br>
With the Snark, so to speak, at the <mark3>door!</mark3><br>
<br>
"We should all of us <mark3>grieve</mark3>, as you well may <mark4>believe,</mark4><br>
If you never were met with <mark1>again--</mark1><br>
But surely, my <mark3>man</mark3>, when the voyage <mark4>began,</mark4><br>
You might have suggested it <mark1>then?</mark1><br>
<br>
"It's excessively awkward to mention it <mark1>now--</mark1><br>
As I think I've already <mark1>remarked."</mark1><br>
And the man they called "Hi!" replied, with a <mark3>sigh,</mark3><br>
"I informed you the day we <mark3>embarked.</mark3><br>
<br>
"You may charge me with murder--or want of <mark4>sense--</mark4><br>
(We are all of us weak at <mark4>times):</mark4><br>
But the slightest approach to a false pretence <br>
Was never among my <mark3>crimes!</mark3><br>
<br>
"I said it in Hebrew--I said it in <mark4>Dutch--</mark4><br>
I said it in German and <mark4>Greek:</mark4><br>
But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me <mark3>much)</mark3><br>
That English is what you <mark1>speak!"</mark1><br>
<br>
"'Tis a pitiful tale," said the Bellman, whose <mark1>face</mark1><br>
Had grown longer at every <mark1>word:</mark1><br>
"But, now that you've stated the whole of your <mark3>case,</mark3><br>
More debate would be simply <mark3>absurd.</mark3><br>
<br>
"The rest of my speech" (he explained to his <mark1>men)</mark1><br>
"You shall hear when I've leisure to speak <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
But the Snark is at hand, let me tell you <mark1>again!</mark1><br>
'Tis your glorious duty to seek <mark1>it!</mark1><br>
<br>
"To seek it with thimbles, to seek it with <mark1>care;</mark1><br>
To pursue it with forks and <mark1>hope;</mark1><br>
To threaten its life with a <mark1>railway-share;</mark1><br>
To charm it with smiles and <mark1>soap!</mark1><br>
<br>
"For the Snark's a peculiar creature, that <mark4>won't</mark4><br>
Be caught in a commonplace <mark1>way.</mark1><br>
Do all that you know, and try all that you <mark3>don't:</mark3><br>
Not a chance must be wasted <mark3>to-day!</mark3><br>
<br>
"For England expects--I forbear to <mark4>proceed:</mark4><br>
'Tis a maxim tremendous, but <mark4>trite:</mark4><br>
And you'd best be unpacking the things that you <mark3>need</mark3><br>
To rig yourselves out for the <mark1>fight."</mark1><br>
<br>
Then the Banker endorsed a blank check (which he <mark4>crossed),</mark4><br>
And changed his loose silver for <mark4>notes.</mark4><br>
The Baker with care combed his whiskers and <mark1>hair,</mark1><br>
And shook the dust out of his <mark3>coats.</mark3><br>
<br>
The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a <mark4>spade--</mark4><br>
Each working the grindstone in <mark4>turn:</mark4><br>
But the Beaver went on making lace, and <mark3>displayed</mark3><br>
No interest in the <mark3>concern:</mark3><br>
<br>
Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its <mark4>pride,</mark4><br>
And vainly proceeded to <mark4>cite</mark4><br>
A number of <mark3>cases</mark3>, in which making <mark4>laces</mark4><br>
Had been proved an infringement of <mark1>right.</mark1><br>
<br>
The maker of Bonnets ferociously <mark4>planned</mark4><br>
A novel arrangement of <mark4>bows:</mark4><br>
While the Billiard-marker with quivering <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
Was chalking the tip of his <mark3>nose.</mark3><br>
<br>
But the Butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself <mark4>fine,</mark4><br>
With yellow kid gloves and a <mark3>ruff--</mark3><br>
Said he felt it exactly like going to <mark3>dine,</mark3><br>
Which the Bellman declared was all <mark3>"stuff."</mark3><br>
<br>
"Introduce me, now there's a good fellow," he <mark1>said,</mark1><br>
"If we happen to meet it <mark4>together!"</mark4><br>
And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
Said "That must depend on the <mark3>weather."</mark3><br>
<br>
The Beaver went simply galumphing <mark1>about,</mark1><br>
At seeing the Butcher so <mark1>shy:</mark1><br>
And even the Baker, though stupid and <mark3>stout,</mark3><br>
Made an effort to wink with one <mark3>eye.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Be a man!" said the Bellman in wrath, as he <mark4>heard</mark4><br>
The Butcher beginning to <mark3>sob.</mark3><br>
"Should we meet with a Jubjub, that desperate <mark3>bird,</mark3><br>
We shall need all our strength for the <mark3>job!"</mark3><br>
<br>
Fit the <mark4>Fifth</mark4><br>
The Beaver's <mark4>Lesson</mark4><br>
<br>
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with <mark1>care;</mark1><br>
They pursued it with forks and <mark1>hope;</mark1><br>
They threatened its life with a <mark1>railway-share;</mark1><br>
They charmed it with smiles and <mark1>soap.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious <mark4>plan</mark4><br>
For making a separate <mark4>sally;</mark4><br>
And had fixed on a spot unfrequented by <mark3>man,</mark3><br>
A dismal and desolate <mark3>valley.</mark3><br>
<br>
But the very same plan to the Beaver <mark3>occurred:</mark3><br>
It had chosen the very same <mark4>place:</mark4><br>
Yet neither <mark4>betrayed</mark4>, by a sign or a <mark1>word,</mark1><br>
The disgust that appeared in his <mark1>face.</mark1><br>
<br>
Each thought he was thinking of nothing but <mark1>"Snark"</mark1><br>
And the glorious work of the <mark1>day;</mark1><br>
And each tried to pretend that he did not <mark1>remark</mark1><br>
That the other was going that <mark1>way.</mark1><br>
<br>
But the valley grew narrow and narrower <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
And the evening got darker and <mark4>colder,</mark4><br>
Till (merely from nervousness, not from good <mark3>will)</mark3><br>
They marched along shoulder to <mark3>shoulder.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then a scream, shrill and <mark3>high</mark3>, rent the shuddering <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
And they knew that some danger was <mark4>near:</mark4><br>
The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its <mark4>tail,</mark4><br>
And even the Butcher felt <mark3>queer.</mark3><br>
<br>
He thought of his <mark4>childhood</mark4>, left far far <mark4>behind--</mark4><br>
That blissful and innocent <mark1>state--</mark1><br>
The sound so exactly recalled to his <mark3>mind</mark3><br>
A pencil that squeaks on a <mark3>slate!</mark3><br>
<br>
"'Tis the voice of the Jubjub!" he suddenly <mark1>cried.</mark1><br>
   (This man, that they used to call "Dunce.") <br>
"As the Bellman would tell you," he added with <mark1>pride,</mark1><br>
"I have uttered that sentiment <mark1>once.</mark1><br>
<br>
"'Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat; <br>
You will find I have told it you <mark1>twice.</mark1><br>
Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is <mark4>complete,</mark4><br>
If only I've stated it <mark1>thrice."</mark1><br>
<br>
The Beaver had counted with scrupulous <mark1>care,</mark1><br>
Attending to every <mark1>word:</mark1><br>
But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in <mark3>despair,</mark3><br>
When the third repetition <mark1>occurred.</mark1><br>
<br>
It felt that, in spite of all possible <mark4>pains,</mark4><br>
It had somehow contrived to lose <mark4>count,</mark4><br>
And the only thing now was to rack its poor <mark3>brains</mark3><br>
By reckoning up the <mark3>amount.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Two added to one--if that could but be <mark4>done,"</mark4><br>
It said, "with one's fingers and <mark4>thumbs!"</mark4><br>
Recollecting with tears how, in earlier <mark4>years,</mark4><br>
It had taken no pains with its <mark4>sums.</mark4><br>
<br>
"The thing can be done," said the Butcher, "I <mark4>think.</mark4><br>
The thing must be done, I am <mark1>sure.</mark1><br>
The thing shall be done! Bring me paper and <mark3>ink,</mark3><br>
The best there is time to <mark1>procure."</mark1><br>
<br>
The Beaver brought paper, portfolio, <mark4>pens,</mark4><br>
And ink in unfailing <mark4>supplies:</mark4><br>
While strange creepy creatures came out of their <mark4>dens,</mark4><br>
And watched them with wondering <mark1>eyes.</mark1><br>
<br>
So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them <mark4>not,</mark4><br>
As he wrote with a pen in each <mark1>hand,</mark1><br>
And explained all the while in a popular <mark4>style</mark4><br>
Which the Beaver could well <mark1>understand.</mark1><br>
<br>
"Taking Three as the subject to reason <mark1>about--</mark1><br>
A convenient number to <mark1>state--</mark1><br>
We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply <mark1>out</mark1><br>
By One Thousand diminished by <mark4>Eight.</mark4><br>
<br>
"The result we proceed to divide, as you <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
By Nine Hundred and Ninety and <mark3>Two:</mark3><br>
Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must <mark1>be</mark1><br>
Exactly and perfectly <mark1>true.</mark1><br>
<br>
"The method employed I would gladly <mark4>explain,</mark4><br>
While I have it so clear in my <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
If I had but the time and you had but the <mark3>brain--</mark3><br>
But much yet remains to be <mark1>said.</mark1><br>
<br>
"In one moment I've seen what has hitherto <mark4>been</mark4><br>
Enveloped in absolute <mark4>mystery,</mark4><br>
And without extra charge I will give you at <mark5>large</mark5><br>
A Lesson in Natural <mark3>History."</mark3><br>
<br>
In his genial way he proceeded to <mark1>say</mark1><br>
(Forgetting all laws of <mark4>propriety,</mark4><br>
And that giving <mark3>instruction</mark3>, without <mark4>introduction,</mark4><br>
Would have caused quite a thrill in <mark4>Society),</mark4><br>
<br>
"As to temper the Jubjub's a desperate <mark1>bird,</mark1><br>
Since it lives in perpetual <mark4>passion:</mark4><br>
Its taste in costume is entirely <mark1>absurd--</mark1><br>
It is ages ahead of the <mark3>fashion:</mark3><br>
<br>
"But it knows any friend it has met once <mark1>before:</mark1><br>
It never will look at a <mark4>bribe:</mark4><br>
And in charity-meetings it stands at the <mark1>door,</mark1><br>
And collects--though it does not <mark3>subscribe.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Its flavour when cooked is more exquisite <mark4>far</mark4><br>
Than mutton, or <mark4>oysters</mark4>, or <mark4>eggs:</mark4><br>
(Some think it keeps best in an ivory <mark3>jar,</mark3><br>
And some, in mahogany <mark3>kegs:)</mark3><br>
<br>
"You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in <mark3>glue:</mark3><br>
You condense it with locusts and <mark4>tape:</mark4><br>
Still keeping one principal object in <mark1>view--</mark1><br>
To preserve its symmetrical <mark3>shape."</mark3><br>
<br>
The Butcher would gladly have talked till next <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
But he felt that the Lesson must <mark4>end,</mark4><br>
And he wept with delight in attempting to <mark1>say</mark1><br>
He considered the Beaver his <mark3>friend.</mark3><br>
<br>
While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate <mark4>looks</mark4><br>
More eloquent even than <mark1>tears,</mark1><br>
It had learned in ten minutes far more than all <mark3>books</mark3><br>
Would have taught it in seventy <mark1>years.</mark1><br>
<br>
They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, <mark4>unmanned</mark4><br>
(For a moment) with noble <mark4>emotion,</mark4><br>
Said "This amply repays all the wearisome <mark1>days</mark1><br>
We have spent on the billowy <mark1>ocean!"</mark1><br>
<br>
Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher <mark4>became,</mark4><br>
Have seldom if ever been <mark4>known;</mark4><br>
In winter or summer, 'twas always the <mark3>same--</mark3><br>
You could never meet either <mark3>alone.</mark3><br>
<br>
And when quarrels arose--as one frequently <mark4>finds</mark4><br>
Quarrels will, spite of every <mark4>endeavour--</mark4><br>
The song of the Jubjub recurred to their <mark3>minds,</mark3><br>
And cemented their friendship for <mark3>ever!</mark3><br>
<br>
Fit the <mark4>Sixth</mark4><br>
The Barrister's <mark4>Dream</mark4><br>
<br>
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with <mark1>care;</mark1><br>
They pursued it with forks and <mark1>hope;</mark1><br>
They threatened its life with a <mark1>railway-share;</mark1><br>
They charmed it with smiles and <mark1>soap.</mark1><br>
<br>
But the Barrister, weary of proving in <mark4>vain</mark4><br>
That the Beaver's lace-making was <mark4>wrong,</mark4><br>
Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite <mark3>plain</mark3><br>
That his fancy had dwelt on so <mark3>long.</mark3><br>
<br>
He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy <mark4>Court,</mark4><br>
Where the Snark, with a glass in its <mark1>eye,</mark1><br>
Dressed in gown, bands, and <mark3>wig</mark3>, was defending a <mark3>pig</mark3><br>
On the charge of deserting its <mark3>sty.</mark3><br>
<br>
The Witnesses proved, without error or <mark3>flaw,</mark3><br>
That the sty was deserted when <mark4>found:</mark4><br>
And the Judge kept explaining the state of the <mark3>law</mark3><br>
In a soft under-current of <mark3>sound.</mark3><br>
<br>
The indictment had never been clearly <mark4>expressed,</mark4><br>
And it seemed that the Snark had <mark4>begun,</mark4><br>
And had spoken three hours, before any one <mark3>guessed</mark3><br>
What the pig was supposed to have <mark1>done.</mark1><br>
<br>
The Jury had each formed a different <mark1>view</mark1><br>
(Long before the indictment was <mark4>read),</mark4><br>
And they all spoke at once, so that none of them <mark3>knew</mark3><br>
One word that the others had <mark1>said.</mark1><br>
<br>
"You must know--" said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed <mark4>"Fudge!"</mark4><br>
That statute is obsolete <mark4>quite!</mark4><br>
Let me tell you, my <mark3>friends</mark3>, the whole question <mark4>depends</mark4><br>
On an ancient manorial <mark1>right.</mark1><br>
<br>
"In the matter of Treason the pig would <mark4>appear</mark4><br>
To have <mark4>aided</mark4>, but scarcely <mark4>abetted:</mark4><br>
While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is <mark3>clear,</mark3><br>
If you grant the plea 'never <mark3>indebted.'</mark3><br>
<br>
"The fact of Desertion I will not <mark4>dispute;</mark4><br>
But its guilt, as I trust, is <mark4>removed</mark4><br>
(So far as relates to the costs of this <mark3>suit)</mark3><br>
By the Alibi which has been <mark3>proved.</mark3><br>
<br>
"My poor client's fate now depends on your <mark4>votes."</mark4><br>
Here the speaker sat down in his <mark1>place,</mark1><br>
And directed the Judge to refer to his <mark1>notes</mark1><br>
And briefly to sum up the <mark1>case.</mark1><br>
<br>
But the Judge said he never had summed up <mark1>before;</mark1><br>
So the Snark undertook it <mark4>instead,</mark4><br>
And summed it so well that it came to far <mark1>more</mark1><br>
Than the Witnesses ever had <mark1>said!</mark1><br>
<br>
When the verdict was called for, the Jury <mark4>declined,</mark4><br>
As the word was so puzzling to <mark4>spell;</mark4><br>
But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn't <mark1>mind</mark1><br>
Undertaking that duty as <mark1>well.</mark1><br>
<br>
So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it <mark4>owned,</mark4><br>
It was spent with the toils of the <mark1>day:</mark1><br>
When it said the word "GUILTY!" the Jury all <mark3>groaned,</mark3><br>
And some of them fainted <mark1>away.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being <mark1>quite</mark1><br>
Too nervous to utter a <mark1>word:</mark1><br>
When it rose to its <mark4>feet</mark4>, there was silence like <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
And the fall of a pin might be <mark1>heard.</mark1><br>
<br>
"Transportation for life" was the sentence it <mark1>gave,</mark1><br>
"And then to be fined forty <mark4>pound."</mark4><br>
The Jury all <mark3>cheered</mark3>, though the Judge said he <mark4>feared</mark4><br>
That the phrase was not legally <mark1>sound.</mark1><br>
<br>
But their wild exultation was suddenly <mark4>checked</mark4><br>
When the jailer informed them, with <mark1>tears,</mark1><br>
Such a sentence would have not the slightest <mark3>effect,</mark3><br>
As the pig had been dead for some <mark1>years.</mark1><br>
<br>
The Judge left the Court, looking deeply <mark4>disgusted:</mark4><br>
But the Snark, though a little <mark4>aghast,</mark4><br>
As the lawyer to whom the defence was <mark5>intrusted,</mark5><br>
Went bellowing on to the <mark1>last.</mark1><br>
<br>
Thus the Barrister <mark3>dreamed</mark3>, while the bellowing <mark4>seemed</mark4><br>
To grow every moment more <mark1>clear:</mark1><br>
Till he woke to the knell of a furious <mark1>bell,</mark1><br>
Which the Bellman rang close at his <mark3>ear.</mark3><br>
<br>
Fit the <mark4>Seventh</mark4><br>
The Banker's <mark4>Fate</mark4><br>
<br>
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with <mark1>care;</mark1><br>
They pursued it with forks and <mark1>hope;</mark1><br>
They threatened its life with a <mark1>railway-share;</mark1><br>
They charmed it with smiles and <mark1>soap.</mark1><br>
<br>
And the Banker, inspired with a courage so <mark2>new</mark2><br>
It was matter for general <mark1>remark,</mark1><br>
Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their <mark1>view</mark1><br>
In his zeal to discover the <mark1>Snark</mark1><br>
<br>
But while he was seeking with thimbles and <mark1>care,</mark1><br>
A Bandersnatch swiftly drew <mark3>nigh</mark3><br>
And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in <mark1>despair,</mark1><br>
For he knew it was useless to <mark3>fly.</mark3><br>
<br>
He offered large discount--he offered a <mark4>cheque</mark4><br>
(Drawn "to bearer") for <mark4>seven-pounds-ten:</mark4><br>
But the Bandersnatch merely extended its <mark3>neck</mark3><br>
And grabbed at the Banker <mark1>again.</mark1><br>
<br>
Without rest or pause--while those frumious <mark4>jaws</mark4><br>
Went savagely snapping <mark4>around--</mark4><br>
He skipped and he <mark3>hopped</mark3>, and he floundered and <mark4>flopped,</mark4><br>
Till fainting he fell to the <mark3>ground.</mark3><br>
<br>
The Bandersnatch fled as the others <mark4>appeared</mark4><br>
Led on by that fear-stricken <mark3>yell:</mark3><br>
And the Bellman remarked "It is just as I <mark1>feared!"</mark1><br>
And solemnly tolled on his <mark1>bell.</mark1><br>
<br>
He was black in the <mark3>face</mark3>, and they scarcely could <mark3>trace</mark3><br>
The least likeness to what he had <mark1>been:</mark1><br>
While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned <mark4>white--</mark4><br>
A wonderful thing to be <mark4>seen!</mark4><br>
<br>
To the horror of all who were present that <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
He uprose in full evening <mark4>dress,</mark4><br>
And with senseless grimaces endeavoured to <mark1>say</mark1><br>
What his tongue could no longer <mark3>express.</mark3><br>
<br>
Down he sank in a chair--ran his hands through his <mark1>hair--</mark1><br>
And chanted in mimsiest <mark4>tones</mark4><br>
Words whose utter inanity proved his <mark4>insanity,</mark4><br>
While he rattled a couple of <mark3>bones.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Leave him here to his fate--it is getting so <mark1>late!"</mark1><br>
The Bellman exclaimed in a <mark4>fright.</mark4><br>
"We have lost half the <mark3>day</mark3>, Any further <mark3>delay,</mark3><br>
And we sha'n't catch a Snark before <mark1>night!"</mark1><br>
<br>
Fit the <mark4>Eighth</mark4><br>
The <mark4>Vanishing</mark4><br>
<br>
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with <mark1>care;</mark1><br>
They pursued it with forks and <mark1>hope;</mark1><br>
They threatened its life with a <mark1>railway-share;</mark1><br>
They charmed it with smiles and <mark1>soap.</mark1><br>
<br>
They shuddered to think that the chase might <mark4>fail,</mark4><br>
And the Beaver, excited at <mark1>last,</mark1><br>
Went bounding along on the tip of its <mark1>tail,</mark1><br>
For the daylight was nearly <mark3>past.</mark3><br>
<br>
"There is Thingumbob shouting!" the Bellman <mark1>said,</mark1><br>
"He is shouting like mad, only <mark4>hark!</mark4><br>
He is waving his hands, he is wagging his <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
He has certainly found a <mark1>Snark!"</mark1><br>
<br>
They gazed in delight, while the Butcher <mark1>exclaimed</mark1><br>
"He was always a desperate <mark4>wag!"</mark4><br>
They beheld him--their Baker--their hero <mark3>unnamed--</mark3><br>
On the top of a neighbouring <mark5>crag,</mark5><br>
<br>
Erect and <mark3>sublime</mark3>, for one moment of <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
In the next, that wild figure they <mark3>saw</mark3><br>
(As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a <mark4>chasm,</mark4><br>
While they waited and listened in <mark3>awe.</mark3><br>
<br>
"It's a Snark!" was the sound that first came to their <mark1>ears,</mark1><br>
And seemed almost too good to be <mark1>true.</mark1><br>
Then followed a torrent of laughter and <mark1>cheers:</mark1><br>
Then the ominous words "It's a <mark3>Boo--"</mark3><br>
<br>
Then, silence. Some fancied they heard in the <mark3>air</mark3><br>
A weary and wandering <mark1>sigh</mark1><br>
That sounded like "-jum!" but the others <mark3>declare</mark3><br>
It was only a breeze that went <mark1>by.</mark1><br>
<br>
They hunted till darkness came on, but they <mark1>found</mark1><br>
Not a button, or feather, or <mark1>mark,</mark1><br>
By which they could tell that they stood on the <mark1>ground</mark1><br>
Where the Baker had met with the <mark1>Snark.</mark1><br>
<br>
In the midst of the word he was trying to <mark1>say,</mark1><br>
In the midst of his laughter and <mark3>glee,</mark3><br>
He had softly and suddenly vanished <mark1>away--</mark1><br>
For the Snark was a Boojum, you <mark1>see.</mark1><br>
