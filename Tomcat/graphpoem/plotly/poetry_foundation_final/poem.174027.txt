Title : The Lover: A Ballad <br>
Author : Lady Mary Wortley Montagu <br><br>

At length, by so much importunity <mark4>press'd,</mark4><br>
Take, C----, at once, the inside of my <mark4>breast;</mark4><br>
This stupid indiff'rence so often you <mark3>blame,</mark3><br>
Is not owing to nature, to fear, or to <mark3>shame:</mark3><br>
I am not as cold as a virgin in <mark3>lead,</mark3><br>
Nor is Sunday's sermon so strong in my <mark3>head:</mark3><br>
I know but too well how time flies <mark4>along,</mark4><br>
That we live but few years, and yet fewer are <mark4>young.</mark4><br>
<br>
But I hate to be cheated, and never will buy<br>
Long years of repentance for moments of joy,<br>
Oh! was there a man (but where shall I <mark4>find</mark4><br>
Good sense and good nature so equally <mark4>join'd?)</mark4><br>
Would value his pleasure, contribute to <mark3>mine;</mark3><br>
Not meanly would boast, nor would lewdly <mark3>design;</mark3><br>
Not over severe, yet not stupidly <mark4>vain,</mark4><br>
For I would have the power, tho' not give the <mark3>pain.</mark3><br>
<br>
No pedant, yet learned; no rake-helly <mark3>gay,</mark3><br>
Or laughing, because he has nothing to <mark3>say;</mark3><br>
To all my whole sex obliging and <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
Yet never be fond of any but <mark3>me;</mark3><br>
In public preserve the decorum that's <mark4>just,</mark4><br>
And shew in his eyes he is true to his <mark3>trust;</mark3><br>
Then rarely approach, and respectfully <mark3>bow,</mark3><br>
But not fulsomely pert, nor yet foppishly <mark3>low.</mark3><br>
<br>
But when the long hours of public are <mark4>past,</mark4><br>
And we meet with champagne and a chicken at <mark3>last,</mark3><br>
May ev'ry fond pleasure that moment <mark4>endear;</mark4><br>
Be banish'd afar both discretion and <mark4>fear!</mark4><br>
Forgetting or scorning the airs of the <mark4>crowd,</mark4><br>
He may cease to be formal, and I to be <mark3>proud.</mark3><br>
Till lost in the joy, we confess that we <mark3>live,</mark3><br>
And he may be rude, and yet I may <mark3>forgive.</mark3><br>
<br>
And that my delight may be solidly <mark4>fix'd,</mark4><br>
Let the friend and the lover be handsomely <mark3>mix'd;</mark3><br>
In whose tender bosom my soul may <mark4>confide,</mark4><br>
Whose kindness can soothe me, whose counsel can <mark3>guide.</mark3><br>
From such a dear lover as here I <mark5>describe,</mark5><br>
No danger should fright me, no millions should <mark3>bribe;</mark3><br>
But till this astonishing creature I <mark3>know,</mark3><br>
As I long have liv'd chaste, I will keep myself <mark3>so.</mark3><br>
<br>
I never will share with the wanton coquette,<br>
Or be caught by a vain affectation of <mark4>wit.</mark4><br>
The toasters and songsters may try all their <mark4>art,</mark4><br>
But never shall enter the pass of my <mark3>heart.</mark3><br>
I loath the lewd rake, the dress'd fopling <mark4>despise:</mark4><br>
Before such pursuers the nice virgin <mark3>flies:</mark3><br>
And as Ovid has sweetly in parable <mark4>told,</mark4><br>
We harden like trees, and like rivers grow <mark3>cold.</mark3><br>
