Title : To His Coy Mistress <br>
Author : Andrew Marvell <br><br>

Had we but world enough and <mark3>time,</mark3><br>
This coyness, lady, were no <mark3>crime.</mark3><br>
We would sit down, and think which <mark3>way</mark3><br>
To walk, and pass our long love's <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
Thou by the Indian Ganges' <mark3>side</mark3><br>
Shouldst rubies <mark4>find</mark4>, I by the <mark3>tide</mark3><br>
Of Humber would complain. I <mark4>would</mark4><br>
Love you ten years before the <mark4>flood,</mark4><br>
And you should, if you <mark4>please</mark4>, <mark4>refuse</mark4><br>
Till the conversion of the <mark3>Jews.</mark3><br>
My vegetable love should <mark3>grow</mark3><br>
Vaster than empires and more <mark3>slow;</mark3><br>
An hundred years should go to <mark4>praise</mark4><br>
Thine <mark4>eyes</mark4>, and on thy forehead <mark3>gaze;</mark3><br>
Two hundred to adore each <mark3>breast,</mark3><br>
But thirty thousand to the <mark3>rest;</mark3><br>
An age at least to every <mark4>part,</mark4><br>
And the last age should show your <mark3>heart.</mark3><br>
For, lady, you deserve this <mark4>state,</mark4><br>
Nor would I love at lower <mark3>rate.</mark3><br>
But at my back I always <mark5>hear</mark5><br>
Time's winged chariot hurrying <mark4>near;</mark4><br>
And yonder all before us <mark3>lie</mark3><br>
Deserts of vast <mark4>eternity.</mark4><br>
Thy beauty shall no more be <mark4>found;</mark4><br>
Nor, in thy marble vault, shall <mark3>sound</mark3><br>
My echoing song; then worms shall <mark3>try</mark3><br>
That long-preserved <mark4>virginity,</mark4><br>
And your quaint honour turn to <mark4>dust,</mark4><br>
And into ashes all my <mark3>lust;</mark3><br>
The grave's a fine and private <mark3>place,</mark3><br>
But none, I think, do there <mark3>embrace.</mark3><br>
Now therefore, while the youthful <mark3>hue</mark3><br>
Sits on thy skin like morning <mark3>dew,</mark3><br>
And while thy willing soul <mark4>transpires</mark4><br>
At every pore with instant <mark3>fires,</mark3><br>
Now let us sport us while we <mark3>may,</mark3><br>
And now, like amorous birds of <mark3>prey,</mark3><br>
Rather at once our time <mark3>devour</mark3><br>
Than languish in his slow-chapped <mark3>power.</mark3><br>
Let us roll all our strength and <mark3>all</mark3><br>
Our sweetness up into one <mark3>ball,</mark3><br>
And tear our pleasures with rough <mark3>strife</mark3><br>
Through the iron gates of <mark3>life:</mark3><br>
Thus, though we cannot make our <mark3>sun</mark3><br>
Stand still, yet we will make him <mark3>run.</mark3><br>
