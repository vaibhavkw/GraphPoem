Title : The Deserted Village <br>
Author : Oliver Goldsmith <br><br>

Sweet <mark4>Auburn</mark4>, loveliest village of the <mark4>plain,</mark4><br>
Where health and plenty cheared the labouring <mark3>swain,</mark3><br>
Where smiling spring its earliest visit <mark3>paid,</mark3><br>
And parting summer's lingering blooms <mark3>delayed,</mark3><br>
Dear lovely bowers of innocence and <mark3>ease,</mark3><br>
Seats of my youth, when every sport could <mark3>please,</mark3><br>
How often have I loitered o'er thy <mark4>green,</mark4><br>
Where humble happiness endeared each <mark3>scene!</mark3><br>
How often have I paused on every <mark3>charm,</mark3><br>
The sheltered cot, the cultivated <mark3>farm,</mark3><br>
The never-failing brook, the busy <mark3>mill,</mark3><br>
The decent church that topt the neighbouring <mark3>hill,</mark3><br>
The hawthorn bush, with seats beneath the <mark3>shade,</mark3><br>
For talking age and whispering lovers <mark3>made!</mark3><br>
How often have I blest the coming <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
When toil remitting lent its turn to <mark3>play,</mark3><br>
And all the village train, from labour <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
Led up their sports beneath the spreading <mark3>tree,</mark3><br>
While many a pastime circled in the <mark1>shade,</mark1><br>
The young contending as the old <mark3>surveyed;</mark3><br>
And many a gambol frolicked o'er the <mark4>ground,</mark4><br>
And slights of art and feats of strength went <mark3>round;</mark3><br>
And still as each repeated pleasure <mark4>tired,</mark4><br>
Succeeding sports the mirthful band <mark3>inspired;</mark3><br>
The dancing pair that simply sought <mark4>renown</mark4><br>
By holding out to tire each other <mark3>down;</mark3><br>
The swain mistrustless of his smutted <mark3>face,</mark3><br>
While secret laughter tittered round the <mark3>place;</mark3><br>
The bashful virgin's side-long looks of <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
The matron's glance that would those looks <mark5>reprove!</mark5><br>
These were thy charms, sweet village; sports like <mark3>these,</mark3><br>
With sweet succession, taught even toil to <mark1>please;</mark1><br>
These round thy bowers their chearful influence <mark4>shed,</mark4><br>
These were thy charms--But all these charms are <mark3>fled.</mark3><br>
Sweet smiling village, loveliest of the <mark4>lawn,</mark4><br>
Thy sports are fled, and all thy charms <mark3>withdrawn;</mark3><br>
Amidst thy bowers the tyrant's hand is <mark4>seen,</mark4><br>
And desolation saddens all thy <mark1>green:</mark1><br>
One only master grasps the whole <mark4>domain,</mark4><br>
And half a tillage stints thy smiling <mark1>plain;</mark1><br>
No more thy glassy brook reflects the <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
But, choaked with sedges, works its weedy <mark3>way;</mark3><br>
Along thy glades, a solitary <mark3>guest,</mark3><br>
The hollow-sounding bittern guards its <mark3>nest;</mark3><br>
Amidst thy desert walks the lapwing <mark4>flies,</mark4><br>
And tires their echoes with unvaried <mark3>cries.</mark3><br>
Sunk are thy bowers, in shapeless ruin <mark4>all,</mark4><br>
And the long grass o'ertops the mouldering <mark3>wall;</mark3><br>
And, trembling, shrinking from the spoiler's <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
Far, far away, thy children leave the <mark3>land.</mark3><br>
Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a <mark3>prey,</mark3><br>
Where wealth accumulates, and men <mark3>decay:</mark3><br>
Princes and lords may flourish, or may <mark4>fade;</mark4><br>
A breath can make them, as a breath has <mark1>made;</mark1><br>
But a bold peasantry, their country's <mark4>pride,</mark4><br>
When once <mark4>destroyed</mark4>, can never be <mark3>supplied.</mark3><br>
A time there was, ere England's griefs <mark4>began,</mark4><br>
When every rood of ground maintained its <mark3>man;</mark3><br>
For him light labour spread her wholesome <mark3>store,</mark3><br>
Just gave what life required, but gave no <mark3>more:</mark3><br>
His best companions, innocence and <mark3>health;</mark3><br>
And his best riches, ignorance of <mark3>wealth.</mark3><br>
But times are altered; trade's unfeeling <mark4>train</mark4><br>
Usurp the land and dispossess the <mark1>swain;</mark1><br>
Along the lawn, where scattered hamlets <mark4>rose,</mark4><br>
Unwieldy wealth and cumbrous pomp <mark3>repose;</mark3><br>
And every want to oppulence <mark3>allied,</mark3><br>
And every pang that folly pays to <mark1>pride.</mark1><br>
Those gentle hours that plenty bade to <mark4>bloom,</mark4><br>
Those calm desires that asked but little <mark3>room,</mark3><br>
Those healthful sports that graced the peaceful <mark1>scene,</mark1><br>
Lived in each look, and brightened all the <mark1>green;</mark1><br>
These, far departing seek a kinder <mark3>shore,</mark3><br>
And rural mirth and manners are no <mark1>more.</mark1><br>
Sweet Auburn! parent of the blissful <mark4>hour,</mark4><br>
Thy glades forlorn confess the tyrant's <mark3>power.</mark3><br>
Here as I take my solitary <mark4>rounds,</mark4><br>
Amidst thy tangling walks, and ruined <mark3>grounds,</mark3><br>
And, many a year elapsed, return to <mark3>view</mark3><br>
Where once the cottage stood, the hawthorn <mark3>grew,</mark3><br>
Remembrance wakes with all her busy <mark1>train,</mark1><br>
Swells at my breast, and turns the past to <mark3>pain.</mark3><br>
In all my wanderings round this world of <mark4>care,</mark4><br>
In all my griefs--and God has given my <mark3>share--</mark3><br>
I still had hopes, my latest hours to <mark4>crown,</mark4><br>
Amidst these humble bowers to lay me <mark1>down;</mark1><br>
To husband out life's taper at the <mark4>close,</mark4><br>
And keep the flame from wasting by <mark1>repose.</mark1><br>
I still had hopes, for pride attends us <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
Amidst the swains to shew my book-learned <mark3>skill,</mark3><br>
Around my fire an evening groupe to <mark3>draw,</mark3><br>
And tell of all I felt, and all I <mark3>saw;</mark3><br>
And, as an hare whom hounds and horns <mark3>pursue,</mark3><br>
Pants to the place from whence at first she <mark3>flew,</mark3><br>
I still had hopes, my long vexations <mark4>past,</mark4><br>
Here to return--and die at home at <mark3>last.</mark3><br>
O blest retirement, friend to life's <mark4>decline,</mark4><br>
Retreats from care that never must be <mark3>mine,</mark3><br>
How happy he who <mark4>crowns</mark4>, in shades like <mark1>these</mark1><br>
A youth of labour with an age of <mark1>ease;</mark1><br>
Who quits a world where strong temptations <mark3>try,</mark3><br>
And, since 'tis hard to combat, learns to <mark3>fly!</mark3><br>
For him no wretches, born to work and <mark3>weep,</mark3><br>
Explore the mine, or tempt the dangerous <mark3>deep;</mark3><br>
No surly porter stands in guilty <mark4>state</mark4><br>
To spurn imploring famine from the <mark3>gate,</mark3><br>
But on he moves to meet his latter <mark4>end,</mark4><br>
Angels around befriending virtue's <mark3>friend;</mark3><br>
Bends to the grave with unperceived <mark1>decay,</mark1><br>
While resignation gently slopes the <mark1>way;</mark1><br>
And, all his prospects brightening to the <mark1>last,</mark1><br>
His Heaven commences ere the world be <mark1>past!</mark1><br>
Sweet was the sound, when oft at evening's <mark1>close,</mark1><br>
Up yonder hill the village murmur <mark1>rose;</mark1><br>
There, as I past with careless steps and <mark3>slow,</mark3><br>
The mingling notes came soften'd from <mark3>below;</mark3><br>
The swain responsive as the milk-maid <mark3>sung,</mark3><br>
The sober herd that lowed to meet their <mark3>young,</mark3><br>
The noisy geese that gabbled o'er the <mark4>pool,</mark4><br>
The playful children just let loose from <mark3>school,</mark3><br>
The watch-dog's voice that bayed the whispering <mark4>wind,</mark4><br>
And the loud laugh that spoke the vacant <mark3>mind,</mark3><br>
These all in sweet confusion sought the <mark1>shade,</mark1><br>
And filled each pause the nightingale had <mark1>made.</mark1><br>
But now the sounds of population <mark4>fail,</mark4><br>
No cheerful murmurs fluctuate in the <mark3>gale,</mark3><br>
No busy steps the grass-grown foot-way <mark4>tread,</mark4><br>
For all the bloomy flush of life is <mark1>fled.</mark1><br>
All but yon widowed, solitary <mark4>thing</mark4><br>
That feebly bends beside the plashy <mark3>spring;</mark3><br>
She, wretched matron, forced in age, for <mark3>bread,</mark3><br>
To strip the brook with mantling cresses <mark3>spread,</mark3><br>
To pick her wintry faggot from the <mark4>thorn,</mark4><br>
To seek her nightly shed, and weep till <mark3>morn;</mark3><br>
She only left of all the harmless <mark1>train,</mark1><br>
The sad historian of the pensive <mark1>plain.</mark1><br>
Near yonder copse, where once the garden <mark4>smiled,</mark4><br>
And still where many a garden-flower grows <mark3>wild;</mark3><br>
There, where a few torn shrubs the place <mark3>disclose,</mark3><br>
The village preacher's modest mansion <mark1>rose.</mark1><br>
A man he was, to all the country <mark4>dear,</mark4><br>
And passing rich with forty pounds a <mark3>year;</mark3><br>
Remote from towns he ran his godly <mark4>race,</mark4><br>
Nor e'er had changed, nor wished to change his <mark1>place;</mark1><br>
Unpractised he to fawn, or seek for <mark1>power,</mark1><br>
By doctrines fashioned to the varying <mark1>hour;</mark1><br>
Far other aims his heart had learned to <mark4>prize,</mark4><br>
More skilled to raise the wretched than to <mark3>rise.</mark3><br>
His house was known to all the vagrant <mark1>train,</mark1><br>
He chid their wanderings but relieved their <mark1>pain;</mark1><br>
The long-remembered beggar was his <mark1>guest,</mark1><br>
Whose beard descending swept his aged <mark3>breast;</mark3><br>
The ruined spendthrift, now no longer <mark4>proud,</mark4><br>
Claim'd kindred there, and had his claims <mark3>allowed;</mark3><br>
The broken soldier, kindly bade to <mark3>stay,</mark3><br>
Sate by his fire, and talked the night <mark3>away;</mark3><br>
Wept o'er his wounds, or, tales of sorrow <mark4>done,</mark4><br>
Shouldered his crutch, and shewed how fields were <mark3>won.</mark3><br>
Pleased with his guests, the good man learned to <mark3>glow,</mark3><br>
And quite forgot their vices in their <mark3>woe;</mark3><br>
Careless their merits, or their faults to <mark4>scan,</mark4><br>
His pity gave ere charity <mark1>began.</mark1><br>
Thus to relieve the wretched was his <mark1>pride,</mark1><br>
And even his failings leaned to Virtue's <mark3>side;</mark3><br>
But in his duty prompt at every <mark4>call,</mark4><br>
He watched and wept, he prayed and felt, for <mark1>all.</mark1><br>
And, as a bird each fond endearment <mark3>tries,</mark3><br>
To tempt its new-fledged offspring to the <mark3>skies;</mark3><br>
He tried each art, reproved each dull <mark3>delay,</mark3><br>
Allured to brighter worlds, and led the <mark1>way.</mark1><br>
   Beside the bed where parting life was layed,<br>
And sorrow, guilt, and pain, by turns, <mark4>dismayed</mark4><br>
The reverend champion stood. At his <mark4>control</mark4><br>
Despair and anguish fled the struggling <mark3>soul;</mark3><br>
Comfort came down the trembling wretch to <mark4>raise,</mark4><br>
And his last faltering accents whispered <mark3>praise.</mark3><br>
At church, with meek and unaffected <mark3>grace,</mark3><br>
His looks adorned the venerable <mark1>place;</mark1><br>
Truth from his lips prevailed with double <mark3>sway,</mark3><br>
And fools, who came to scoff, remained to <mark3>pray.</mark3><br>
The service past, around the pious <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
With steady zeal, each honest rustic <mark3>ran;</mark3><br>
Even children followed, with endearing <mark4>wile,</mark4><br>
And plucked his gown, to share the good man's <mark3>smile.</mark3><br>
His ready smile a parent's warmth exprest,<br>
Their welfare pleased him, and their cares <mark5>distrest:</mark5><br>
To them his heart, his love, his griefs were <mark4>given,</mark4><br>
But all his serious thoughts had rest in <mark4>Heaven.</mark4><br>
As some tall cliff that lifts its awful <mark4>form,</mark4><br>
Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the <mark3>storm,</mark3><br>
Tho' round its breast the rolling clouds are <mark1>spread,</mark1><br>
Eternal sunshine settles on its <mark3>head.</mark3><br>
Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the <mark1>way,</mark1><br>
With blossomed furze unprofitably <mark3>gay,</mark3><br>
There, in his noisy mansion, skill'd to <mark4>rule,</mark4><br>
The village master taught his little <mark1>school;</mark1><br>
A man severe he was, and stern to <mark1>view,</mark1><br>
I knew him well, and every truant <mark3>knew;</mark3><br>
Well had the boding tremblers learned to <mark3>trace</mark3><br>
The day's disasters in his morning <mark1>face;</mark1><br>
Full well they laughed, with counterfeited <mark3>glee,</mark3><br>
At all his jokes, for many a joke had <mark3>he:</mark3><br>
Full well the busy whisper circling <mark1>round,</mark1><br>
Conveyed the dismal tidings when he <mark3>frowned;</mark3><br>
Yet he was kind, or if severe in <mark4>aught,</mark4><br>
The love he bore to learning was in <mark4>fault;</mark4><br>
The village all declared how much he <mark1>knew;</mark1><br>
'Twas certain he could write, and cypher <mark3>too;</mark3><br>
Lands he could measure, terms and tides <mark5>presage,</mark5><br>
And ev'n the story ran that he could <mark4>gauge.</mark4><br>
In arguing too, the parson owned his <mark1>skill,</mark1><br>
For even tho' vanquished, he could argue <mark1>still;</mark1><br>
While words of learned length and thundering <mark3>sound,</mark3><br>
Amazed the gazing rustics ranged <mark3>around;</mark3><br>
And still they gazed, and still the wonder <mark1>grew,</mark1><br>
That one small head could carry all he <mark1>knew.</mark1><br>
But past is all his fame. The very <mark4>spot</mark4><br>
Where many a time he <mark4>triumphed</mark4>, is <mark3>forgot.</mark3><br>
Near yonder thorn, that lifts its head on <mark3>high,</mark3><br>
Where once the sign-post caught the passing <mark3>eye,</mark3><br>
Low lies that house where nut-brown draughts <mark1>inspired,</mark1><br>
Where grey-beard mirth and smiling toil <mark3>retired,</mark3><br>
Where village statesmen talked with looks <mark4>profound,</mark4><br>
And news much older than their ale went <mark1>round.</mark1><br>
Imagination fondly stoops to <mark1>trace</mark1><br>
The parlour splendours of that festive <mark1>place;</mark1><br>
The white-washed wall, the nicely sanded <mark4>floor,</mark4><br>
The varnished clock that clicked behind the <mark3>door;</mark3><br>
The chest contrived a double debt to <mark3>pay,</mark3><br>
A bed by night, a chest of drawers by <mark1>day;</mark1><br>
The pictures placed for ornament and <mark4>use,</mark4><br>
The twelve good rules, the royal game of <mark3>goose;</mark3><br>
The hearth, except when winter chill'd the <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
With aspen boughs, and flowers, and fennel <mark1>gay;</mark1><br>
While broken tea-cups, wisely kept for <mark3>shew,</mark3><br>
Ranged o'er the chimney, glistened in a <mark3>row.</mark3><br>
Vain transitory splendours! Could not <mark1>all</mark1><br>
Reprieve the tottering mansion from its <mark3>fall!</mark3><br>
Obscure it sinks, nor shall it more <mark4>impart</mark4><br>
An hour's importance to the poor man's <mark3>heart;</mark3><br>
Thither no more the peasant shall <mark4>repair</mark4><br>
To sweet oblivion of his daily <mark1>care;</mark1><br>
No more the farmer's news, the barber's <mark4>tale,</mark4><br>
No more the woodman's ballad shall <mark3>prevail;</mark3><br>
No more the smith his dusky brow shall <mark4>clear,</mark4><br>
Relax his ponderous strength, and lean to <mark4>hear;</mark4><br>
The host himself no longer shall be <mark3>found</mark3><br>
Careful to see the mantling bliss go <mark1>round;</mark1><br>
Nor the coy maid, half willing to be <mark4>prest,</mark4><br>
Shall kiss the cup to pass it to the <mark3>rest.</mark3><br>
Yes! let the rich deride, the proud <mark4>disdain,</mark4><br>
These simple blessings of the lowly <mark1>train;</mark1><br>
To me more dear, congenial to my <mark1>heart,</mark1><br>
One native charm, than all the gloss of <mark3>art;</mark3><br>
Spontaneous joys, where Nature has its <mark1>play,</mark1><br>
The soul adopts, and owns their first-born <mark1>sway;</mark1><br>
Lightly they frolic o'er the vacant <mark1>mind,</mark1><br>
Unenvied, <mark4>unmolested</mark4>, <mark3>unconfined.</mark3><br>
But the long pomp, the midnight <mark4>masquerade,</mark4><br>
With all the freaks of wanton wealth <mark3>arrayed,</mark3><br>
In these, ere triflers half their wish <mark3>obtain,</mark3><br>
The toiling pleasure sickens into <mark1>pain;</mark1><br>
And, even while fashion's brightest arts <mark5>decoy,</mark5><br>
The heart distrusting asks, if this be <mark3>joy.</mark3><br>
Ye friends to truth, ye statesmen who <mark3>survey</mark3><br>
The rich man's joys encrease, the poor's <mark1>decay,</mark1><br>
'Tis yours to judge, how wide the limits <mark4>stand</mark4><br>
Between a splendid and a happy <mark1>land.</mark1><br>
Proud swells the tide with loads of freighted <mark4>ore,</mark4><br>
And shouting Folly hails them from her <mark1>shore;</mark1><br>
Hoards even beyond the miser's wish <mark4>abound,</mark4><br>
And rich men flock from all the world <mark1>around.</mark1><br>
Yet count our gains. This wealth is but a <mark4>name</mark4><br>
That leaves our useful products still the <mark3>same.</mark3><br>
Not so the loss. The man of wealth and <mark1>pride</mark1><br>
Takes up a space that many poor <mark1>supplied;</mark1><br>
Space for his lake, his park's extended <mark4>bounds,</mark4><br>
Space for his horses, equipage, and <mark3>hounds:</mark3><br>
The robe that wraps his limbs in silken <mark4>sloth,</mark4><br>
Has robbed the neighbouring fields of half their <mark3>growth;</mark3><br>
His seat, where solitary sports are <mark1>seen,</mark1><br>
Indignant spurns the cottage from the <mark1>green:</mark1><br>
Around the world each needful product <mark1>flies,</mark1><br>
For all the luxuries the world <mark3>supplies.</mark3><br>
While thus the land adorned for pleasure, <mark1>all</mark1><br>
In barren splendour feebly waits the <mark1>fall.</mark1><br>
As some fair female unadorned and <mark1>plain,</mark1><br>
Secure to please while youth confirms her <mark3>reign,</mark3><br>
Slights every borrowed charm that dress <mark1>supplies,</mark1><br>
Nor shares with art the triumph of her <mark3>eyes.</mark3><br>
But when those charms are past, for charms are <mark4>frail,</mark4><br>
When time advances, and when lovers <mark1>fail,</mark1><br>
She then shines forth, solicitous to <mark4>bless,</mark4><br>
In all the glaring impotence of <mark3>dress.</mark3><br>
Thus fares the <mark4>land</mark4>, by luxury <mark4>betrayed:</mark4><br>
In nature's simplest charms at first <mark1>arrayed;</mark1><br>
But verging to decline, its splendours <mark1>rise,</mark1><br>
Its vistas strike, its palaces <mark5>surprize;</mark5><br>
While, scourged by famine from the smiling <mark1>land,</mark1><br>
The mournful peasant leads his humble <mark3>band;</mark3><br>
And while he sinks, without one arm to <mark4>save,</mark4><br>
The country blooms--a garden, and a <mark3>grave.</mark3><br>
Where then, ah where, shall poverty <mark4>reside,</mark4><br>
To scape the pressure of contiguous <mark1>pride?</mark1><br>
If to some common's fenceless limits <mark4>strayed,</mark4><br>
He drives his flock to pick the scanty <mark3>blade,</mark3><br>
Those fenceless fields the sons of wealth <mark4>divide,</mark4><br>
And ev'n the bare-worn common is <mark3>denied.</mark3><br>
If to the city sped--What waits him <mark4>there?</mark4><br>
To see profusion that he must not <mark1>share;</mark1><br>
To see ten thousand baneful arts <mark4>combined</mark4><br>
To pamper luxury, and thin <mark3>mankind;</mark3><br>
To see those joys the sons of pleasure <mark3>know,</mark3><br>
Extorted from his fellow-creature's <mark1>woe.</mark1><br>
Here while the courtier glitters in <mark4>brocade,</mark4><br>
There the pale artist plies the sickly <mark3>trade;</mark3><br>
Here while the proud their long-drawn pomps <mark3>display,</mark3><br>
There the black gibbet glooms beside the <mark1>way.</mark1><br>
The dome where Pleasure holds her midnight <mark1>reign,</mark1><br>
Here, richly deckt, admits the gorgeous <mark1>train;</mark1><br>
Tumultuous grandeur crowds the blazing <mark3>square,</mark3><br>
The rattling chariots clash, the torches <mark3>glare.</mark3><br>
Sure scenes like these no troubles e'er <mark3>annoy!</mark3><br>
Sure these denote one universal <mark1>joy!</mark1><br>
Are these thy serious thoughts?--Ah, turn thine <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
Where the poor houseless shivering female <mark3>lies.</mark3><br>
She once, perhaps, in village plenty <mark4>blest,</mark4><br>
Has wept at tales of innocence <mark1>distrest;</mark1><br>
Her modest looks the cottage might <mark4>adorn</mark4><br>
Sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the <mark1>thorn:</mark1><br>
Now lost to all; her friends, her virtue <mark1>fled,</mark1><br>
Near her betrayer's door she lays her <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
And, pinch'd with cold, and shrinking from the <mark3>shower,</mark3><br>
With heavy heart deplores that luckless <mark1>hour</mark1><br>
When idly first, ambitious of the <mark4>town,</mark4><br>
She left her wheel and robes of country <mark3>brown.</mark3><br>
Do <mark4>thine</mark4>, sweet Auburn, thine, the loveliest <mark1>train,</mark1><br>
Do thy fair tribes participate her <mark1>pain?</mark1><br>
Even now, perhaps, by cold and hunger <mark3>led,</mark3><br>
At proud men's doors they ask a little <mark1>bread!</mark1><br>
Ah, no. To distant climes, a dreary <mark1>scene,</mark1><br>
Where half the convex world intrudes <mark3>between,</mark3><br>
Through torrid tracts with fainting steps they <mark3>go,</mark3><br>
Where wild Altama murmurs to their <mark1>woe.</mark1><br>
Far different there from all that charm'd <mark4>before,</mark4><br>
The various terrors of that horrid <mark1>shore;</mark1><br>
Those blazing suns that dart a downward <mark3>ray,</mark3><br>
And fiercely shed intolerable <mark1>day;</mark1><br>
Those matted woods where birds forget to <mark3>sing,</mark3><br>
But silent bats in drowsy clusters <mark3>cling;</mark3><br>
Those poisonous fields with rank luxuriance <mark4>crowned,</mark4><br>
Where the dark scorpion gathers death <mark1>around;</mark1><br>
Where at each step the stranger fears to <mark3>wake</mark3><br>
The rattling terrors of the vengeful <mark3>snake;</mark3><br>
Where crouching tigers wait their hapless <mark1>prey,</mark1><br>
And savage men, more murderous still than <mark3>they;</mark3><br>
While oft in whirls the mad tornado <mark1>flies,</mark1><br>
Mingling the ravaged landscape with the <mark1>skies.</mark1><br>
Far different these from every former <mark1>scene,</mark1><br>
The cooling brook, the grassy vested <mark1>green,</mark1><br>
The breezy covert of the warbling <mark4>grove,</mark4><br>
That only shelter'd thefts of harmless <mark1>love.</mark1><br>
Good Heaven! what sorrows gloom'd that parting <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
That called them from their native walks <mark1>away;</mark1><br>
When the poor exiles, every pleasure <mark1>past,</mark1><br>
Hung round their bowers, and fondly looked their <mark1>last,</mark1><br>
And took a long farewell, and wished in <mark4>vain</mark4><br>
For seats like these beyond the western <mark3>main;</mark3><br>
And shuddering still to face the distant <mark1>deep,</mark1><br>
Returned and wept, and still returned to <mark1>weep.</mark1><br>
The good old sire the first prepared to <mark1>go</mark1><br>
To new found worlds, and wept for others <mark1>woe.</mark1><br>
But for himself, in conscious virtue <mark4>brave,</mark4><br>
He only wished for worlds beyond the <mark1>grave.</mark1><br>
His lovely daughter, lovelier in her <mark4>tears,</mark4><br>
The fond companion of his helpless <mark3>years,</mark3><br>
Silent went next, neglectful of her <mark4>charms,</mark4><br>
And left a lover's for a father's <mark3>arms.</mark3><br>
With louder plaints the mother spoke her <mark4>woes,</mark4><br>
And blessed the cot where every pleasure <mark1>rose;</mark1><br>
And kist her thoughtless babes with many a <mark4>tear,</mark4><br>
And claspt them close, in sorrow doubly <mark1>dear;</mark1><br>
Whilst her fond husband strove to lend <mark3>relief</mark3><br>
In all the silent manliness of <mark3>grief.</mark3><br>
O luxury! thou curst by Heaven's <mark3>decree,</mark3><br>
How ill exchanged are things like these for <mark3>thee!</mark3><br>
How do thy potions, with insidious <mark1>joy,</mark1><br>
Diffuse their pleasures only to <mark3>destroy!</mark3><br>
Kingdoms, by thee, to sickly greatness <mark4>grown,</mark4><br>
Boast of a florid vigour not their <mark3>own;</mark3><br>
At every draught more large and large they <mark3>grow,</mark3><br>
A bloated mass of rank unwieldy <mark1>woe;</mark1><br>
Till sapped their strength, and every part <mark3>unsound,</mark3><br>
Down, down they sink, and spread a ruin <mark1>round.</mark1><br>
Even now the devastation is <mark4>begun,</mark4><br>
And half the business of destruction <mark1>done;</mark1><br>
Even now, methinks, as pondering here I <mark1>stand,</mark1><br>
I see the rural virtues leave the <mark1>land:</mark1><br>
Down where yon anchoring vessel spreads the <mark3>sail,</mark3><br>
That idly waiting flaps with every <mark1>gale,</mark1><br>
Downward they move, a melancholy <mark1>band,</mark1><br>
Pass from the shore, and darken all the <mark3>strand.</mark3><br>
Contented toil, and hospitable <mark1>care,</mark1><br>
And kind connubial tenderness, are <mark1>there;</mark1><br>
And piety with wishes placed <mark4>above,</mark4><br>
And steady loyalty, and faithful <mark1>love.</mark1><br>
And thou, sweet Poetry, thou loveliest <mark4>maid,</mark4><br>
Still first to fly where sensual joys <mark3>invade;</mark3><br>
Unfit in these degenerate times of <mark3>shame,</mark3><br>
To catch the heart, or strike for honest <mark3>fame;</mark3><br>
Dear charming nymph, neglected and <mark4>decried,</mark4><br>
My shame in crowds, my solitary <mark1>pride;</mark1><br>
Thou source of all my bliss, and all my <mark1>woe,</mark1><br>
That found'st me poor at first, and keep'st me <mark3>so;</mark3><br>
Thou guide by which the nobler arts excell,<br>
Thou nurse of every virtue, fare thee <mark4>well!</mark4><br>
Farewell, and O where'er thy voice be <mark3>tried,</mark3><br>
On Torno's cliffs, or Pambamarca's <mark1>side,</mark1><br>
Whether were equinoctial fervours <mark1>glow,</mark1><br>
Or winter wraps the polar world in <mark3>snow,</mark3><br>
Still let thy voice, prevailing over <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
Redress the rigours of the inclement <mark5>clime;</mark5><br>
Aid slighted truth with thy persuasive <mark4>strain,</mark4><br>
Teach erring man to spurn the rage of <mark3>gain;</mark3><br>
Teach him, that states of native strength possest,<br>
Tho' very poor, may still be very <mark1>blest;</mark1><br>
That trade's proud empire hastes to swift <mark1>decay,</mark1><br>
As ocean sweeps the labour'd mole <mark1>away;</mark1><br>
While self-dependent power can time <mark3>defy,</mark3><br>
As rocks resist the billows and the <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
