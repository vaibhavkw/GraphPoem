Title : Hanging Fire <br>
Author : Audre Lorde <br><br>

I am <mark4>fourteen</mark4><br>
and my skin has betrayed <mark1>me</mark1><br>
the boy I cannot live <mark4>without</mark4><br>
still sucks his <mark4>thumb</mark4><br>
in <mark4>secret</mark4><br>
how come my knees are <br>
always so <mark4>ashy</mark4><br>
what if I die <br>
before morning <br>
and momma's in the <mark4>bedroom</mark4><br>
with the door <mark1>closed.</mark1><br>
<br>
I have to learn how to dance   <br>
in time for the next <mark4>party</mark4><br>
my room is too small for <mark1>me</mark1><br>
suppose I die before <mark4>graduation</mark4><br>
they will sing sad <mark4>melodies</mark4><br>
but <mark4>finally</mark4><br>
tell the truth about <mark1>me</mark1><br>
There is nothing I want to do   <br>
and too much <br>
that has to be <mark4>done</mark4><br>
and momma's in the <mark1>bedroom</mark1><br>
with the door <mark1>closed.</mark1><br>
<br>
Nobody even stops to think   <br>
about my side of <mark3>it</mark3><br>
I should have been on Math <mark4>Team</mark4><br>
my marks were better than <mark4>his</mark4><br>
why do I have to <mark3>be</mark3><br>
the <mark3>one</mark3><br>
wearing <mark4>braces</mark4><br>
I have nothing to wear tomorrow   <br>
will I live long enough <br>
to grow up <br>
and momma's in the <mark1>bedroom</mark1><br>
with the door <mark1>closed.</mark1><br>
