Title : Cui Bono <br>
Author : Thomas Carlyle <br><br>

What is Hope? A smiling rainbow <br>
Children follow through the <mark3>wet;</mark3><br>
'Tis not here, still <mark1>yonder</mark1>, <mark1>yonder:</mark1><br>
Never urchin found it <mark3>yet.</mark3><br>
<br>
What is Life? A thawing iceboard <br>
On a sea with sunny <mark3>shore;--</mark3><br>
Gay we sail; it melts beneath <mark4>us;</mark4><br>
We are sunk, and seen no <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
<br>
What is Man? A foolish baby, <br>
Vainly strives, and <mark4>fights</mark4>, and <mark4>frets;</mark4><br>
Demanding all, deserving nothing;-- <br>
One small grave is what he <mark3>gets.</mark3><br>
