Title : I Heard an Angel <br>
Author : William Blake <br><br>

I heard an Angel <mark3>singing</mark3><br>
When the day was <mark3>springing</mark3><br>
Mercy Pity <mark3>Peace</mark3><br>
Is the worlds <mark3>release</mark3><br>
<br>
Thus he sung all <mark3>day</mark3><br>
Over the new mown <mark3>hay</mark3><br>
Till the sun went <mark3>down</mark3><br>
And haycocks looked <mark3>brown</mark3><br>
<br>
I heard a Devil <mark4>curse</mark4><br>
Over the heath & the furze <br>
Mercy could be no <mark4>more</mark4><br>
If there was nobody <mark4>poor</mark4><br>
<br>
And pity no more could <mark3>be</mark3><br>
If all were as happy as <mark3>we</mark3><br>
At his curse the sun went <mark1>down</mark1><br>
And the heavens gave a <mark3>frown</mark3><br>
<br>
Down pourd the heavy <mark4>rain</mark4><br>
Over the new reapd <mark3>grain</mark3><br>
And Miseries <mark4>increase</mark4><br>
Is Mercy Pity <mark1>Peace</mark1><br>
