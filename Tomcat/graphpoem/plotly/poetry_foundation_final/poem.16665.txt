Title : A Day on the Big Branch <br>
Author : Howard Nemerov <br><br>

Still half drunk, after a night at <mark4>cards,</mark4><br>
with the grey dawn taking us <mark4>unaware</mark4><br>
among our guilty kings and queens, we drove<br>
far North in the morning, <mark4>winners</mark4>, <mark4>losers,</mark4><br>
to a stream in the high hills, to climb up to a <mark4>place</mark4><br>
one of us <mark3>knew</mark3>, with some vague <mark3>view</mark3><br>
of cutting losses or consolidating <mark4>gains</mark4><br>
by the old standard appeal to the <mark4>wilderness,</mark4><br>
the desert, the empty places of our <mark4>exile,</mark4><br>
bringing only the biblical bread and <mark4>cheese</mark4><br>
and cigarettes got from a grocer's on the <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
expecting to drink only the clear cold <mark5>water</mark5><br>
among the stones, and remember, or <mark4>forget.</mark4><br>
Though no one said anything about <mark4>atonement,</mark4><br>
there was still some purgatorial <mark5>idea</mark5><br>
in all those aching heads and ageing <mark4>hearts</mark4><br>
as we climbed the giant stair of the <mark4>stream,</mark4><br>
reaching the place around <mark4>noon.</mark4><br>
<br>
It was as promised, a wonder, with granite <mark4>walls</mark4><br>
enclosing ledges, long and flat, of <mark4>limestone,</mark4><br>
or, rolling, of lava; within the <mark4>ledges</mark4><br>
the water, fast and still, pouring its yellow <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
and green, over the tilted slabs of the <mark4>floor,</mark4><br>
blackened at shady corners, falling in a <mark4>foam</mark4><br>
of crystal to a calm where the <mark5>waterlight</mark5><br>
dappled the ledges as they <mark4>leaned</mark4><br>
against the sun; big blue dragonflies <mark4>hovered</mark4><br>
and darted and dipped a wing, hovered <mark4>again</mark4><br>
against the low wind moving over the <mark1>stream,</mark1><br>
and shook the flakes of light from their clear <mark4>wings.</mark4><br>
This surely was it, was what we had come <mark3>for,</mark3><br>
was nature, though it looked like art with <mark4>its</mark4><br>
grey fortress walls and laminated <mark4>benches</mark4><br>
as in the waiting room of some petrified <mark4>station.</mark4><br>
But we <mark1>believed</mark1>, and what it was we <mark4>believed</mark4><br>
made of the place a <mark4>paradise</mark4><br>
for ruined poker <mark4>players</mark4>, win or <mark4>lose,</mark4><br>
who stripped naked and bathed and dried out on the <mark4>rocks</mark4><br>
like gasping trout (the water they <mark4>drank</mark4><br>
making them drunk again), lit cigarettes and lay <mark4>back</mark4><br>
waiting for nature to say the last <mark4>word</mark4><br>
--as though the stones were Memnon <mark4>stones,</mark4><br>
which, caught in a certain light, would <mark4>sing.</mark4><br>
<br>
The silence (and even the noise of the <mark4>waters</mark4><br>
was silence) grew pregnant; that is the <mark4>phrase,</mark4><br>
grew pregnant; but nothing else <mark4>did.</mark4><br>
The mountains brought forth not a <mark4>mouse</mark4>, and the <mark1>rocks,</mark1><br>
unlike the ones you would expect to <mark4>find</mark4><br>
on the slopes of Purgatory or near <mark4>Helicon,</mark4><br>
mollified by muses and with a little give to <mark4>'em,</mark4><br>
were modern American <mark1>rocks</mark1>, and hard as <mark1>rocks.</mark1><br>
Our easy bones groaned, our flesh <mark4>baked</mark4><br>
on one side and shuddered on the other; and each <mark4>man</mark4><br>
thought bitterly about primitive <mark4>simplicity</mark4><br>
and decadence, and how he had been <mark4>ruined</mark4><br>
by civilization and forced by <mark4>circumstances</mark4><br>
to drink and smoke and sit up all <mark4>night</mark4><br>
inspecting those perfectly arbitrary <mark1>cards</mark1><br>
until he was broken-winded as a trout on a <mark4>rock</mark4><br>
and had no use for the doctrines of Jean <mark3>Jacques</mark3><br>
Rousseau, and could no longer <mark4>afford</mark4><br>
a savagery whether noble or not; <mark4>some</mark4><br>
would never batter that battered copy of <mark4>Walden</mark4><br>
<br>
But all the <mark4>same,</mark4><br>
the water, the sunlight, and the <mark4>wind</mark4><br>
did something; even the <mark5>dragonflies</mark5><br>
did something to the minds full of <mark4>telephone</mark4><br>
numbers and flushes, to the <mark1>flesh</mark1><br>
sweating bourbon on one side and freezing on the <mark4>other.</mark4><br>
And the rocks, the old and tumbling <mark4>boulders</mark4><br>
which formed the giant stair of the <mark1>stream,</mark1><br>
induced (again) some purgatorial <mark4>ideas</mark4><br>
concerning humility, concerning <mark4>patience</mark4><br>
and enduring what had to be <mark4>endured,</mark4><br>
winning and losing and breaking <mark4>even;</mark4><br>
ideas of weathering in whatever <mark4>weather,</mark4><br>
being eroded, or broken, or ground down into <mark4>pebbles</mark4><br>
by the stream's necessitous and grave <mark4>currents.</mark4><br>
But to these ideas did any <mark4>purgatory</mark4><br>
respond? Only this one: that in a <mark4>world</mark4><br>
where even the Memnon stones were carved in <mark1>soap</mark1><br>
one might at any rate wash with the <mark1>soap.</mark1><br>
After a time we talked about the <mark3>War,</mark3><br>
<br>
about what we had done in the <mark4>War</mark4>, and how <mark4>near</mark4><br>
some of us had been to being <mark4>drowned</mark4>, and <mark4>burned,</mark4><br>
and shot, and how many people we <mark3>knew</mark3><br>
who had been drowned, or burned, or <mark4>shot;</mark4><br>
and would it have been better to have <mark4>died</mark4><br>
in the War, the peaceful old War, where we were <mark4>young?</mark4><br>
But the mineral peace, or paralysis, of <mark4>those</mark4><br>
great <mark4>stones</mark4>, the moving stillness of the <mark1>waters,</mark1><br>
entered our speech; the ribs and <mark4>blood</mark4><br>
of the earth, from which all fables grow,<br>
established poetry and truth in <mark4>us,</mark4><br>
so that at last one said, "I shall play <mark1>cards</mark1><br>
until the day I die," and another <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
"in bourbon whisky are all the <mark4>vitamins</mark4><br>
and minerals needed to sustain man's life,"<br>
and still another, "I shall live on <mark4>smoke</mark4><br>
until my spirit has been cured of <mark1>flesh."</mark1><br>
Climbing downstream again, on the way <mark4>home</mark4><br>
<br>
to the lives we had left empty for a <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
we noticed, as not before, how of three <mark4>bridges</mark4><br>
not one had held the stream, which in its <mark4>floods</mark4><br>
had twisted the girders, splintered the boards, <mark4>hurled</mark4><br>
boulder on boulder, and had broken into <mark4>rubble,</mark4><br>
smashed practically back to <mark4>nature,</mark4><br>
the massive masonry of span after <mark4>span</mark4><br>
with its indifferent rage; this was a <mark4>sight</mark4><br>
that sobered us considerably, and kept us <mark4>quiet</mark4><br>
both during the long drive home and <mark4>after,</mark4><br>
till it was time to deal the <mark1>cards.</mark1><br>
