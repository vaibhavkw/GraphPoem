Title : Sonnet 33: Full many a glorious morning have I seen <br>
Author : William Shakespeare <br><br>

Full many a glorious morning have I <mark3>seen</mark3><br>
Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye, <br>
Kissing with golden face the meadows <mark3>green,</mark3><br>
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy; <br>
Anon permit the basest clouds to <mark3>ride</mark3><br>
With ugly rack on his celestial <mark3>face</mark3><br>
And from the forlorn world his visage <mark3>hide,</mark3><br>
Stealing unseen to west with this <mark3>disgrace.</mark3><br>
Even so my sun one early morn did <mark4>shine</mark4><br>
With all-triumphant splendour on my <mark3>brow;</mark3><br>
But out, alack! he was but one hour <mark3>mine;</mark3><br>
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me <mark3>now.</mark3><br>
Yet him for this my love no whit <mark5>disdaineth;</mark5><br>
Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.<br>
