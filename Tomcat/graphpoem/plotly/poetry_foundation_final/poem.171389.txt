Title : Another Night in the Ruins <br>
Author : Galway Kinnell <br><br>

<br>
In the <mark4>evening</mark4><br>
haze darkening on the <mark4>hills,</mark4><br>
purple of the eternal,   <br>
a last bird crosses <mark4>over,</mark4><br>
'flop flop,' <mark4>adoring</mark4><br>
only the <mark4>instant.</mark4><br>
<br>
Nine years <mark3>ago,</mark3><br>
in a plane that rumbled all <mark4>night</mark4><br>
above the <mark1>Atlantic,</mark1><br>
I could see, lit up <br>
by lightning bolts jumping out of <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
a thunderhead formed like the <mark4>face</mark4><br>
of my brother, looking <mark4>down</mark4><br>
on <mark3>blue,</mark3><br>
lightning-flashed moments of the <mark1>Atlantic.</mark1><br>
He used to tell <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
<br>
"What good is the <mark3>day?</mark3><br>
On some hill of despair   <br>
the <mark4>bonfire</mark4><br>
you kindle can light the great sky-- <br>
though it's true, of course, to make it <mark4>burn</mark4><br>
you have to throw yourself in <mark4>..."</mark4><br>
Wind tears itself hollow <br>
in the eaves of these ruins, <mark4>ghost-flute</mark4><br>
<br>
of <mark5>snowdrifts</mark5><br>
that build out there in the <mark4>dark:</mark4><br>
upside-down <mark4>ravines</mark4><br>
into which night <mark4>sweeps</mark4><br>
our cast <mark4>wings</mark4>, our ink-spattered <mark4>feathers.</mark4><br>
I <mark4>listen.</mark4><br>
I hear nothing. <mark4>Only</mark4><br>
the cow, the cow of such   <br>
<br>
hollowness, mooing <br>
down the <mark4>bones.</mark4><br>
Is that <mark3>a</mark3><br>
rooster? <mark3>He</mark3><br>
thrashes in the <mark3>snow</mark3><br>
for a grain. <mark4>Finds</mark4><br>
<br>
it. <mark4>Rips</mark4><br>
it <mark3>into</mark3><br>
flames. Flaps. <mark4>Crows.</mark4><br>
bursting out of his brow. <br>
How many nights must it <mark4>take</mark4><br>
one such as me to <mark4>learn</mark4><br>
that we aren't, after all, made <br>
from that bird that flies out of its <mark4>ashes,</mark4><br>
<br>
that for <mark4>us</mark4><br>
<br>
as we go up in flames, our one <mark4>work</mark4><br>
to open ourselves, to <mark3>be</mark3><br>
the <mark4>flames?</mark4><br>
