Title : Modern Love: XXII <br>
Author : George Meredith <br><br>

What may the woman labour to <mark3>confess?</mark3><br>
There is about her mouth a nervous twitch.<br>
'Tis something to be told, or hidden:?which?<br>
I get a glimpse of hell in this mild <mark3>guess.</mark3><br>
She has desires of touch, as if to <mark3>feel</mark3><br>
That all the household things are things she <mark3>knew.</mark3><br>
She stops before the glass. What sight in <mark3>view?</mark3><br>
A face that seems the latest to <mark3>reveal!</mark3><br>
For she turns from it hastily, and <mark3>tossed</mark3><br>
Irresolute, steals shadow-like to <mark3>where</mark3><br>
I stand; and wavering pale before me <mark3>there,</mark3><br>
Her tears fall still as oak-leaves after <mark3>frost.</mark3><br>
She will not speak. I will not ask. We <mark4>are</mark4><br>
League-sundered by the silent gulf <mark3>between.</mark3><br>
Yon burly lovers on the village <mark3>green,</mark3><br>
Yours is a lower, and a happier <mark3>star!</mark3><br>
