Title : The Ache of Marriage <br>
Author : Denise Levertov <br><br>

The ache of marriage: <br>
<br>
thigh and tongue, <mark1>beloved,</mark1><br>
are heavy with <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
it throbs in the teeth <br>
<br>
We look for communion <br>
and are turned away, <mark1>beloved,</mark1><br>
each and each <br>
<br>
It is leviathan and we   <br>
in its <mark5>belly</mark5><br>
looking for <mark1>joy</mark1>, some <mark1>joy</mark1><br>
not to be known outside <mark1>it</mark1><br>
<br>
two by two in the ark of   <br>
the ache of <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
