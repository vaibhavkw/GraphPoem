Title : In the Valley of Cauteretz <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

<br>
All along the valley, stream that flashest <mark3>white,</mark3><br>
Deepening thy voice with the deepening of the <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
All along the valley, where thy waters <mark3>flow,</mark3><br>
I walk'd with one I loved two and thirty years <mark3>ago.</mark3><br>
All along the valley, while I walk'd <mark3>to-day,</mark3><br>
The two and thirty years were a mist that rolls <mark3>away;</mark3><br>
For all along the valley, down thy rocky <mark3>bed,</mark3><br>
Thy living voice to me was as the voice of the <mark3>dead,</mark3><br>
And all along the valley, by rock and cave and <mark3>tree,</mark3><br>
The voice of the dead was a living voice to <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
