Title : Difference <br>
Author : Stephen Vincent Benet <br><br>

My mind's a map. A mad sea-captain drew <mark1>it</mark1><br>
Under a flowing moon until he knew <mark1>it;</mark1><br>
Winds with brass trumpets, puffy-cheeked as <mark3>jugs,</mark3><br>
And states bright-patterned like Arabian <mark3>rugs.</mark3><br>
"Here there be tygers." "Here we buried <mark3>Jim."</mark3><br>
Here is the strait where eyeless fishes <mark3>swim</mark3><br>
About their buried idol, drowned so <mark3>cold</mark3><br>
He weeps away his eyes in salt and <mark3>gold.</mark3><br>
A country like the dark side of the <mark3>moon,</mark3><br>
A cider-apple country, harsh and <mark3>boon,</mark3><br>
A country savage as a <mark4>chestnut-rind,</mark4><br>
A land of hungry <mark4>sorcerers.</mark4><br>
Your <mark3>mind?</mark3><br>
<br>
--Your mind is water through an April <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
A cherry-branch, plume-feathery with its <mark3>white,</mark3><br>
A lavender as fragrant as your <mark4>words,</mark4><br>
A room where Peace and Honor talk like <mark3>birds,</mark3><br>
Sewing bright coins upon the tragic <mark3>cloth</mark3><br>
Of heavy Fate, and Mockery, like a <mark3>moth,</mark3><br>
Flutters and beats about those lovely <mark4>things.</mark4><br>
You are the soul, enchanted with its <mark3>wings,</mark3><br>
The single voice that raises up the <mark4>dead</mark4><br>
To shake the pride of <mark4>angels.</mark4><br>
I have <mark3>said.</mark3><br>
