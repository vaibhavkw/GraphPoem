Title : Heaven <br>
Author : Cathy Song <br><br>

He thinks when we die we'll go to China. <br>
Think of it--a Chinese <mark4>heaven</mark4><br>
<mark3>where</mark3>, except for his blond <mark3>hair,</mark3><br>
the part that belongs to his <mark4>father,</mark4><br>
everyone will look like <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
China, that blue flower on the <mark4>map,</mark4><br>
bluer than the <mark1>sea</mark1><br>
his hand must span like a bridge   <br>
to reach <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
An octave <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
<br>
I've never seen <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
It's as if I can't sing that <mark4>far.</mark4><br>
But <mark4>look--</mark4><br>
on the map, this black <mark4>dot.</mark4><br>
Here is where we <mark4>live,</mark4><br>
on the pancake <mark4>plains</mark4><br>
just east of the <mark4>Rockies,</mark4><br>
on the other side of the <mark4>clouds.</mark4><br>
A mile above the <mark1>sea,</mark1><br>
the air is so thin, you can starve on <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
No bamboo <mark4>trees</mark4><br>
but the alpine <mark4>equivalent,</mark4><br>
reedy aspen with light, fluttering <mark4>leaves.</mark4><br>
Did a boy in Guangzhou dream of this   <br>
as his last <mark4>stop?</mark4><br>
<br>
I've heard the trains at <mark4>night</mark4><br>
whistling past our <mark4>yards,</mark4><br>
what we've come to <mark4>own,</mark4><br>
the broken fences, the whiny dog, the rattletrap <mark4>cars.</mark4><br>
It's still the wild <mark4>west,</mark4><br>
mean and <mark4>grubby,</mark4><br>
the shootouts and fistfights in the back <mark4>alley.</mark4><br>
With my son the <mark4>dreamer</mark4><br>
and my daughter, who is too young to <mark4>walk,</mark4><br>
I've sat in this <mark4>spot</mark4><br>
and wondered why <mark4>here?</mark4><br>
Why in this short life, <br>
this town, this creek they call a <mark4>river?</mark4><br>
<br>
He had never planned to <mark3>stay,</mark3><br>
the boy who helped to <mark4>build</mark4><br>
the railroads for a dollar a <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
He had always meant to go <mark4>back.</mark4><br>
When did he finally know <br>
that each mile of track led him further <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
that he would die in his <mark4>sleep,</mark4><br>
<br>
having seen Gold <mark4>Mountain,</mark4><br>
the icy wind tunneling through <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
these landlocked, makeshift ghost <mark4>towns?</mark4><br>
<br>
It must be in the <mark4>blood,</mark4><br>
this notion of <mark4>returning.</mark4><br>
It skipped two generations, lay fallow, <br>
the garden an unmarked <mark4>grave.</mark4><br>
On a spring sweater <mark1>day</mark1><br>
it's as if we remember <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
I call to the <mark4>children.</mark4><br>
We can see the <mark4>mountains</mark4><br>
shimmering blue above the <mark4>air.</mark4><br>
If you look really <mark4>hard</mark4><br>
says my son the <mark1>dreamer,</mark1><br>
leaning out from the laundry's <mark4>rigging,</mark4><br>
the work shirts fluttering like <mark4>sails,</mark4><br>
you can see all the way to <mark1>heaven.</mark1><br>
