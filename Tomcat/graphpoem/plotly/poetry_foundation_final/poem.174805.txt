Title : Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood <br>
Author : William Wordsworth <br><br>

The child is father of the <mark4>man;</mark4><br>
And I could wish my days to <mark4>be</mark4><br>
Bound each to each by natural <mark4>piety.</mark4><br>
(Wordsworth, "My Heart Leaps <mark4>Up")</mark4><br>
There was a time when meadow, grove, and <mark3>stream,</mark3><br>
The earth, and every common <mark3>sight,</mark3><br>
To me did <mark3>seem</mark3><br>
Apparelled in celestial <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
The glory and the freshness of a <mark3>dream.</mark3><br>
It is not now as it hath been of <mark3>yore;--</mark3><br>
Turn wheresoe'er I <mark3>may,</mark3><br>
By night or <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
The things which I have seen I now can see no <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
<br>
The Rainbow comes and <mark3>goes,</mark3><br>
And lovely is the <mark3>Rose,</mark3><br>
The Moon doth with <mark3>delight</mark3><br>
Look round her when the heavens are <mark4>bare,</mark4><br>
Waters on a starry <mark3>night</mark3><br>
Are beautiful and <mark3>fair;</mark3><br>
The sunshine is a glorious <mark3>birth;</mark3><br>
But yet I <mark3>know</mark3>, where'er I <mark3>go,</mark3><br>
That there hath past away a glory from the <mark3>earth.</mark3><br>
<br>
Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous <mark3>song,</mark3><br>
And while the young lambs <mark3>bound</mark3><br>
As to the tabor's <mark3>sound,</mark3><br>
To me alone there came a thought of <mark3>grief:</mark3><br>
A timely utterance gave that thought <mark3>relief,</mark3><br>
And I again am <mark3>strong:</mark3><br>
The cataracts blow their trumpets from the <mark4>steep;</mark4><br>
No more shall grief of mine the season <mark3>wrong;</mark3><br>
I hear the Echoes through the mountains <mark3>throng,</mark3><br>
The Winds come to me from the fields of <mark3>sleep,</mark3><br>
And all the earth is <mark3>gay;</mark3><br>
Land and <mark3>sea</mark3><br>
               Give themselves up to jollity,<br>
And with the heart of <mark1>May</mark1><br>
               Doth every Beast keep holiday;--<br>
Thou Child of <mark3>Joy,</mark3><br>
Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy <mark3>Shepherd-boy.</mark3><br>
<br>
Ye blessed creatures, I have heard the <mark4>call</mark4><br>
Ye to each other make; I <mark2>see</mark2><br>
The heavens laugh with you in your <mark3>jubilee;</mark3><br>
My heart is at your <mark4>festival,</mark4><br>
My head hath its <mark4>coronal,</mark4><br>
The fulness of your bliss, I feel--I feel it <mark4>all.</mark4><br>
Oh evil day! if I were <mark4>sullen</mark4><br>
While Earth herself is <mark4>adorning,</mark4><br>
This sweet <mark3>May-morning,</mark3><br>
And the Children are <mark4>culling</mark4><br>
On every <mark4>side,</mark4><br>
In a thousand valleys far and <mark3>wide,</mark3><br>
Fresh flowers; while the sun shines <mark4>warm,</mark4><br>
And the Babe leaps up on his Mother's <mark4>arm:--</mark4><br>
I <mark1>hear</mark1>, I hear, with joy I <mark4>hear!</mark4><br>
--But there's a Tree, of many, <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
A single field which I have looked <mark4>upon,</mark4><br>
Both of them speak of something that is <mark4>gone;</mark4><br>
The Pansy at my <mark4>feet</mark4><br>
Doth the same tale <mark3>repeat:</mark3><br>
Whither is fled the visionary <mark4>gleam?</mark4><br>
Where is it now, the glory and the <mark1>dream?</mark1><br>
<br>
Our birth is but a sleep and a <mark4>forgetting:</mark4><br>
The Soul that rises with us, our life's <mark4>Star,</mark4><br>
Hath had elsewhere its <mark3>setting,</mark3><br>
And cometh from <mark3>afar:</mark3><br>
Not in entire <mark5>forgetfulness,</mark5><br>
                      And not in utter nakedness,<br>
But trailing clouds of glory do we <mark4>come</mark4><br>
From God, who is our <mark4>home:</mark4><br>
Heaven lies about us in our <mark4>infancy!</mark4><br>
Shades of the prison-house begin to <mark3>close</mark3><br>
Upon the growing <mark3>Boy,</mark3><br>
But he beholds the light, and whence it <mark3>flows,</mark3><br>
He sees it in his <mark1>joy;</mark1><br>
The Youth, who daily farther from the <mark4>east</mark4><br>
Must travel, still is Nature's <mark3>Priest,</mark3><br>
And by the vision <mark4>splendid</mark4><br>
Is on his way <mark4>attended;</mark4><br>
At length the Man perceives it die <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
And fade into the light of common <mark1>day.</mark1><br>
<br>
Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her <mark4>own;</mark4><br>
Yearnings she hath in her own natural <mark4>kind,</mark4><br>
<mark4>And</mark4>, even with something of a Mother's <mark3>mind,</mark3><br>
And no unworthy <mark4>aim,</mark4><br>
The homely Nurse doth all she <mark4>can</mark4><br>
To make her Foster-child, her Inmate <mark1>Man,</mark1><br>
Forget the glories he hath <mark4>known,</mark4><br>
And that imperial palace whence he <mark3>came.</mark3><br>
<br>
Behold the Child among his new-born <mark5>blisses,</mark5><br>
A six years' Darling of a pigmy <mark4>size!</mark4><br>
See, where 'mid work of his own hand he <mark3>lies,</mark3><br>
Fretted by sallies of his mother's <mark4>kisses,</mark4><br>
With light upon him from his father's <mark4>eyes!</mark4><br>
See, at his <mark4>feet</mark4>, some little plan or <mark4>chart,</mark4><br>
Some fragment from his dream of human <mark4>life,</mark4><br>
Shaped by himself with newly-learn{e}d <mark3>art</mark3><br>
A wedding or a <mark1>festival,</mark1><br>
A mourning or a <mark4>funeral;</mark4><br>
And this hath now his <mark3>heart,</mark3><br>
And unto this he frames his <mark1>song:</mark1><br>
Then will he fit his <mark4>tongue</mark4><br>
To dialogues of business, love, or <mark3>strife;</mark3><br>
But it will not be <mark4>long</mark4><br>
Ere this be thrown <mark4>aside,</mark4><br>
And with new joy and <mark3>pride</mark3><br>
The little Actor cons another <mark3>part;</mark3><br>
Filling from time to time his "humorous <mark3>stage"</mark3><br>
With all the Persons, down to palsied <mark3>Age,</mark3><br>
That Life brings with her in her equipage;<br>
As if his whole <mark4>vocation</mark4><br>
Were endless <mark3>imitation.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thou, whose exterior semblance doth <mark3>belie</mark3><br>
                      Thy Soul's immensity;<br>
Thou best Philosopher, who yet dost <mark3>keep</mark3><br>
Thy heritage, thou Eye among the <mark4>blind,</mark4><br>
That, deaf and silent, read'st the eternal <mark3>deep,</mark3><br>
Haunted for ever by the eternal <mark1>mind,--</mark1><br>
Mighty Prophet! Seer <mark4>blest!</mark4><br>
On whom those truths do <mark3>rest,</mark3><br>
Which we are toiling all our lives to <mark3>find,</mark3><br>
In darkness lost, the darkness of the <mark3>grave;</mark3><br>
Thou, over whom thy <mark4>Immortality</mark4><br>
Broods like the Day, a Master o'er a <mark3>Slave,</mark3><br>
A Presence which is not to be put <mark3>by;</mark3><br>
Thou little Child, yet glorious in the <mark4>might</mark4><br>
Of heaven-born freedom on thy being's <mark3>height,</mark3><br>
Why with such earnest pains dost thou <mark3>provoke</mark3><br>
The years to bring the inevitable <mark3>yoke,</mark3><br>
Thus blindly with thy blessedness at <mark1>strife?</mark1><br>
Full soon thy Soul shall have her earthly <mark4>freight,</mark4><br>
And custom lie upon thee with a <mark3>weight,</mark3><br>
Heavy as frost, and deep almost as <mark1>life!</mark1><br>
<br>
O joy! that in our <mark4>embers</mark4><br>
Is something that doth <mark4>live,</mark4><br>
That Nature yet <mark3>remembers</mark3><br>
What was so <mark4>fugitive!</mark4><br>
The thought of our past years in me doth <mark4>breed</mark4><br>
Perpetual benediction: not <mark3>indeed</mark3><br>
For that which is most worthy to be <mark1>blest;</mark1><br>
Delight and liberty, the simple <mark3>creed</mark3><br>
Of Childhood, whether busy or at <mark1>rest,</mark1><br>
With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his <mark3>breast:--</mark3><br>
Not for these I <mark4>raise</mark4><br>
The song of thanks and <mark3>praise</mark3><br>
But for those obstinate <mark4>questionings</mark4><br>
Of sense and outward <mark4>things,</mark4><br>
               Fallings from us, vanishings;<br>
Blank misgivings of a <mark4>Creature</mark4><br>
Moving about in worlds not <mark4>realised,</mark4><br>
High instincts before which our mortal <mark4>Nature</mark4><br>
Did tremble like a guilty thing <mark4>surprised:</mark4><br>
But for those first <mark4>affections,</mark4><br>
Those shadowy <mark3>recollections,</mark3><br>
Which, be they what they <mark1>may</mark1><br>
Are yet the fountain-light of all our <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
Are yet a master-light of all our <mark4>seeing;</mark4><br>
Uphold us, cherish, and have power to <mark4>make</mark4><br>
Our noisy years seem moments in the <mark3>being</mark3><br>
Of the eternal Silence: truths that <mark3>wake,</mark3><br>
To perish <mark4>never;</mark4><br>
Which neither listlessness, nor mad <mark3>endeavour,</mark3><br>
Nor Man nor <mark1>Boy,</mark1><br>
Nor all that is at enmity with <mark1>joy,</mark1><br>
Can utterly abolish or <mark3>destroy!</mark3><br>
Hence in a season of calm <mark4>weather</mark4><br>
Though inland far we <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
Our Souls have sight of that immortal <mark1>sea</mark1><br>
Which brought us <mark4>hither,</mark4><br>
Can in a moment travel <mark5>thither,</mark5><br>
And see the Children sport upon the <mark4>shore,</mark4><br>
And hear the mighty waters rolling <mark4>evermore.</mark4><br>
<br>
Then <mark4>sing</mark4>, ye Birds, sing, sing a joyous <mark1>song!</mark1><br>
And let the young Lambs <mark1>bound</mark1><br>
As to the tabor's <mark1>sound!</mark1><br>
We in thought will join your <mark1>throng,</mark1><br>
Ye that pipe and ye that <mark3>play,</mark3><br>
Ye that through your hearts <mark3>to-day</mark3><br>
Feel the gladness of the <mark1>May!</mark1><br>
What though the radiance which was once so <mark4>bright</mark4><br>
Be now for ever taken from my <mark1>sight,</mark1><br>
Though nothing can bring back the <mark4>hour</mark4><br>
Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the <mark3>flower;</mark3><br>
We will grieve not, rather <mark1>find</mark1><br>
Strength in what remains <mark3>behind;</mark3><br>
In the primal <mark4>sympathy</mark4><br>
Which having been must ever <mark1>be;</mark1><br>
In the soothing thoughts that <mark4>spring</mark4><br>
Out of human <mark4>suffering;</mark4><br>
In the faith that looks through <mark4>death,</mark4><br>
In years that bring the philosophic <mark1>mind.</mark1><br>
And O, ye Fountains, Meadows, <mark4>Hills</mark4>, and <mark4>Groves,</mark4><br>
Forebode not any severing of our <mark4>loves!</mark4><br>
Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your <mark1>might;</mark1><br>
I only have relinquished one <mark1>delight</mark1><br>
To live beneath your more habitual <mark3>sway.</mark3><br>
I love the Brooks which down their channels <mark4>fret,</mark4><br>
Even more than when I tripped lightly as <mark3>they;</mark3><br>
The innocent brightness of a new-born <mark1>Day</mark1><br>
Is lovely <mark3>yet;</mark3><br>
The Clouds that gather round the setting <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
Do take a sober colouring from an <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
That hath kept watch o'er man's <mark4>mortality;</mark4><br>
Another race hath <mark4>been</mark4>, and other palms are <mark3>won.</mark3><br>
Thanks to the human heart by which we <mark1>live,</mark1><br>
Thanks to its tenderness, its <mark4>joys</mark4>, and <mark4>fears,</mark4><br>
To me the meanest flower that blows can <mark3>give</mark3><br>
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for <mark3>tears.</mark3><br>
