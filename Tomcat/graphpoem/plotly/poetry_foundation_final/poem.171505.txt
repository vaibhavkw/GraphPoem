Title : Walking West <br>
Author : William E. Stafford <br><br>

Anyone with quiet pace who <br>
walks a gray road in the <mark4>West</mark4><br>
may hear a badger underground <mark3>where</mark3><br>
in deep flint another time is <br>
<br>
Caught by flint and held <mark4>forever,</mark4><br>
the quiet pace of God stopped <mark4>still.</mark4><br>
Anyone who listens walks on   <br>
time that dogs him single <mark4>file,</mark4><br>
<br>
To mountains that are far from <mark4>people,</mark4><br>
the face of the land gone gray like <mark4>flint.</mark4><br>
Badgers dig their little lives <mark3>there,</mark3><br>
quiet-paced the land lies <mark4>gaunt,</mark4><br>
<br>
The railroad dies by a yellow depot,   <br>
town falls away toward a muddy <mark4>creek.</mark4><br>
Badger-gray the sod goes <mark4>under</mark4><br>
a river of wind, a hawk on a <mark4>stick.</mark4><br>
