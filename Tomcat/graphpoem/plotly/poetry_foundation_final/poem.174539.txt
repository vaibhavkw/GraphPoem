Title : Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift, D.S.P.D. <br>
Author : Jonathan Swift <br><br>

Dans l'adversite de nos meilleurs amis nous trouvons quelque chose, qui ne nous deplait pas. ["In the hard times of our best friends we find something that doesn't displease <mark1>us."]</mark1><br>
As Rochefoucauld his maxims <mark3>drew</mark3><br>
From Nature, I believe 'em <mark3>true:</mark3><br>
They argue no corrupted <mark3>mind</mark3><br>
In him; the fault is in <mark3>mankind.</mark3><br>
<br>
This maxim more than all the <mark3>rest</mark3><br>
Is thought too base for human <mark3>breast:</mark3><br>
"In all distresses of our <mark3>friends,</mark3><br>
We first consult our private <mark3>ends;</mark3><br>
<br>
While Nature, kindly bent to ease <mark1>us,</mark1><br>
Points out some circumstance to please <mark1>us."</mark1><br>
<br>
If this perhaps your patience <mark3>move,</mark3><br>
Let reason and experience <mark3>prove.</mark3><br>
<br>
We all behold with envious <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
Our equal rais'd above our <mark3>size.</mark3><br>
Who would not at a crowded <mark3>show</mark3><br>
Stand high himself, keep others <mark3>low?</mark3><br>
I love my friend as well as <mark3>you</mark3><br>
But would not have him stop my <mark3>view.</mark3><br>
Then let him have the higher <mark4>post:</mark4><br>
I ask but for an inch at <mark3>most.</mark3><br>
<br>
If in a battle you should <mark3>find</mark3><br>
One, whom you love of all <mark1>mankind,</mark1><br>
Had some heroic action <mark3>done,</mark3><br>
A champion kill'd, or trophy <mark3>won;</mark3><br>
Rather than thus be <mark5>overtopt,</mark5><br>
Would you not wish his laurels <mark5>cropt?</mark5><br>
<br>
Dear honest Ned is in the <mark4>gout,</mark4><br>
Lies rack'd with pain, and you <mark3>without:</mark3><br>
How patiently you hear him <mark4>groan!</mark4><br>
How glad the case is not your <mark3>own!</mark3><br>
<br>
What poet would not grieve to <mark3>see</mark3><br>
His brethren write as well as <mark3>he?</mark3><br>
But rather than they should <mark3>excel,</mark3><br>
He'd wish his rivals all in <mark3>hell.</mark3><br>
<br>
Her end when emulation <mark4>misses,</mark4><br>
She turns to envy, stings and <mark3>hisses:</mark3><br>
The strongest friendship yields to <mark4>pride,</mark4><br>
Unless the odds be on our <mark3>side.</mark3><br>
<br>
Vain human kind! fantastic <mark4>race!</mark4><br>
Thy various follies who can <mark3>trace?</mark3><br>
Self-love, ambition, envy, <mark1>pride,</mark1><br>
Their empire in our hearts <mark3>divide.</mark3><br>
Give others riches, power, and <mark4>station,</mark4><br>
'Tis all on me a <mark3>usurpation.</mark3><br>
I have no title to <mark4>aspire;</mark4><br>
Yet, when you sink, I seem the <mark4>higher.</mark4><br>
In Pope I cannot read a <mark4>line,</mark4><br>
But with a sigh I wish it <mark3>mine;</mark3><br>
When he can in one couplet <mark4>fix</mark4><br>
More sense than I can do in <mark3>six;</mark3><br>
It gives me such a jealous <mark4>fit,</mark4><br>
I cry, "Pox take him and his <mark3>wit!"</mark3><br>
<br>
Why must I be outdone by <mark3>Gay</mark3><br>
In my own hum'rous biting <mark3>way?</mark3><br>
<br>
Arbuthnot is no more my <mark4>friend,</mark4><br>
Who dares to irony <mark3>pretend,</mark3><br>
Which I was born to <mark4>introduce,</mark4><br>
Refin'd it first, and show'd its <mark3>use.</mark3><br>
<br>
St. John, as well as Pultney, <mark4>knows</mark4><br>
That I had some repute for <mark3>prose;</mark3><br>
And, till they drove me out of <mark4>date,</mark4><br>
Could maul a minister of <mark3>state.</mark3><br>
If they have mortify'd my <mark1>pride,</mark1><br>
And made me throw my pen <mark3>aside;</mark3><br>
If with such talents Heav'n has blest <mark1>'em,</mark1><br>
Have I not reason to detest <mark1>'em?</mark1><br>
<br>
To all my foes, dear Fortune, <mark4>send</mark4><br>
Thy gifts; but never to my <mark1>friend:</mark1><br>
I tamely can endure the <mark4>first,</mark4><br>
But this with envy makes me <mark3>burst.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thus much may serve by way of <mark5>proem:</mark5><br>
Proceed we therefore to our <mark3>poem.</mark3><br>
<br>
The time is not remote, when <mark3>I</mark3><br>
Must by the course of nature <mark3>die;</mark3><br>
When I foresee my special <mark1>friends</mark1><br>
Will try to find their private <mark1>ends:</mark1><br>
Tho' it is hardly <mark4>understood</mark4><br>
Which way my death can do them <mark3>good,</mark3><br>
Yet thus, methinks, I hear 'em <mark4>speak:</mark4><br>
"See, how the Dean begins to <mark4>break!</mark4><br>
Poor gentleman, he droops <mark4>apace!</mark4><br>
You plainly find it in his <mark3>face.</mark3><br>
That old vertigo in his <mark4>head</mark4><br>
Will never leave him till he's <mark3>dead.</mark3><br>
<mark4>Besides</mark4>, his memory <mark4>decays:</mark4><br>
He recollects not what he <mark4>says;</mark4><br>
He cannot call his friends to <mark1>mind:</mark1><br>
Forgets the place where last he <mark4>din'd;</mark4><br>
Plies you with stories o'er and <mark4>o'er;</mark4><br>
He told them fifty times <mark4>before.</mark4><br>
How does he fancy we can <mark4>sit</mark4><br>
To hear his out-of-fashion'd <mark1>wit?</mark1><br>
But he takes up with younger <mark4>folks,</mark4><br>
Who for his wine will bear his <mark3>jokes.</mark3><br>
Faith, he must make his stories <mark4>shorter,</mark4><br>
Or change his comrades once a <mark3>quarter:</mark3><br>
In half the time he talks them <mark4>round,</mark4><br>
There must another set be <mark3>found.</mark3><br>
<br>
"For poetry he's past his <mark4>prime:</mark4><br>
He takes an hour to find a <mark3>rhyme;</mark3><br>
His fire is out, his wit <mark4>decay'd,</mark4><br>
His fancy sunk, his Muse a <mark4>jade.</mark4><br>
I'd have him throw away his <mark4>pen;--</mark4><br>
But there's no talking to some <mark3>men!"</mark3><br>
<br>
And then their tenderness <mark4>appears,</mark4><br>
By adding largely to my <mark3>years:</mark3><br>
"He's older than he would be <mark4>reckon'd</mark4><br>
And well remembers Charles the <mark4>Second.</mark4><br>
<br>
"He hardly drinks a pint of <mark4>wine;</mark4><br>
And that, I doubt, is no good <mark3>sign.</mark3><br>
His stomach too begins to <mark4>fail:</mark4><br>
Last year we thought him strong and <mark3>hale;</mark3><br>
But now he's quite another <mark3>thing:</mark3><br>
I wish he may hold out till <mark3>spring."</mark3><br>
<br>
Then hug themselves, and reason <mark4>thus:</mark4><br>
"It is not yet so bad with <mark1>us."</mark1><br>
<br>
       In such a case, they talk in tropes, <br>
And by their fears express their <mark4>hopes:</mark4><br>
Some great misfortune to <mark4>portend,</mark4><br>
No enemy can match a <mark1>friend.</mark1><br>
With all the kindness they <mark4>profess,</mark4><br>
The merit of a lucky <mark3>guess</mark3><br>
(When daily "How d'ye's" come of <mark4>course,</mark4><br>
And servants answer, "Worse and <mark4>worse!")</mark4><br>
Would please 'em better, than to <mark4>tell,</mark4><br>
That, "God be prais'd, the Dean is <mark3>well."</mark3><br>
Then he who prophecy'd the <mark4>best</mark4><br>
Approves his foresight to the <mark1>rest:</mark1><br>
"You know I always fear'd the <mark4>worst,</mark4><br>
And often told you so at <mark1>first."</mark1><br>
He'd rather choose that I should <mark1>die,</mark1><br>
Than his prediction prove a <mark3>lie.</mark3><br>
Not one foretells I shall <mark4>recover;</mark4><br>
But all agree to give me <mark4>over.</mark4><br>
<br>
Yet, should some neighbour feel a <mark4>pain</mark4><br>
Just in the parts where I <mark3>complain,</mark3><br>
How many a message would he <mark1>send?</mark1><br>
What hearty prayers that I should <mark3>mend?</mark3><br>
Inquire what regimen I <mark4>kept,</mark4><br>
What gave me ease, and how I <mark3>slept?</mark3><br>
And more lament when I was <mark1>dead,</mark1><br>
Than all the sniv'llers round my <mark3>bed.</mark3><br>
<br>
My good companions, never <mark4>fear;</mark4><br>
For though you may mistake a <mark3>year,</mark3><br>
Though your prognostics run too <mark4>fast,</mark4><br>
They must be verify'd at <mark3>last.</mark3><br>
<br>
Behold the fatal day <mark4>arrive!</mark4><br>
"How is the Dean?"--"He's just <mark3>alive."</mark3><br>
Now the departing prayer is <mark3>read;</mark3><br>
"He hardly breathes."--"The Dean is <mark1>dead."</mark1><br>
Before the passing-bell <mark4>begun,</mark4><br>
The news thro' half the town has <mark3>run.</mark3><br>
"O, may we all for death <mark4>prepare!</mark4><br>
What has he left? and who's his <mark3>heir?"--</mark3><br>
"I know no more than what the news <mark4>is;</mark4><br>
'Tis all bequeath'd to public <mark3>uses."--</mark3><br>
"To public use! a perfect <mark4>whim!</mark4><br>
What had the public done for <mark3>him?</mark3><br>
Mere envy, avarice, and <mark1>pride:</mark1><br>
He gave it all--but first he <mark3>died.</mark3><br>
And had the <mark4>Dean</mark4>, in all the <mark4>nation,</mark4><br>
No worthy friend, no poor <mark3>relation?</mark3><br>
So ready to do strangers <mark1>good,</mark1><br>
Forgetting his own flesh and <mark4>blood?"</mark4><br>
<br>
Now Grub-Street wits are all <mark4>employ'd;</mark4><br>
With elegies the town is <mark3>cloy'd:</mark3><br>
Some paragraph in ev'ry <mark4>paper</mark4><br>
To curse the Dean or bless the Drapier. <br>
<br>
The doctors, tender of their <mark4>fame,</mark4><br>
Wisely on me lay all the <mark3>blame:</mark3><br>
"We must confess his case was <mark4>nice;</mark4><br>
But he would never take <mark3>advice.</mark3><br>
Had he been rul'd, for aught <mark1>appears,</mark1><br>
He might have liv'd these twenty <mark1>years;</mark1><br>
For, when we open'd him, we <mark1>found</mark1><br>
That all his vital parts were <mark3>sound."</mark3><br>
<br>
From Dublin soon to London <mark4>spread,</mark4><br>
'Tis told at Court, the Dean is <mark1>dead.</mark1><br>
<br>
Kind Lady Suffolk in the <mark4>spleen</mark4><br>
Runs laughing up to tell the <mark3>Queen.</mark3><br>
The Queen, so gracious, <mark4>mild</mark4>, and <mark1>good,</mark1><br>
Cries, "Is he gone! 'tis time he <mark3>should.</mark3><br>
He's dead, you say; why, let him <mark4>rot:</mark4><br>
I'm glad the medals were <mark3>forgot.</mark3><br>
I promis'd them, I <mark4>own</mark4>, but <mark4>when?</mark4><br>
I only was the Princess <mark3>then;</mark3><br>
But now, as consort of a <mark3>king,</mark3><br>
You know, 'tis quite a different <mark1>thing."</mark1><br>
<br>
Now Chartres, at Sir Robert's <mark3>levee,</mark3><br>
Tells with a sneer the tidings <mark3>heavy:</mark3><br>
"Why, is he dead without his <mark4>shoes?"</mark4><br>
Cries Bob, "I'm sorry for the <mark3>news:</mark3><br>
O, were the wretch but living <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
And in his place my good friend <mark3>Will!</mark3><br>
Or had a mitre on his <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
Provided Bolingbroke were <mark1>dead!"</mark1><br>
<br>
Now Curll his shop from rubbish <mark4>drains:</mark4><br>
Three genuine tomes of Swift's <mark3>remains!</mark3><br>
And then, to make them pass the glibber, <br>
Revis'd by Tibbalds, Moore, and Cibber. <br>
He'll treat me as he does my <mark4>betters,</mark4><br>
Publish my will, my life, my <mark3>letters:</mark3><br>
Revive the libels born to <mark1>die;</mark1><br>
Which Pope must bear, as well as <mark1>I.</mark1><br>
<br>
Here shift the scene, to <mark4>represent</mark4><br>
How those I love my death <mark3>lament.</mark3><br>
Poor Pope will grieve a month, and <mark1>Gay</mark1><br>
A week, and Arbuthnot a <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
<br>
St. John himself will scarce <mark5>forbear</mark5><br>
To bite his pen, and drop a <mark3>tear.</mark3><br>
The rest will give a shrug, and <mark3>cry,</mark3><br>
"I'm sorry--but we all must <mark1>die!"</mark1><br>
Indifference, clad in Wisdom's <mark4>guise,</mark4><br>
All fortitude of mind <mark3>supplies:</mark3><br>
For how can stony bowels <mark4>melt</mark4><br>
In those who never pity <mark3>felt?</mark3><br>
When  we are lash'd,  they kiss the <mark4>rod,</mark4><br>
Resigning to the will of <mark3>God.</mark3><br>
<br>
The fools, my juniors by a <mark1>year,</mark1><br>
Are tortur'd with suspense and <mark1>fear;</mark1><br>
Who wisely thought my age a <mark4>screen,</mark4><br>
When death approach'd, to stand <mark3>between:</mark3><br>
The screen remov'd, their hearts are <mark4>trembling;</mark4><br>
They mourn for me without <mark3>dissembling.</mark3><br>
<br>
My female friends, whose tender <mark4>hearts</mark4><br>
Have better learn'd to act their <mark3>parts,</mark3><br>
Receive the news in doleful <mark4>dumps:</mark4><br>
"The Dean is dead: (and what is <mark3>trumps?)</mark3><br>
Then, Lord have mercy on his <mark4>soul!</mark4><br>
(Ladies, I'll venture for the vole.) <br>
Six deans, they say, must bear the <mark4>pall:</mark4><br>
(I wish I knew what king to <mark3>call.)</mark3><br>
Madam, your husband will <mark4>attend</mark4><br>
The funeral of so good a <mark1>friend.</mark1><br>
No, madam, 'tis a shocking <mark4>sight:</mark4><br>
And he's engag'd to-morrow <mark3>night:</mark3><br>
My Lady Club would take it <mark4>ill,</mark4><br>
If he should fail her at <mark5>quadrille.</mark5><br>
He lov'd the Dean--(I lead a <mark4>heart)</mark4><br>
But dearest friends, they say, must <mark3>part.</mark3><br>
His time was come: he ran his <mark1>race;</mark1><br>
We hope he's in a better <mark3>place."</mark3><br>
<br>
Why do we grieve that friends should <mark1>die?</mark1><br>
No loss more easy to <mark3>supply.</mark3><br>
One year is past; a different <mark3>scene!</mark3><br>
No further mention of the <mark3>Dean;</mark3><br>
Who now, alas! no more is <mark4>miss'd,</mark4><br>
Than if he never did <mark4>exist.</mark4><br>
Where's now this fav'rite of <mark3>Apollo!</mark3><br>
Departed:--and his works must <mark3>follow;</mark3><br>
Must undergo the common <mark4>fate;</mark4><br>
His kind of wit is out of <mark1>date.</mark1><br>
Some country squire to Lintot <mark4>goes,</mark4><br>
Inquires for "Swift in Verse and <mark1>Prose."</mark1><br>
Says Lintot, "I have heard the <mark3>name;</mark3><br>
He died a year ago."--"The <mark3>same."</mark3><br>
He searcheth all his shop in <mark4>vain.</mark4><br>
"Sir, you may find them in <mark3>Duck-lane;</mark3><br>
I sent them with a load of <mark4>books,</mark4><br>
Last Monday to the <mark3>pastry-cook's.</mark3><br>
To fancy they could live a <mark1>year!</mark1><br>
I find you're but a stranger <mark4>here.</mark4><br>
The Dean was famous in his <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
And had a kind of knack at <mark1>rhyme.</mark1><br>
His way of writing now is <mark4>past;</mark4><br>
The town hath got a better <mark4>taste;</mark4><br>
I keep no antiquated <mark3>stuff,</mark3><br>
But spick and span I have <mark3>enough.</mark3><br>
Pray do but give me leave to show <mark1>'em;</mark1><br>
Here's Colley Cibber's birth-day <mark1>poem.</mark1><br>
This ode you never yet have <mark4>seen,</mark4><br>
By Stephen Duck, upon the <mark1>Queen.</mark1><br>
Then here's a letter finely <mark4>penn'd</mark4><br>
Against the  Craftsman and his <mark1>friend:</mark1><br>
It clearly shows that all <mark4>reflection</mark4><br>
On ministers is <mark3>disaffection.</mark3><br>
Next, here's Sir Robert's <mark4>vindication,</mark4><br>
And Mr. Henley's last <mark3>oration.</mark3><br>
The hawkers have not got 'em <mark4>yet:</mark4><br>
Your honour please to buy a <mark3>set?</mark3><br>
<br>
"Here's Woolston's tracts, the twelfth <mark4>edition;</mark4><br>
'Tis read by every <mark3>politician:</mark3><br>
The country members, when in <mark4>town,</mark4><br>
To all their boroughs send them <mark3>down;</mark3><br>
You never met a thing so <mark4>smart;</mark4><br>
The courtiers have them all by <mark1>heart:</mark1><br>
Those maids of honour who can <mark1>read</mark1><br>
Are taught to use them for their <mark3>creed.</mark3><br>
The rev'rend author's good <mark4>intention</mark4><br>
Hath been rewarded with a <mark4>pension.</mark4><br>
He doth an honour to his <mark4>gown,</mark4><br>
By bravely running priestcraft <mark1>down:</mark1><br>
He shows, as sure as God's in <mark4>Gloucester,</mark4><br>
That Jesus was a grand <mark3>imposter;</mark3><br>
That all his miracles were <mark4>cheats,</mark4><br>
Perform'd as jugglers do their <mark3>feats:</mark3><br>
The church had never such a <mark4>writer;</mark4><br>
A shame he hath not got a <mark3>mitre!"</mark3><br>
<br>
Suppose me dead; and then <mark4>suppose</mark4><br>
A club assembled at the  Rose <mark3>;</mark3><br>
Where, from discourse of this and <mark4>that,</mark4><br>
I grow the subject of their <mark3>chat.</mark3><br>
And while they toss my name <mark4>about,</mark4><br>
With favour some, and some <mark1>without,</mark1><br>
One, quite indiff'rent in the <mark4>cause,</mark4><br>
My character impartial <mark3>draws:</mark3><br>
<br>
"The Dean, if we believe <mark4>report,</mark4><br>
Was never ill receiv'd at <mark3>Court.</mark3><br>
As for his works in verse and <mark1>prose</mark1><br>
I own myself no judge of <mark3>those;</mark3><br>
Nor can I tell what critics thought <mark1>'em:</mark1><br>
But this I know, all people bought <mark1>'em.</mark1><br>
As with a moral view <mark4>design'd</mark4><br>
To cure the vices of <mark1>mankind:</mark1><br>
His vein, ironically <mark4>grave,</mark4><br>
Expos'd the fool, and lash'd the <mark3>knave.</mark3><br>
To steal a hint was never <mark4>known,</mark4><br>
But what he writ was all his <mark1>own.</mark1><br>
<br>
"He never thought an honour done <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
Because a duke was proud to own <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
Would rather slip aside and <mark4>choose</mark4><br>
To talk with wits in dirty <mark1>shoes;</mark1><br>
Despis'd the fools with stars and <mark4>garters,</mark4><br>
So often seen caressing <mark4>Chartres.</mark4><br>
He never courted men in <mark1>station,</mark1><br>
Nor persons held in <mark3>admiration;</mark3><br>
Of no man's greatness was <mark4>afraid,</mark4><br>
Because he sought for no man's <mark3>aid.</mark3><br>
Though trusted long in great <mark4>affairs</mark4><br>
He gave himself no haughty <mark3>airs:</mark3><br>
Without regarding private <mark1>ends,</mark1><br>
Spent all his credit for his <mark1>friends;</mark1><br>
And only chose the wise and <mark1>good;</mark1><br>
No flatt'rers; no allies in <mark1>blood:</mark1><br>
But succour'd virtue in <mark4>distress,</mark4><br>
And seldom fail'd of good <mark3>success;</mark3><br>
As numbers in their hearts must <mark1>own,</mark1><br>
Who, but for him, had been <mark3>unknown.</mark3><br>
<br>
"With princes kept a due <mark4>decorum,</mark4><br>
But never stood in awe before <mark1>'em.</mark1><br>
He follow'd David's lesson <mark4>just:</mark4><br>
'In princes never put thy <mark3>trust';</mark3><br>
And, would you make him truly <mark4>sour,</mark4><br>
Provoke him with a slave in <mark4>pow'r.</mark4><br>
The Irish senate if you <mark4>nam'd,</mark4><br>
With what impatience he <mark4>declaim'd!</mark4><br>
Fair Liberty was all his <mark1>cry,</mark1><br>
For her he stood prepar'd to <mark1>die;</mark1><br>
For her he boldly stood <mark3>alone;</mark3><br>
For her he oft expos'd his <mark1>own.</mark1><br>
Two kingdoms, just as faction <mark4>led,</mark4><br>
Had set a price upon his <mark1>head;</mark1><br>
But not a traitor could be <mark1>found</mark1><br>
To sell him for six hundred <mark3>pound.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Had he but spar'd his tongue and <mark1>pen</mark1><br>
He might have rose like other <mark1>men:</mark1><br>
But pow'r was never in his <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
And wealth he valu'd not a <mark4>groat:</mark4><br>
Ingratitude he often <mark1>found,</mark1><br>
And pity'd those who meant the <mark3>wound:</mark3><br>
But kept the tenor of his <mark1>mind,</mark1><br>
To merit well of human <mark3>kind:</mark3><br>
Nor made a sacrifice of <mark1>those</mark1><br>
Who still were true, to please his <mark3>foes.</mark3><br>
He labour'd many a fruitless <mark3>hour</mark3><br>
To reconcile his friends in <mark1>pow'r;</mark1><br>
Saw mischief by a faction <mark4>brewing,</mark4><br>
While they pursu'd each other's <mark4>ruin.</mark4><br>
But, finding vain was all his <mark4>care,</mark4><br>
He left the Court in mere <mark3>despair.</mark3><br>
<br>
"And, oh! how short are human <mark4>schemes!</mark4><br>
Here ended all our golden <mark3>dreams.</mark3><br>
What St. John's skill in state <mark1>affairs,</mark1><br>
What Ormond's valour, Oxford's <mark3>cares,</mark3><br>
To save their sinking country <mark4>lent,</mark4><br>
Was all destroy'd by one <mark3>event.</mark3><br>
Too soon that precious life was <mark4>ended,</mark4><br>
On which alone our weal <mark3>depended.</mark3><br>
When up a dangerous faction <mark4>starts,</mark4><br>
With wrath and vengeance in their <mark1>hearts;</mark1><br>
By solemn League and Cov'nant <mark4>bound,</mark4><br>
To ruin, slaughter, and <mark3>confound;</mark3><br>
To turn religion to a <mark4>fable,</mark4><br>
And make the government a <mark4>Babel;</mark4><br>
Pervert the law, disgrace the <mark1>gown,</mark1><br>
Corrupt the senate, rob the <mark3>crown;</mark3><br>
To sacrifice old England's <mark4>glory,</mark4><br>
And make her infamous in <mark3>story:</mark3><br>
When such a tempest shook the <mark4>land,</mark4><br>
How could unguarded Virtue <mark3>stand?</mark3><br>
<br>
"With horror, grief, despair, the <mark1>Dean</mark1><br>
Beheld the dire destructive <mark1>scene:</mark1><br>
His friends in exile, or the <mark3>tower,</mark3><br>
Himself within the frown of <mark3>power,</mark3><br>
Pursu'd by base envenom'd <mark4>pens,</mark4><br>
Far to the land of slaves and fens; <br>
A servile race in folly nurs'd, <br>
Who truckle most when treated <mark1>worst.</mark1><br>
<br>
"By innocence and <mark4>resolution,</mark4><br>
He bore continual <mark3>persecution,</mark3><br>
While numbers to preferment <mark1>rose,</mark1><br>
Whose merits were, to be his <mark1>foes;</mark1><br>
When ev'n his own familiar <mark1>friends,</mark1><br>
Intent upon their private <mark1>ends,</mark1><br>
Like renegadoes now he <mark4>feels,</mark4><br>
Against him lifting up their <mark3>heels.</mark3><br>
<br>
"The Dean did by his pen <mark4>defeat</mark4><br>
An infamous destructive <mark3>cheat;</mark3><br>
Taught fools their int'rest how to <mark3>know,</mark3><br>
And gave them arms to ward the <mark3>blow.</mark3><br>
Envy hath own'd it was his <mark3>doing,</mark3><br>
To save that helpless land from <mark1>ruin;</mark1><br>
While they who at the steerage <mark4>stood,</mark4><br>
And reap'd the profit, sought his <mark1>blood.</mark1><br>
<br>
"To save them from their evil <mark1>fate,</mark1><br>
In him was held a crime of <mark1>state.</mark1><br>
A wicked monster on the <mark3>bench,</mark3><br>
Whose fury blood could never <mark3>quench,</mark3><br>
As vile and profligate a <mark4>villain,</mark4><br>
As modern Scroggs, or old Tresilian, <br>
Who long all justice had <mark4>discarded,</mark4><br>
Nor fear'd he <mark4>God</mark4>, nor man <mark3>regarded,</mark3><br>
Vow'd on the Dean his rage to <mark4>vent,</mark4><br>
And make him of his zeal <mark3>repent;</mark3><br>
But Heav'n his innocence <mark4>defends,</mark4><br>
The grateful people stand his <mark1>friends.</mark1><br>
Not strains of law, nor judge's <mark4>frown,</mark4><br>
Nor topics brought to please the <mark1>crown,</mark1><br>
Nor witness hir'd, nor jury <mark4>pick'd,</mark4><br>
Prevail to bring him in <mark4>convict.</mark4><br>
<br>
"In exile, with a steady <mark1>heart,</mark1><br>
He spent his life's declining <mark1>part;</mark1><br>
Where folly, pride, and faction <mark3>sway,</mark3><br>
Remote from St. John, Pope, and <mark1>Gay.</mark1><br>
<br>
"His friendships there, to few <mark5>confin'd,</mark5><br>
Were always of the middling <mark1>kind;</mark1><br>
No fools of rank, a mongrel <mark4>breed,</mark4><br>
Who fain would pass for lords <mark3>indeed:</mark3><br>
Where titles gave no right or <mark1>power</mark1><br>
And peerage is a wither'd <mark3>flower;</mark3><br>
He would have held it a <mark4>disgrace,</mark4><br>
If such a wretch had known his <mark1>face.</mark1><br>
On rural squires, that kingdom's <mark4>bane,</mark4><br>
He vented oft his wrath in <mark1>vain;</mark1><br>
Biennial squires to market <mark4>brought;</mark4><br>
Who sell their souls and votes for nought; <br>
The nation stripp'd, go joyful <mark4>back,</mark4><br>
To rob the church, their tenants <mark3>rack,</mark3><br>
Go snacks with thieves and rapparees, <br>
And keep the peace to pick up <mark4>fees;</mark4><br>
In ev'ry job to have a <mark3>share,</mark3><br>
A jail or barrack to <mark3>repair;</mark3><br>
And turn the tax for public <mark4>roads,</mark4><br>
Commodious to their own <mark5>abodes.</mark5><br>
<br>
"Perhaps I may allow, the <mark1>Dean</mark1><br>
Had too much satire in his <mark4>vein;</mark4><br>
And seem'd determin'd not to starve <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
Because no age could more deserve <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
Yet malice never was his <mark4>aim;</mark4><br>
He lash'd the vice, but spar'd the <mark1>name;</mark1><br>
No individual could <mark4>resent,</mark4><br>
Where thousands equally were <mark3>meant.</mark3><br>
His satire points at no <mark4>defect,</mark4><br>
But what all mortals may <mark3>correct;</mark3><br>
For he abhorr'd that senseless <mark3>tribe</mark3><br>
Who call it humour when they <mark3>gibe.</mark3><br>
He spar'd a hump, or crooked <mark4>nose,</mark4><br>
Whose owners set not up for <mark3>beaux.</mark3><br>
True genuine dulness mov'd his <mark4>pity,</mark4><br>
Unless it offer'd to be <mark3>witty.</mark3><br>
Those who their ignorance <mark4>confess'd</mark4><br>
He ne'er offended with a <mark4>jest;</mark4><br>
But laugh'd to hear an idiot <mark4>quote</mark4><br>
A verse from Horace, learn'd by <mark3>rote.</mark3><br>
<br>
"He knew a hundred pleasant <mark4>stories</mark4><br>
With all the turns of Whigs and <mark4>Tories:</mark4><br>
Was cheerful to his dying <mark1>day;</mark1><br>
And friends would let him have his <mark1>way.</mark1><br>
<br>
"He gave the little wealth he <mark4>had</mark4><br>
To build a house for fools and <mark3>mad;</mark3><br>
And show'd by one satiric <mark4>touch,</mark4><br>
No nation wanted it so <mark3>much.</mark3><br>
That kingdom he hath left his <mark4>debtor,</mark4><br>
I wish it soon may have a <mark3>better."</mark3><br>
