Title : Chaucer <br>
Author : Henry Wadsworth Longfellow <br><br>

An old man in a lodge within a <mark3>park;</mark3><br>
The chamber walls depicted all <mark3>around</mark3><br>
With portraitures of huntsman, hawk, and <mark3>hound,</mark3><br>
And the hurt deer. He listeneth to the <mark3>lark,</mark3><br>
Whose song comes with the sunshine through the <mark3>dark</mark3><br>
Of painted glass in leaden lattice <mark3>bound;</mark3><br>
He listeneth and he laugheth at the <mark3>sound,</mark3><br>
Then writeth in a book like any <mark4>clerk.</mark4><br>
He is the poet of the dawn, who <mark3>wrote</mark3><br>
The Canterbury Tales, and his old <mark3>age</mark3><br>
Made beautiful with song; and as I <mark4>read</mark4><br>
I hear the crowing cock, I hear the <mark3>note</mark3><br>
Of lark and linnet, and from every <mark3>page</mark3><br>
Rise odors of ploughed field or flowery <mark3>mead.</mark3><br>
