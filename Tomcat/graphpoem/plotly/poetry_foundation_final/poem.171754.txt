Title : From Blossoms <br>
Author : Li-Young Lee <br><br>

From blossoms <mark4>comes</mark4><br>
this brown paper bag of <mark4>peaches</mark4><br>
we bought from the <mark3>boy</mark3><br>
at the bend in the road where we turned <mark4>toward</mark4><br>
signs painted <mark1>Peaches.</mark1><br>
<br>
From laden <mark4>boughs</mark4>, from <mark4>hands,</mark4><br>
from sweet fellowship in the <mark4>bins,</mark4><br>
comes nectar at the roadside, <mark4>succulent</mark4><br>
peaches we devour, dusty skin and all, <br>
comes the familiar dust of summer, dust we <mark4>eat.</mark4><br>
<br>
O, to take what we love <mark4>inside,</mark4><br>
to carry within us an orchard, to <mark1>eat</mark1><br>
not only the skin, but the <mark4>shade,</mark4><br>
not only the sugar, but the days, to <mark4>hold</mark4><br>
the fruit in our hands, adore it, then bite <mark3>into</mark3><br>
the round jubilance of <mark5>peach.</mark5><br>
<br>
There are days we live <br>
as if death were nowhere <br>
in the background; from <mark3>joy</mark3><br>
to joy to joy, from wing to wing, <br>
from blossom to blossom <mark3>to</mark3><br>
impossible <mark1>blossom</mark1>, to sweet impossible <mark1>blossom.</mark1><br>
