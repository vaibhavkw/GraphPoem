Title : The Lifeguard <br>
Author : James L. Dickey <br><br>

In a stable of boats I lie <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
From all sleeping children <mark4>hidden.</mark4><br>
The leap of a fish from its shadow   <br>
Makes the whole lake instantly <mark4>tremble.</mark4><br>
With my foot on the water, I <mark4>feel</mark4><br>
The moon <mark4>outside</mark4><br>
<br>
Take on the utmost of its <mark4>power.</mark4><br>
I rise and go out through the <mark4>boats.</mark4><br>
I set my broad sole upon <mark4>silver,</mark4><br>
On the skin of the sky, on the <mark4>moonlight,</mark4><br>
Stepping outward from earth onto <mark4>water</mark4><br>
In quest of the <mark4>miracle</mark4><br>
<br>
This village of children <mark4>believed</mark4><br>
That I could perform as I <mark4>dived</mark4><br>
For one who had sunk from my <mark4>sight.</mark4><br>
I saw his cropped haircut go <mark4>under.</mark4><br>
I <mark4>leapt</mark4>, and my steep body <mark4>flashed</mark4><br>
Once, in the <mark4>sun.</mark4><br>
<br>
Dark drew all the light from my <mark4>eyes.</mark4><br>
Like a man who explores his death <br>
By the pull of his slow-moving <mark4>shoulders,</mark4><br>
I hung head down in the <mark4>cold,</mark4><br>
Wide-eyed, contained, and <mark4>alone</mark4><br>
Among the <mark4>weeds,</mark4><br>
<br>
And my fingertips turned into <mark3>stone</mark3><br>
From clutching immovable <mark4>blackness.</mark4><br>
Time after time I leapt <mark4>upward</mark4><br>
Exploding in breath, and fell <mark1>back</mark1><br>
From the change in the children's <mark4>faces</mark4><br>
At my <mark4>defeat.</mark4><br>
<br>
Beneath them I swam to the <mark4>boathouse</mark4><br>
With only my life in my <mark4>arms</mark4><br>
To wait for the lake to shine <mark1>back</mark1><br>
At the risen moon with such <mark1>power</mark1><br>
That my steps on the light of the <mark4>ripples</mark4><br>
Might be <mark4>sustained.</mark4><br>
<br>
Beneath me is nothing but <mark4>brightness</mark4><br>
Like the ghost of a snowfield in <mark4>summer.</mark4><br>
As I move toward the center of the <mark4>lake,</mark4><br>
Which is also the center of the <mark4>moon,</mark4><br>
I am thinking of how I may <mark3>be</mark3><br>
The savior of <mark4>one</mark4><br>
<br>
Who has already died in my care.   <br>
The dark trees fade from around <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
The moon's dust hovers <mark4>together.</mark4><br>
I call softly out, and the <mark4>child's</mark4><br>
Voice answers through blinding <mark1>water.</mark1><br>
<mark4>Patiently</mark4>, <mark4>slowly,</mark4><br>
<br>
He rises, dilating to <mark3>break</mark3><br>
The surface of stone with his <mark4>forehead.</mark4><br>
He is one I do not <mark4>remember</mark4><br>
Having ever seen in his life. <br>
The ground I stand on is <mark5>trembling</mark5><br>
Upon his <mark4>smile.</mark4><br>
<br>
I wash the black mud from my <mark4>hands.</mark4><br>
On a light given off by the grave   <br>
I kneel in the quick of the <mark1>moon</mark1><br>
At the heart of a distant <mark4>forest</mark4><br>
And hold in my arms a <mark4>child</mark4><br>
Of <mark1>water</mark1>, water, <mark1>water.</mark1><br>
