Title : To her Sister Mistress A. B. <br>
Author : Isabella Whitney <br><br>

Because I to my brethern <mark4>wrote</mark4><br>
and to my sisters <mark3>two:</mark3><br>
Good sister Anne, you this might wote,<br>
if so I should not <mark3>do</mark3><br>
To you, or ere I parted <mark4>hence,</mark4><br>
You vainly had bestowed expence.<br>
<br>
Yet is it not for that I <mark4>write,</mark4><br>
for nature did you <mark3>bind</mark3><br>
To do me good, and to <mark5>requite</mark5><br>
hath nature me <mark3>inclined:</mark3><br>
Wherefore good sister take in gree<br>
These simple lines that come from <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
<br>
Wherein I wish you Nestor's <mark4>days,</mark4><br>
in happy health to <mark4>rest:</mark4><br>
With such success in all assays<br>
as those which God hath <mark3>blest:</mark3><br>
Your husband with your pretty <mark4>boys,</mark4><br>
God keep them free from all <mark3>annoys.</mark3><br>
<br>
And grant if that my luck it <mark3>be</mark3><br>
to linger here so <mark3>long</mark3><br>
Till they be men, that I may <mark3>see</mark3><br>
for learning them so <mark3>strong</mark3><br>
That they may march amongst the <mark3>best</mark3><br>
Of them which learning have possest.<br>
<br>
By that time will my aged <mark4>years</mark4><br>
perhaps a staff <mark5>require:</mark5><br>
And quakingly as still in <mark3>fears</mark3><br>
my limbs draw to the <mark3>fire:</mark3><br>
Yet joy I shall them so to <mark1>see,</mark1><br>
If any joy in age there <mark1>be.</mark1><br>
<br>
Good sister so I you <mark4>commend</mark4><br>
to him that made us <mark3>all:</mark3><br>
I know you huswifery <mark3>intend,</mark3><br>
though I to writing <mark3>fall:</mark3><br>
Wherefore no lenger shall you <mark3>stay</mark3><br>
From business that profit <mark3>may.</mark3><br>
<br>
Had I a husband, or a <mark4>house,</mark4><br>
        and all that longs thereto,<br>
My self could frame about to <mark3>rouse,</mark3><br>
as other women <mark1>do:</mark1><br>
But till some household cares me <mark3>tie,</mark3><br>
My books and pen I will <mark3>apply.</mark3><br>
