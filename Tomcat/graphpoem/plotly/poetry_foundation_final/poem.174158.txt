Title : Eloisa to Abelard <br>
Author : Alexander Pope <br><br>

In these deep solitudes and awful <mark3>cells,</mark3><br>
Where heav'nly-pensive contemplation <mark3>dwells,</mark3><br>
And ever-musing melancholy <mark4>reigns;</mark4><br>
What means this tumult in a vestal's <mark3>veins?</mark3><br>
Why rove my thoughts beyond this last <mark3>retreat?</mark3><br>
Why feels my heart its long-forgotten <mark3>heat?</mark3><br>
Yet, yet I love!?From Abelard it <mark3>came,</mark3><br>
And Eloisa yet must kiss the <mark3>name.</mark3><br>
<br>
         Dear fatal name! rest ever unreveal'd,<br>
Nor pass these lips in holy silence <mark4>seal'd.</mark4><br>
Hide it, my heart, within that close <mark4>disguise,</mark4><br>
Where mix'd with <mark4>God's</mark4>, his lov'd idea <mark3>lies:</mark3><br>
O write it not, my hand?the name <mark4>appears</mark4><br>
Already written?wash it out, my <mark3>tears!</mark3><br>
In vain lost Eloisa weeps and <mark4>prays,</mark4><br>
Her heart still dictates, and her hand <mark3>obeys.</mark3><br>
<br>
Relentless walls! whose darksome round <mark4>contains</mark4><br>
Repentant <mark4>sighs</mark4>, and voluntary <mark3>pains:</mark3><br>
Ye rugged rocks! which holy knees have <mark3>worn;</mark3><br>
Ye grots and caverns shagg'd with horrid <mark3>thorn!</mark3><br>
Shrines! where their vigils pale-ey'd virgins <mark3>keep,</mark3><br>
And pitying saints, whose statues learn to <mark3>weep!</mark3><br>
Though cold like you, unmov'd, and silent <mark4>grown,</mark4><br>
I have not yet forgot myself to <mark3>stone.</mark3><br>
All is not Heav'n's while Abelard has <mark4>part,</mark4><br>
Still rebel nature holds out half my <mark3>heart;</mark3><br>
Nor pray'rs nor fasts its stubborn pulse <mark4>restrain,</mark4><br>
Nor tears, for ages, taught to flow in <mark3>vain.</mark3><br>
<br>
         Soon as thy letters trembling I unclose,<br>
That well-known name awakens all my <mark4>woes.</mark4><br>
Oh name for ever sad! for ever <mark3>dear!</mark3><br>
Still breath'd in sighs, still usher'd with a <mark3>tear.</mark3><br>
I tremble too, where'er my own I <mark3>find,</mark3><br>
Some dire misfortune follows close <mark3>behind.</mark3><br>
Line after line my gushing eyes <mark3>o'erflow,</mark3><br>
Led through a sad variety of <mark5>woe:</mark5><br>
Now warm in love, now with'ring in thy <mark4>bloom,</mark4><br>
Lost in a convent's solitary <mark3>gloom!</mark3><br>
There stern religion quench'd th' unwilling <mark4>flame,</mark4><br>
There died the best of passions, love and <mark3>fame.</mark3><br>
<br>
Yet write, oh write me all, that I may <mark4>join</mark4><br>
Griefs to thy griefs, and echo sighs to <mark4>thine.</mark4><br>
Nor foes nor fortune take this pow'r <mark3>away;</mark3><br>
And is my Abelard less kind than <mark3>they?</mark3><br>
Tears still are mine, and those I need not <mark3>spare,</mark3><br>
Love but demands what else were shed in <mark4>pray'r;</mark4><br>
No happier task these faded eyes <mark3>pursue;</mark3><br>
To read and weep is all they now can <mark3>do.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then share thy pain, allow that sad <mark3>relief;</mark3><br>
Ah, more than share it! give me all thy <mark3>grief.</mark3><br>
Heav'n first taught letters for some wretch's <mark4>aid,</mark4><br>
Some banish'd lover, or some captive <mark3>maid;</mark3><br>
They live, they speak, they breathe what love <mark4>inspires,</mark4><br>
Warm from the soul, and faithful to its <mark3>fires,</mark3><br>
The virgin's wish without her fears <mark3>impart,</mark3><br>
Excuse the blush, and pour out all the <mark1>heart,</mark1><br>
Speed the soft intercourse from soul to <mark3>soul,</mark3><br>
And waft a sigh from Indus to the <mark3>Pole.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thou know'st how guiltless first I met thy <mark1>flame,</mark1><br>
When Love approach'd me under Friendship's <mark1>name;</mark1><br>
My fancy form'd thee of angelic <mark4>kind,</mark4><br>
Some emanation of th' all-beauteous <mark3>Mind.</mark3><br>
Those smiling eyes, attemp'ring ev'ry <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
Shone sweetly lambent with celestial <mark1>day.</mark1><br>
Guiltless I gaz'd; heav'n listen'd while you <mark3>sung;</mark3><br>
And truths divine came mended from that <mark3>tongue.</mark3><br>
From lips like those what precept fail'd to <mark4>move?</mark4><br>
Too soon they taught me 'twas no sin to <mark4>love.</mark4><br>
Back through the paths of pleasing sense I <mark4>ran,</mark4><br>
Nor wish'd an Angel whom I lov'd a <mark3>Man.</mark3><br>
Dim and remote the joys of saints I <mark3>see;</mark3><br>
Nor envy them, that heav'n I lose for <mark3>thee.</mark3><br>
<br>
How oft, when press'd to marriage, have I <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
Curse on all laws but those which love has <mark4>made!</mark4><br>
Love, free as air, at sight of human <mark4>ties,</mark4><br>
Spreads his light <mark4>wings</mark4>, and in a moment <mark3>flies,</mark3><br>
Let wealth, let honour, wait the wedded <mark3>dame,</mark3><br>
August her deed, and sacred be her <mark1>fame;</mark1><br>
Before true passion all those views <mark4>remove,</mark4><br>
Fame, wealth, and honour! what are you to <mark1>Love?</mark1><br>
The jealous God, when we profane his <mark1>fires,</mark1><br>
Those restless passions in revenge <mark1>inspires;</mark1><br>
And bids them make mistaken mortals <mark4>groan,</mark4><br>
Who seek in love for aught but love <mark3>alone.</mark3><br>
Should at my feet the world's great master <mark4>fall,</mark4><br>
Himself, his throne, his world, I'd scorn 'em <mark3>all:</mark3><br>
Not Caesar's empress would I deign to <mark4>prove;</mark4><br>
No, make me mistress to the man I <mark1>love;</mark1><br>
If there be yet another name more <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
More fond than mistress, make me that to <mark1>thee!</mark1><br>
Oh happy state! when souls each other <mark3>draw,</mark3><br>
When love is liberty, and nature, <mark3>law:</mark3><br>
All then is full, possessing, and <mark4>possess'd,</mark4><br>
No craving void left aching in the <mark4>breast:</mark4><br>
Ev'n thought meets <mark4>thought</mark4>, ere from the lips it <mark1>part,</mark1><br>
And each warm wish springs mutual from the <mark1>heart.</mark1><br>
This sure is bliss (if bliss on earth there <mark3>be)</mark3><br>
And once the lot of Abelard and <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
<br>
Alas, how chang'd! what sudden horrors <mark4>rise!</mark4><br>
A naked lover bound and bleeding <mark1>lies!</mark1><br>
Where, where was Eloise? her voice, her <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
Her poniard, had oppos'd the dire <mark3>command.</mark3><br>
<mark4>Barbarian</mark4>, stay! that bloody stroke <mark1>restrain;</mark1><br>
The crime was <mark4>common</mark4>, common be the <mark3>pain.</mark3><br>
I can no more; by shame, by rage <mark4>suppress'd,</mark4><br>
Let tears, and burning blushes speak the <mark4>rest.</mark4><br>
<br>
Canst thou forget that sad, that solemn <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
When victims at yon altar's foot we <mark3>lay?</mark3><br>
Canst thou forget what tears that moment <mark4>fell,</mark4><br>
When, warm in youth, I bade the world <mark3>farewell?</mark3><br>
As with cold lips I kiss'd the sacred <mark4>veil,</mark4><br>
The shrines all trembl'd, and the lamps grew <mark3>pale:</mark3><br>
Heav'n scarce believ'd the conquest it <mark4>survey'd,</mark4><br>
And saints with wonder heard the vows I <mark1>made.</mark1><br>
Yet then, to those dread altars as I <mark3>drew,</mark3><br>
Not on the Cross my eyes were fix'd, but <mark3>you:</mark3><br>
Not grace, or <mark4>zeal</mark4>, love only was my <mark4>call,</mark4><br>
And if I lose thy love, I lose my <mark1>all.</mark1><br>
Come! with thy looks, thy words, relieve my <mark1>woe;</mark1><br>
Those still at least are left thee to <mark3>bestow.</mark3><br>
Still on that breast enamour'd let me <mark5>lie,</mark5><br>
Still drink delicious poison from thy <mark3>eye,</mark3><br>
Pant on thy lip, and to thy heart be <mark4>press'd;</mark4><br>
Give all thou canst?and let me dream the <mark1>rest.</mark1><br>
Ah no! instruct me other joys to <mark4>prize,</mark4><br>
With other beauties charm my partial <mark3>eyes,</mark3><br>
Full in my view set all the bright <mark4>abode,</mark4><br>
And make my soul quit Abelard for <mark4>God.</mark4><br>
<br>
Ah, think at least thy flock deserves thy <mark3>care,</mark3><br>
Plants of thy hand, and children of thy <mark1>pray'r.</mark1><br>
From the false world in early youth they <mark4>fled,</mark4><br>
By thee to mountains, wilds, and deserts <mark3>led.</mark3><br>
You rais'd these hallow'd walls; the desert smil'd,<br>
And Paradise was open'd in the <mark4>wild.</mark4><br>
No weeping orphan saw his father's <mark4>stores</mark4><br>
Our shrines irradiate, or emblaze the <mark3>floors;</mark3><br>
No silver saints, by dying misers giv'n,<br>
Here brib'd the rage of ill-requited <mark5>heav'n:</mark5><br>
But such plain roofs as piety could <mark4>raise,</mark4><br>
And only vocal with the Maker's <mark3>praise.</mark3><br>
In these lone walls (their days eternal <mark4>bound)</mark4><br>
These moss-grown domes with spiry turrets <mark4>crown'd,</mark4><br>
Where awful arches make a noonday <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
And the dim windows shed a solemn <mark3>light;</mark3><br>
Thy eyes diffus'd a reconciling <mark3>ray,</mark3><br>
And gleams of glory brighten'd all the <mark1>day.</mark1><br>
But now no face divine contentment <mark4>wears,</mark4><br>
'Tis all blank sadness, or continual <mark1>tears.</mark1><br>
See how the force of others' pray'rs I <mark3>try,</mark3><br>
(O pious fraud of am'rous <mark4>charity!)</mark4><br>
But why should I on others' pray'rs <mark4>depend?</mark4><br>
Come thou, my father, brother, <mark4>husband</mark4>, <mark3>friend!</mark3><br>
Ah let thy handmaid, sister, daughter <mark1>move,</mark1><br>
And all those tender names in one, thy <mark1>love!</mark1><br>
The darksome pines that o'er yon rocks reclin'd<br>
Wave high, and murmur to the hollow <mark4>wind,</mark4><br>
The wand'ring streams that shine between the <mark4>hills,</mark4><br>
The grots that echo to the tinkling rills,<br>
The dying gales that pant upon the <mark4>trees,</mark4><br>
The lakes that quiver to the curling <mark3>breeze;</mark3><br>
No more these scenes my meditation <mark1>aid,</mark1><br>
Or lull to rest the visionary <mark1>maid.</mark1><br>
But o'er the twilight groves and dusky <mark4>caves,</mark4><br>
Long-sounding <mark4>aisles</mark4>, and intermingled <mark3>graves,</mark3><br>
Black Melancholy sits, and round her <mark4>throws</mark4><br>
A death-like silence, and a dread <mark3>repose:</mark3><br>
Her gloomy presence saddens all the <mark4>scene,</mark4><br>
Shades ev'ry flow'r, and darkens ev'ry <mark3>green,</mark3><br>
Deepens the murmur of the falling <mark4>floods,</mark4><br>
And breathes a browner horror on the <mark4>woods.</mark4><br>
<br>
Yet here for ever, ever must I <mark3>stay;</mark3><br>
Sad proof how well a lover can <mark3>obey!</mark3><br>
Death, only death, can break the lasting <mark4>chain;</mark4><br>
And here, ev'n <mark4>then</mark4>, shall my cold dust <mark3>remain,</mark3><br>
Here all its frailties, all its flames <mark4>resign,</mark4><br>
And wait till 'tis no sin to mix with <mark1>thine.</mark1><br>
<br>
Ah wretch! believ'd the spouse of God in <mark1>vain,</mark1><br>
Confess'd within the slave of love and <mark1>man.</mark1><br>
Assist me, Heav'n! but whence arose that <mark1>pray'r?</mark1><br>
Sprung it from piety, or from <mark3>despair?</mark3><br>
Ev'n here, where frozen chastity <mark4>retires,</mark4><br>
Love finds an altar for forbidden <mark1>fires.</mark1><br>
I ought to grieve, but cannot what I <mark4>ought;</mark4><br>
I mourn the lover, not lament the <mark4>fault;</mark4><br>
I view my crime, but kindle at the <mark3>view,</mark3><br>
Repent old pleasures, and solicit <mark3>new;</mark3><br>
Now turn'd to Heav'n, I weep my past <mark1>offence,</mark1><br>
Now think of thee, and curse my <mark4>innocence.</mark4><br>
Of all affliction taught a lover <mark4>yet,</mark4><br>
'Tis sure the hardest science to <mark3>forget!</mark3><br>
How shall I lose the sin, yet keep the <mark4>sense,</mark4><br>
And love th' offender, yet detest th' <mark1>offence?</mark1><br>
How the dear object from the crime <mark1>remove,</mark1><br>
Or how distinguish penitence from <mark1>love?</mark1><br>
Unequal task! a passion to <mark1>resign,</mark1><br>
For hearts so touch'd, so pierc'd, so lost as <mark3>mine.</mark3><br>
Ere such a soul regains its peaceful <mark4>state,</mark4><br>
How often must it love, how often <mark3>hate!</mark3><br>
How often hope, despair, <mark4>resent</mark4>, <mark4>regret,</mark4><br>
Conceal, disdain?do all things but <mark1>forget.</mark1><br>
But let Heav'n seize it, all at once 'tis <mark4>fir'd;</mark4><br>
Not touch'd, but rapt; not waken'd, but <mark5>inspir'd!</mark5><br>
Oh come! oh teach me nature to <mark3>subdue,</mark3><br>
Renounce my love, my life, myself?and <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
Fill my fond heart with God alone, for <mark3>he</mark3><br>
Alone can rival, can succeed to <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
<br>
How happy is the blameless vestal's <mark4>lot!</mark4><br>
The world forgetting, by the world <mark3>forgot.</mark3><br>
Eternal sunshine of the spotless <mark1>mind!</mark1><br>
Each pray'r accepted, and each wish <mark4>resign'd;</mark4><br>
Labour and rest, that equal periods <mark1>keep;</mark1><br>
"Obedient slumbers that can wake and <mark1>weep;"</mark1><br>
Desires compos'd, affections ever <mark4>ev'n,</mark4><br>
Tears that delight, and sighs that waft to <mark1>Heav'n.</mark1><br>
Grace shines around her with serenest <mark4>beams,</mark4><br>
And whisp'ring angels prompt her golden <mark3>dreams.</mark3><br>
For her th' unfading rose of Eden <mark4>blooms,</mark4><br>
And wings of seraphs shed divine <mark3>perfumes,</mark3><br>
For her the Spouse prepares the bridal <mark4>ring,</mark4><br>
For her white virgins hymeneals <mark3>sing,</mark3><br>
To sounds of heav'nly harps she dies <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
And melts in visions of eternal <mark1>day.</mark1><br>
<br>
Far other dreams my erring soul <mark3>employ,</mark3><br>
Far other raptures, of unholy <mark3>joy:</mark3><br>
When at the close of each sad, sorrowing <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
Fancy restores what vengeance snatch'd <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
Then conscience sleeps, and leaving nature <mark1>free,</mark1><br>
All my loose soul unbounded springs to <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
Oh curs'd, dear horrors of all-conscious <mark1>night!</mark1><br>
How glowing guilt exalts the keen <mark3>delight!</mark3><br>
Provoking Daemons all restraint <mark1>remove,</mark1><br>
And stir within me every source of <mark1>love.</mark1><br>
I hear thee, view thee, gaze o'er all thy <mark4>charms,</mark4><br>
And round thy phantom glue my clasping <mark3>arms.</mark3><br>
I wake?no more I hear, no more I <mark1>view,</mark1><br>
The phantom flies me, as unkind as <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
I call aloud; it hears not what I <mark3>say;</mark3><br>
I stretch my empty arms; it glides <mark1>away.</mark1><br>
To dream once more I close my willing <mark1>eyes;</mark1><br>
Ye soft illusions, dear deceits, <mark3>arise!</mark3><br>
Alas, no more?methinks we wand'ring <mark3>go</mark3><br>
Through dreary wastes, and weep each other's <mark1>woe,</mark1><br>
Where round some mould'ring tower pale ivy <mark4>creeps,</mark4><br>
And low-brow'd rocks hang nodding o'er the deeps.<br>
Sudden you mount, you beckon from the <mark3>skies;</mark3><br>
Clouds interpose, waves roar, and winds <mark1>arise.</mark1><br>
I shriek, start up, the same sad prospect <mark1>find,</mark1><br>
And wake to all the griefs I left <mark1>behind.</mark1><br>
<br>
For thee the fates, severely kind, <mark4>ordain</mark4><br>
A cool suspense from pleasure and from <mark1>pain;</mark1><br>
Thy life a long, dead calm of fix'd <mark1>repose;</mark1><br>
No pulse that riots, and no blood that <mark3>glows.</mark3><br>
Still as the sea, ere winds were taught to <mark3>blow,</mark3><br>
Or moving spirit bade the waters <mark3>flow;</mark3><br>
Soft as the slumbers of a saint <mark5>forgiv'n,</mark5><br>
And mild as opening gleams of promis'd <mark1>heav'n.</mark1><br>
<br>
Come, Abelard! for what hast thou to <mark4>dread?</mark4><br>
The torch of Venus burns not for the <mark3>dead.</mark3><br>
Nature stands <mark4>check'd</mark4>, Religion <mark4>disapproves;</mark4><br>
Ev'n thou art cold?yet Eloisa <mark4>loves.</mark4><br>
Ah hopeless, lasting flames! like those that <mark4>burn</mark4><br>
To light the dead, and warm th' unfruitful <mark3>urn.</mark3><br>
<br>
What scenes appear where'er I turn my <mark1>view?</mark1><br>
The dear ideas, where I fly, <mark1>pursue,</mark1><br>
Rise in the grove, before the altar <mark1>rise,</mark1><br>
Stain all my soul, and wanton in my <mark1>eyes.</mark1><br>
I waste the matin lamp in sighs for <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
Thy image steals between my God and <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Thy voice I seem in ev'ry hymn to <mark4>hear,</mark4><br>
With ev'ry bead I drop too soft a <mark1>tear.</mark1><br>
When from the censer clouds of fragrance <mark4>roll,</mark4><br>
And swelling organs lift the rising <mark1>soul,</mark1><br>
One thought of thee puts all the pomp to <mark3>flight,</mark3><br>
Priests, tapers, temples, swim before my <mark3>sight:</mark3><br>
In seas of flame my plunging soul is <mark4>drown'd,</mark4><br>
While altars blaze, and angels tremble <mark4>round.</mark4><br>
<br>
While prostrate here in humble grief I <mark1>lie,</mark1><br>
Kind, virtuous drops just gath'ring in my <mark1>eye,</mark1><br>
While praying, trembling, in the dust I <mark1>roll,</mark1><br>
And dawning grace is op'ning on my <mark1>soul:</mark1><br>
Come, if thou dar'st, all charming as thou <mark4>art!</mark4><br>
Oppose thyself to Heav'n; dispute my <mark1>heart;</mark1><br>
Come, with one glance of those deluding <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
Blot out each bright idea of the <mark1>skies;</mark1><br>
Take back that grace, those <mark4>sorrows</mark4>, and those <mark1>tears;</mark1><br>
Take back my fruitless penitence and <mark4>pray'rs;</mark4><br>
Snatch me, just mounting, from the blest <mark1>abode;</mark1><br>
Assist the fiends, and tear me from my <mark1>God!</mark1><br>
<br>
No, fly me, fly me, far as pole from <mark1>pole;</mark1><br>
Rise Alps between us! and whole oceans <mark1>roll!</mark1><br>
Ah, come not, write not, think not once of <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Nor share one pang of all I felt for <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
Thy oaths I quit, thy memory <mark1>resign;</mark1><br>
Forget, renounce me, hate whate'er was <mark1>mine.</mark1><br>
Fair eyes, and tempting looks (which yet I <mark1>view!)</mark1><br>
Long lov'd, ador'd ideas, all <mark3>adieu!</mark3><br>
Oh Grace serene! oh virtue heav'nly <mark3>fair!</mark3><br>
Divine oblivion of low-thoughted <mark1>care!</mark1><br>
Fresh blooming hope, gay daughter of the <mark3>sky!</mark3><br>
And faith, our early <mark4>immortality!</mark4><br>
Enter, each mild, each amicable <mark4>guest;</mark4><br>
Receive, and wrap me in eternal <mark1>rest!</mark1><br>
<br>
See in her cell sad Eloisa <mark4>spread,</mark4><br>
Propp'd on some tomb, a neighbour of the <mark1>dead.</mark1><br>
In each low wind methinks a spirit <mark4>calls,</mark4><br>
And more than echoes talk along the <mark3>walls.</mark3><br>
Here, as I watch'd the dying lamps <mark4>around,</mark4><br>
From yonder shrine I heard a hollow <mark3>sound.</mark3><br>
"Come, sister, come!" (it said, or seem'd to <mark1>say)</mark1><br>
"Thy place is here, sad sister, come <mark1>away!</mark1><br>
Once like thyself, I trembled, wept, and <mark4>pray'd,</mark4><br>
Love's victim then, though now a sainted <mark1>maid:</mark1><br>
But all is calm in this eternal <mark3>sleep;</mark3><br>
Here grief forgets to groan, and love to <mark1>weep,</mark1><br>
Ev'n superstition loses ev'ry <mark4>fear:</mark4><br>
For God, not man, absolves our frailties <mark4>here."</mark4><br>
<br>
I come, I come! prepare your roseate <mark4>bow'rs,</mark4><br>
Celestial <mark4>palms</mark4>, and ever-blooming <mark3>flow'rs.</mark3><br>
Thither, where sinners may have rest, I <mark1>go,</mark1><br>
Where flames refin'd in breasts seraphic <mark3>glow:</mark3><br>
Thou, Abelard! the last sad office <mark3>pay,</mark3><br>
And smooth my passage to the realms of <mark1>day;</mark1><br>
See my lips <mark4>tremble</mark4>, and my eye-balls <mark1>roll,</mark1><br>
Suck my last breath, and catch my flying <mark1>soul!</mark1><br>
Ah no?in sacred vestments may'st thou <mark4>stand,</mark4><br>
The hallow'd taper trembling in thy <mark1>hand,</mark1><br>
Present the cross before my lifted <mark1>eye,</mark1><br>
Teach me at once, and learn of me to <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
Ah then, thy once-lov'd Eloisa <mark1>see!</mark1><br>
It will be then no crime to gaze on <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
See from my cheek the transient roses <mark3>fly!</mark3><br>
See the last sparkle languish in my <mark1>eye!</mark1><br>
Till ev'ry motion, pulse, and breath be <mark3>o'er;</mark3><br>
And ev'n my Abelard be lov'd no <mark4>more.</mark4><br>
O Death all-eloquent! you only <mark1>prove</mark1><br>
What dust we dote on, when 'tis man we <mark1>love.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then too, when fate shall thy fair frame <mark3>destroy,</mark3><br>
(That cause of all my guilt, and all my <mark1>joy)</mark1><br>
In trance ecstatic may thy pangs be <mark1>drown'd,</mark1><br>
Bright clouds <mark4>descend</mark4>, and angels watch thee <mark1>round,</mark1><br>
From op'ning skies may streaming glories <mark4>shine,</mark4><br>
And saints embrace thee with a love like <mark1>mine.</mark1><br>
<br>
May one kind grave unite each hapless <mark1>name,</mark1><br>
And graft my love immortal on thy <mark1>fame!</mark1><br>
Then, ages hence, when all my woes are <mark1>o'er,</mark1><br>
When this rebellious heart shall beat no <mark1>more;</mark1><br>
If ever chance two wand'ring lovers <mark4>brings</mark4><br>
To Paraclete's white walls and silver <mark3>springs,</mark3><br>
O'er the pale marble shall they join their <mark4>heads,</mark4><br>
And drink the falling tears each other <mark3>sheds;</mark3><br>
Then sadly say, with mutual pity <mark5>mov'd,</mark5><br>
"Oh may we never love as these have <mark5>lov'd!"</mark5><br>
<br>
From the full choir when loud Hosannas <mark1>rise,</mark1><br>
And swell the pomp of dreadful <mark4>sacrifice,</mark4><br>
Amid that scene if some relenting <mark1>eye</mark1><br>
Glance on the stone where our cold relics <mark1>lie,</mark1><br>
Devotion's self shall steal a thought from <mark1>Heav'n,</mark1><br>
One human tear shall drop and be <mark1>forgiv'n.</mark1><br>
And sure, if fate some future bard shall <mark1>join</mark1><br>
In sad similitude of griefs to <mark1>mine,</mark1><br>
Condemn'd whole years in absence to <mark3>deplore,</mark3><br>
And image charms he must behold no <mark1>more;</mark1><br>
Such if there be, who loves so long, so <mark4>well;</mark4><br>
Let him our sad, our tender story <mark3>tell;</mark3><br>
The well-sung woes will soothe my pensive <mark4>ghost;</mark4><br>
He best can paint 'em, who shall feel 'em <mark3>most.</mark3><br>
