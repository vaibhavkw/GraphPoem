Title : Kissing Stieglitz Good-Bye <br>
Author : Gerald Stern <br><br>

Every city in America is <mark4>approached</mark4><br>
through a work of art, usually a bridge <br>
but sometimes a road that curves underneath <br>
or drops down from the sky. Pittsburgh has a <mark4>tunnel--</mark4><br>
<br>
you don't know it--that takes you through the <mark4>rivers</mark4><br>
and under the burning hills. I went there to <mark3>cry</mark3><br>
in the woods or carry my heavy <mark4>bicycle</mark4><br>
through fire and flood. Some have little <mark4>parks--</mark4><br>
<br>
San Francisco has a park. <mark4>Albuquerque</mark4><br>
is beautiful from a distance; it is <mark4>purple</mark4><br>
at five in the evening. New York is <mark4>Egyptian,</mark4><br>
especially from the little rise on the <mark4>hill</mark4><br>
<br>
at 14-C; it has twelve <mark4>entrances</mark4><br>
like the body of Jesus, and Easton, where I lived,   <br>
has two small floating bridges in front of <mark4>it</mark4><br>
that brought me in and out. I said <mark3>good-bye</mark3><br>
<br>
to them both when I was 57. I'm <mark4>reading</mark4><br>
Joseph Wood Krutch again--the second time. <br>
I love how he lived in the desert. I'm looking at the <mark4>skull</mark4><br>
of Georgia O'Keeffe. I'm kissing Stieglitz <mark1>good-bye.</mark1><br>
<br>
He was a <mark1>city</mark1>, Stieglitz was truly a <mark4>city</mark4><br>
in every sense of the word; he wore a library   <br>
across his chest; he had a church on his <mark4>knees.</mark4><br>
I'm kissing him good-bye; he was, for me, <br>
<br>
the last true city; after him there were   <br>
only overpasses and shopping <mark4>centers,</mark4><br>
little enclaves here and there, a <mark4>skyscraper</mark4><br>
with nothing near it, maybe a meaningless turf <br>
<br>
where whores couldn't even walk, where nobody <mark4>sits,</mark4><br>
where nobody either lies or runs; either <mark4>that</mark4><br>
or some pure desert: a lizard under a boojum,   <br>
a flower sucking the water out of a <mark4>rock.</mark4><br>
<br>
What is the life of sadness worth, the <mark4>bookstores</mark4><br>
lost, the drugstores buried, a man with a <mark4>stick</mark4><br>
turning the bricks up, numbering the <mark4>shards,</mark4><br>
dream twenty-one, dream twenty-two. I <mark4>left</mark4><br>
<br>
with a glass of tears, a little artistic <mark4>vial.</mark4><br>
I put it in my leather pockets <mark4>next</mark4><br>
to my flask of Scotch, my golden knife and my <mark4>keys,</mark4><br>
my joyful poems and my T-shirts. Stieglitz is there <br>
<br>
beside his famous number; there is <mark4>smoke</mark4><br>
and fire above his head; some bowlegged <mark4>painter</mark4><br>
is whispering in his ear; some <mark4>lady-in-waiting</mark4><br>
is taking down his words. I'm kissing <mark4>Stieglitz</mark4><br>
<br>
good-bye, my arms are wrapped around him, his <mark4>photos</mark4><br>
are making me cry; we're walking down Fifth Avenue;   <br>
we're looking for a <mark4>pencil</mark4>, there is a <mark4>girl</mark4><br>
standing against the wall--I'm shaking now <br>
<br>
when I think of her; there are two buildings, <mark4>one</mark4><br>
is in blackness, there is a dying <mark4>poplar;</mark4><br>
there is a light on the meadow; there is a <mark4>man</mark4><br>
on a sagging porch. I would have believed in <mark4>everything.</mark4><br>
