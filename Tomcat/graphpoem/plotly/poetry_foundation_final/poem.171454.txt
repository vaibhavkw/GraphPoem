Title : Benjamin Banneker Helps to Build a City <br>
Author : Jay Wright <br><br>

In a morning <mark4>coat,</mark4><br>
hands locked behind your <mark4>back,</mark4><br>
you walk gravely along the lines in your <mark4>head.</mark4><br>
These others stand with <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
squinting the city into <mark4>place,</mark4><br>
yet cannot see what you <mark1>see,</mark1><br>
what you would <mark1>see</mark1><br>
?a vision of these <mark4>paths,</mark4><br>
laid out like a <mark5>star,</mark5><br>
or like a <mark1>body,</mark1><br>
the seed vibrating within <mark1>itself,</mark1><br>
breaking into the <mark4>open,</mark4><br>
dancing up to stop at the end of the <mark4>universe.</mark4><br>
I say your vision goes as far as <mark4>this,</mark4><br>
the egg of the <mark4>world,</mark4><br>
where everything <mark4>remains</mark4>, and <mark4>moves,</mark4><br>
holding what is most against it against <mark1>itself,</mark1><br>
moving, as though it knew its end, against <mark4>death.</mark4><br>
In that <mark4>order,</mark4><br>
the smallest life, the small event take shape.<br>
Yes, even here at this <mark4>point,</mark4><br>
Amma's plan consumes <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
the prefigured man, Nommo, the son of <mark4>God.</mark4><br>
I call you into this <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
back to that <mark4>spot</mark4><br>
and read these prefigurations <br>
into your <mark4>mind,</mark4><br>
and know it could not be strange to <mark1>you</mark1><br>
to stand in the dark and <mark4>emptiness</mark4><br>
of a city not your vision <mark4>alone.</mark4><br>
Now, I have searched the <mark4>texts</mark4><br>
and forms of cities that <mark4>burned,</mark4><br>
that decayed, or gave their children away, <br>
have been picking at my <mark4>skin,</mark4><br>
watching my hand <mark5>move,</mark5><br>
feeling the weight and shuttle of my <mark1>body,</mark1><br>
listening with an ear as large as <mark4>God's</mark4><br>
to catch some familiar tone in my <mark4>voice.</mark4><br>
Now, I am here in your <mark4>city,</mark4><br>
trying to find that <mark1>spot</mark1><br>
where the vibration <mark4>starts.</mark4><br>
There must be some <mark4>mistake.</mark4><br>
<br>
Over the <mark4>earth,</mark4><br>
in an open <mark4>space,</mark4><br>
you and I step to the <mark1>time</mark1><br>
of another <mark4>ceremony.</mark4><br>
These people, <mark4>changed,</mark4><br>
but still <mark4>ours,</mark4><br>
shake another <mark4>myth</mark4><br>
from that egg.<br>
Some will tell <mark1>you</mark1><br>
that beginnings are <mark4>only</mark4><br>
possible <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
that only the clamor of these <mark4>drums</mark4><br>
could bring our God to <mark1>earth.</mark1><br>
A city, like a <mark4>life,</mark4><br>
must be made in <mark4>purity.</mark4><br>
<br>
So they call <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
knowing you are intimate with <mark4>stars,</mark4><br>
to create this <mark4>city</mark4>, this <mark1>body.</mark1><br>
So they call <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
knowing you must purge the <mark4>ground.</mark4><br>
<br>
"Sir, suffer me to recall to your mind that time, in which the arms and tyranny of the British crown were exerted, with every powerful effort in order to reduce you to a state of servitude: look back, I entreat you, on the variety of dangers to which you were exposed; reflect on that time, in which every human aid appeared unavailable, and in which even hope and fortitude wore the aspect of inability to the conflict, and you cannot but be led to a serious and grateful sense of your miraculous and providential preservation; you cannot but acknowledge, that the present freedom and tranquility which you enjoy you have mercifully received, and that it is the peculiar blessing of <mark4>Heaven."</mark4><br>
<br>
"Reflect on that <mark1>time."</mark1><br>
The spirits move, <mark4>even</mark4><br>
in the events of <mark4>men,</mark4><br>
hidden in a <mark5>language</mark5><br>
that cannot hide <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
You were never <mark4>lost</mark4><br>
in the language of number <mark1>alone;</mark1><br>
you were never <mark1>lost</mark1><br>
to the seed vibrating <mark1>alone,</mark1><br>
holding all contradictions within <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
"Look back, I entreat <mark1>you,"</mark1><br>
over your own painful <mark4>escapes.</mark4><br>
The seed now vibrates into a <mark1>city,</mark1><br>
<br>
and a man now walks where you <mark4>walked.</mark4><br>
Wind and rain must assault <mark4>him,</mark4><br>
and a man must build against <mark4>them.</mark4><br>
We know now, too, that the <mark4>house</mark4><br>
must take the form of a <mark4>man</mark4><br>
?warmth at his head, movement at his <mark4>feet,</mark4><br>
his needs and his shrine at his <mark4>hands.</mark4><br>
Image of shelter image of <mark1>man</mark1><br>
pulled back into <mark4>himself</mark4><br>
into the seed before the <mark4>movement,</mark4><br>
into the silence before the <mark3>sound</mark3><br>
of movement, into <mark4>stillness,</mark4><br>
which may be <mark4>self-regard,</mark4><br>
or only <mark1>stillness.</mark1><br>
Recall <mark4>number.</mark4><br>
<br>
Recall your <mark4>calculations,</mark4><br>
your <mark3>sight</mark3>, at <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
into the secrets of <mark1>stars.</mark1><br>
But still you must exorcise this <mark1>ground.</mark1><br>
"Here was a time, in which your tender feelings for yourselves had engaged you thus to declare, you were then impressed with proper ideas of the great violation of liberty, and the free possession of those blessings, to which you were entitled by nature; but, Sir, how pitiable it is to reflect, that although you were so fully convinced of the benevolence of the Father of Mankind, and of his equal and impartial distribution of these rights and privileges, which he hath conferred upon them, that you should at the same time counteract his mercies, in detaining by fraud and violence so numerous a part of my brethren, under groaning captivity, and cruel oppression, that you should at the same time be found guilty of that most criminal act, which you professedly detested in <mark4>others</mark4>, with respect to <mark4>yourselves."</mark4><br>
<br>
Can we say now<br>
<br>
that it is the <mark1>god</mark1><br>
who chains us to this <mark1>place?</mark1><br>
Is it this <mark1>god</mark1><br>
who requires the <mark1>movement,</mark1><br>
the absence of <mark1>movement,</mark1><br>
the prefiguration of <mark1>movement</mark1><br>
only under his <mark4>control?</mark4><br>
If so,<br>
what then is the <mark4>reason</mark4><br>
for these <mark4>dancers,</mark4><br>
these <mark5>invocations,</mark5><br>
the sight of these lesser <mark4>gods</mark4><br>
lining out the <mark4>land?</mark4><br>
How pitiable it is to <mark4>reflect</mark4><br>
upon that god, without <mark3>grace,</mark3><br>
without the sense of that <mark4>small</mark4><br>
beginning of <mark1>movement,</mark1><br>
where even the <mark1>god</mark1><br>
becomes another and not <mark1>himself,</mark1><br>
himself and not <mark4>another.</mark4><br>
So they must call <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
knowing you are intimate with <mark1>stars;</mark1><br>
so they must call <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
knowing different <mark4>resolutions.</mark4><br>
You sit in <mark4>contemplation,</mark4><br>
moving from line to <mark4>line,</mark4><br>
struggling for a <mark1>city</mark1><br>
free of that criminal <mark4>act,</mark4><br>
free of anything but the <mark1>small,</mark1><br>
imperceptible act, which itself becomes <mark3>free.</mark3><br>
Free. Free. How will the lines <mark3>fall</mark3><br>
into that <mark4>configuration?</mark4><br>
How will you clear this <mark4>uneasiness,</mark4><br>
posting your calculations and <mark4>forecasts</mark4><br>
into a world you yourself cannot <mark4>enter?</mark4><br>
Uneasy, at <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
you follow stars and lines to their <mark4>limits,</mark4><br>
sure of yourself, sure of the <mark4>harmony</mark4><br>
of everything, and yet you <mark4>moan</mark4><br>
for the lost harmony, the crack in the <mark1>universe.</mark1><br>
Your twin, I search it <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
and call you <mark1>back;</mark1><br>
your twin, I <mark4>invoke</mark4><br>
the descent of Nommo.<br>
I say your vision goes as far as <mark1>this.</mark1><br>
And so you, Benjamin Banneker, <br>
<br>
walk gravely along these <mark4>lines,</mark4><br>
the city a star, a <mark1>body,</mark1><br>
the seed vibrating within <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
and vibrating <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
beyond your <mark4>power,</mark4><br>
beyond <mark4>mine.</mark4><br>
