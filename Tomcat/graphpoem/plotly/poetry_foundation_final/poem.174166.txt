Title : An Essay on Man: Epistle II <br>
Author : Alexander Pope <br><br>

<br>
Know then thyself, presume not God to <mark3>scan;</mark3><br>
The proper study of mankind is <mark3>man.</mark3><br>
Plac'd on this isthmus of a middle <mark3>state,</mark3><br>
A being darkly wise, and rudely <mark3>great:</mark3><br>
With too much knowledge for the sceptic <mark3>side,</mark3><br>
With too much weakness for the stoic's <mark3>pride,</mark3><br>
He hangs between; in doubt to <mark4>act</mark4>, or <mark4>rest;</mark4><br>
In doubt to deem himself a god, or <mark4>beast;</mark4><br>
In doubt his mind or body to <mark3>prefer;</mark3><br>
Born but to die, and reas'ning but to <mark3>err;</mark3><br>
Alike in ignorance, his reason <mark3>such,</mark3><br>
Whether he thinks too little, or too <mark3>much:</mark3><br>
Chaos of thought and passion, all <mark5>confus'd;</mark5><br>
Still by himself abus'd, or disabus'd;<br>
Created half to rise, and half to <mark3>fall;</mark3><br>
Great lord of all things, yet a prey to <mark3>all;</mark3><br>
Sole judge of truth, in endless error <mark4>hurl'd:</mark4><br>
The glory, jest, and riddle of the <mark4>world!</mark4><br>
<br>
Go, wondrous creature! mount where science <mark4>guides,</mark4><br>
Go, measure earth, weigh air, and state the <mark3>tides;</mark3><br>
Instruct the planets in what orbs to <mark4>run,</mark4><br>
Correct old time, and regulate the <mark3>sun;</mark3><br>
Go, soar with Plato to th' empyreal <mark4>sphere,</mark4><br>
To the first good, first perfect, and first <mark4>fair;</mark4><br>
Or tread the mazy round his follow'rs <mark4>trod,</mark4><br>
And quitting sense call imitating <mark3>God;</mark3><br>
As Eastern priests in giddy circles <mark1>run,</mark1><br>
And turn their heads to imitate the <mark1>sun.</mark1><br>
Go, teach Eternal Wisdom how to <mark4>rule?</mark4><br>
Then drop into thyself, and be a <mark3>fool!</mark3><br>
<br>
Superior beings, when of late they <mark3>saw</mark3><br>
A mortal Man unfold all Nature's <mark3>law,</mark3><br>
Admir'd such wisdom in an earthly <mark3>shape,</mark3><br>
And showed a Newton as we shew an <mark3>Ape.</mark3><br>
<br>
Could he, whose rules the rapid comet <mark4>bind,</mark4><br>
Describe or fix one movement of his <mark3>mind?</mark3><br>
Who saw its fires here rise, and there <mark4>descend,</mark4><br>
Explain his own beginning, or his <mark3>end?</mark3><br>
Alas what wonder! Man's superior <mark4>part</mark4><br>
Uncheck'd may rise, and climb from art to <mark3>art;</mark3><br>
But when his own great work is but <mark3>begun,</mark3><br>
What Reason weaves, by Passion is <mark3>undone.</mark3><br>
<br>
Trace science then, with modesty thy <mark4>guide;</mark4><br>
First strip off all her equipage of <mark1>pride;</mark1><br>
Deduct what is but vanity, or <mark4>dress,</mark4><br>
Or learning's luxury, or <mark4>idleness;</mark4><br>
Or tricks to show the stretch of human <mark4>brain,</mark4><br>
Mere curious pleasure, or ingenious <mark3>pain;</mark3><br>
Expunge the whole, or lop th' excrescent <mark4>parts</mark4><br>
Of all our Vices have created <mark3>Arts;</mark3><br>
Then see how little the remaining <mark3>sum,</mark3><br>
Which serv'd the past, and must the times to <mark3>come!</mark3><br>
<br>
Two principles in human nature <mark3>reign;</mark3><br>
Self-love, to urge, and <mark4>reason</mark4>, to <mark3>restrain;</mark3><br>
Nor this a good, nor that a bad we <mark4>call,</mark4><br>
Each works its end, to move or govern <mark1>all:</mark1><br>
And to their proper operation <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
Ascribe all good; to their improper, <mark3>ill.</mark3><br>
Self-love, the spring of motion, acts the <mark4>soul;</mark4><br>
<br>
Reason's comparing balance rules the <mark3>whole.</mark3><br>
Man, but for that, no action could <mark4>attend,</mark4><br>
And but for this, were active to no <mark1>end:</mark1><br>
Fix'd like a plant on his peculiar <mark4>spot,</mark4><br>
To draw nutrition, <mark4>propagate</mark4>, and <mark3>rot;</mark3><br>
Or, meteor-like, flame lawless through the <mark4>void,</mark4><br>
Destroying <mark4>others</mark4>, by himself <mark4>destroy'd.</mark4><br>
Most strength the moving principle <mark4>requires;</mark4><br>
<br>
Active its task, it prompts, impels, <mark3>inspires.</mark3><br>
Sedate and quiet the comparing <mark4>lies,</mark4><br>
Form'd but to check, delib'rate, and <mark3>advise.</mark3><br>
Self-love still stronger, as its objects <mark3>nigh;</mark3><br>
Reason's at distance, and in prospect <mark3>lie:</mark3><br>
That sees immediate good by present <mark4>sense;</mark4><br>
Reason, the future and the <mark4>consequence.</mark4><br>
Thicker than arguments, temptations <mark3>throng,</mark3><br>
At best more watchful this, but that more <mark3>strong.</mark3><br>
The action of the stronger to <mark4>suspend,</mark4><br>
Reason still use, to reason still <mark1>attend.</mark1><br>
Attention, habit and experience <mark4>gains;</mark4><br>
Each strengthens reason, and self-love <mark3>restrains.</mark3><br>
Let subtle schoolmen teach these friends to <mark4>fight,</mark4><br>
<br>
More studious to divide than to <mark4>unite,</mark4><br>
And grace and virtue, sense and reason <mark4>split,</mark4><br>
With all the rash dexterity of <mark3>wit:</mark3><br>
Wits, just like fools, at war about a <mark4>name,</mark4><br>
Have full as oft no meaning, or the <mark3>same.</mark3><br>
Self-love and reason to one end <mark4>aspire,</mark4><br>
Pain their aversion, pleasure their <mark5>desire;</mark5><br>
But greedy that its object would <mark4>devour,</mark4><br>
This taste the honey, and not wound the <mark4>flow'r:</mark4><br>
Pleasure, or wrong or rightly <mark4>understood,</mark4><br>
Our greatest evil, or our greatest <mark3>good.</mark3><br>
Modes of self-love the passions we may <mark1>call:</mark1><br>
<br>
'Tis real good, or seeming, moves them <mark1>all:</mark1><br>
But since not every good we can <mark4>divide,</mark4><br>
And reason bids us for our own <mark3>provide;</mark3><br>
Passions, though selfish, if their means be <mark1>fair,</mark1><br>
List under reason, and deserve her <mark3>care;</mark3><br>
Those, that imparted, court a nobler <mark3>aim,</mark3><br>
Exalt their kind, and take some virtue's <mark1>name.</mark1><br>
In lazy apathy let Stoics <mark4>boast</mark4><br>
Their virtue fix'd, 'tis fix'd as in a <mark4>frost;</mark4><br>
<br>
Contracted all, retiring to the <mark4>breast;</mark4><br>
But strength of mind is exercise, not <mark1>rest:</mark1><br>
The rising tempest puts in act the <mark1>soul,</mark1><br>
Parts it may ravage, but preserves the <mark1>whole.</mark1><br>
On life's vast ocean diversely we <mark4>sail,</mark4><br>
Reason the card, but passion is the <mark3>gale;</mark3><br>
Nor God alone in the still calm we <mark4>find,</mark4><br>
He mounts the storm, and walks upon the <mark3>wind.</mark3><br>
Passions, like elements, though born to <mark1>fight,</mark1><br>
Yet, mix'd and soften'd, in his work <mark1>unite:</mark1><br>
<br>
These 'tis enough to temper and <mark3>employ;</mark3><br>
But what composes man, can man <mark3>destroy?</mark3><br>
Suffice that reason keep to nature's <mark4>road,</mark4><br>
Subject, compound them, follow her and <mark1>God.</mark1><br>
Love, hope, and joy, fair pleasure's smiling <mark3>train,</mark3><br>
Hate, fear, and grief, the family of <mark1>pain,</mark1><br>
These mix'd with art, and to due bounds <mark5>confin'd,</mark5><br>
Make and maintain the balance of the <mark1>mind:</mark1><br>
The lights and shades, whose well accorded <mark5>strife</mark5><br>
Gives all the strength and colour of our <mark3>life.</mark3><br>
Pleasures are ever in our hands or <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
And when in act they cease, in prospect, <mark3>rise:</mark3><br>
<br>
Present to grasp, and future still to <mark1>find,</mark1><br>
The whole employ of body and of <mark1>mind.</mark1><br>
All spread their charms, but charm not all <mark3>alike;</mark3><br>
On diff'rent senses diff'rent objects <mark3>strike;</mark3><br>
Hence diff'rent passions more or less <mark3>inflame,</mark3><br>
As strong or weak, the organs of the <mark3>frame;</mark3><br>
And hence one master passion in the <mark1>breast,</mark1><br>
Like Aaron's <mark4>serpent</mark4>, swallows up the <mark1>rest.</mark1><br>
As man, perhaps, the moment of his <mark5>breath,</mark5><br>
Receives the lurking principle of <mark3>death;</mark3><br>
<br>
The young disease, that must subdue at <mark4>length,</mark4><br>
Grows with his <mark4>growth</mark4>, and strengthens with his <mark3>strength:</mark3><br>
So, cast and mingled with his very <mark1>frame,</mark1><br>
The mind's disease, its ruling passion <mark3>came;</mark3><br>
Each vital humour which should feed the <mark1>whole,</mark1><br>
Soon flows to this, in body and in <mark1>soul.</mark1><br>
Whatever warms the heart, or fills the <mark4>head,</mark4><br>
As the mind opens, and its functions <mark3>spread,</mark3><br>
Imagination plies her dang'rous <mark1>art,</mark1><br>
And pours it all upon the peccant <mark1>part.</mark1><br>
Nature its mother, habit is its <mark4>nurse;</mark4><br>
Wit, spirit, faculties, but make it <mark3>worse;</mark3><br>
<br>
Reason itself but gives it edge and <mark4>pow'r;</mark4><br>
As Heav'n's blest beam turns vinegar more <mark4>sour.</mark4><br>
We, wretched subjects, though to lawful <mark3>sway,</mark3><br>
In this weak queen some fav'rite still <mark3>obey:</mark3><br>
Ah! if she lend not <mark4>arms</mark4>, as well as <mark4>rules,</mark4><br>
What can she more than tell us we are <mark3>fools?</mark3><br>
Teach us to mourn our nature, not to <mark4>mend,</mark4><br>
A sharp accuser, but a helpless <mark3>friend!</mark3><br>
Or from a judge turn pleader, to <mark4>persuade</mark4><br>
The choice we make, or justify it <mark3>made;</mark3><br>
Proud of an easy conquest all <mark3>along,</mark3><br>
She but removes weak passions for the <mark1>strong:</mark1><br>
So, when small humours gather to a <mark4>gout,</mark4><br>
The doctor fancies he has driv'n them <mark3>out.</mark3><br>
Yes, nature's road must ever be <mark5>preferr'd;</mark5><br>
Reason is here no <mark4>guide</mark4>, but still a <mark4>guard:</mark4><br>
<br>
'Tis hers to rectify, not overthrow,<br>
And treat this passion more as friend than foe:<br>
A mightier pow'r the strong direction <mark4>sends,</mark4><br>
And sev'ral men impels to sev'ral <mark3>ends.</mark3><br>
Like varying <mark4>winds</mark4>, by other passions <mark4>toss'd,</mark4><br>
This drives them constant to a certain <mark4>coast.</mark4><br>
Let pow'r or knowledge, gold or glory, <mark4>please,</mark4><br>
Or (oft more strong than all) the love of <mark3>ease;</mark3><br>
Through life 'tis followed, ev'n at life's <mark4>expense;</mark4><br>
The merchant's toil, the sage's indolence,<br>
The monk's humility, the hero's <mark1>pride,</mark1><br>
All, all alike, find reason on their <mark1>side.</mark1><br>
Th' eternal art educing good from <mark1>ill,</mark1><br>
Grafts on this passion our best <mark4>principle:</mark4><br>
<br>
'Tis thus the mercury of man is <mark4>fix'd,</mark4><br>
Strong grows the virtue with his nature <mark3>mix'd;</mark3><br>
The dross cements what else were too <mark1>refin'd,</mark1><br>
And in one interest body acts with <mark1>mind.</mark1><br>
As fruits, ungrateful to the planter's <mark1>care,</mark1><br>
On savage stocks inserted, learn to <mark3>bear;</mark3><br>
<br>
The surest virtues thus from passions <mark4>shoot,</mark4><br>
Wild nature's vigor working at the <mark3>root.</mark3><br>
What crops of wit and honesty <mark4>appear</mark4><br>
From spleen, from obstinacy, hate, or <mark3>fear!</mark3><br>
See anger, zeal and fortitude <mark3>supply;</mark3><br>
Ev'n av'rice, prudence; sloth, <mark4>philosophy;</mark4><br>
Lust, through some certain strainers well <mark1>refin'd,</mark1><br>
Is gentle love, and charms all womankind;<br>
Envy, to which th' ignoble mind's a <mark3>slave,</mark3><br>
Is emulation in the learn'd or <mark3>brave;</mark3><br>
Nor virtue, male or female, can we <mark1>name,</mark1><br>
But what will grow on pride, or grow on <mark3>shame.</mark3><br>
Thus nature gives us (let it check our <mark1>pride)</mark1><br>
The virtue nearest to our vice <mark3>allied:</mark3><br>
<br>
Reason the byass turns to good from <mark1>ill,</mark1><br>
And Nero reigns a Titus, if he <mark3>will.</mark3><br>
The fiery soul abhorr'd in Catiline,<br>
In Decius charms, in Curtius is <mark4>divine:</mark4><br>
The same ambition can destroy or <mark3>save,</mark3><br>
And make a patriot as it makes a <mark3>knave.</mark3><br>
This light and darkness in our chaos <mark4>join'd,</mark4><br>
What shall divide? The God within the <mark1>mind.</mark1><br>
<br>
Extremes in nature equal ends <mark4>produce,</mark4><br>
In man they join to some mysterious <mark3>use;</mark3><br>
Though each by turns the other's bound <mark4>invade,</mark4><br>
<br>
As, in some well-wrought picture, light and <mark3>shade,</mark3><br>
And oft so <mark4>mix</mark4>, the diff'rence is too <mark4>nice</mark4><br>
Where ends the virtue, or begins the <mark3>vice.</mark3><br>
Fools! who from hence into the notion <mark1>fall,</mark1><br>
That vice or virtue there is none at <mark1>all.</mark1><br>
If white and black blend, soften, and <mark1>unite</mark1><br>
<br>
A thousand ways, is there no black or <mark4>white?</mark4><br>
Ask your own heart, and nothing is so <mark4>plain;</mark4><br>
'Tis to mistake them, costs the time and <mark1>pain.</mark1><br>
Vice is a monster of so frightful <mark4>mien,</mark4><br>
As, to be hated, needs but to be <mark3>seen;</mark3><br>
Yet seen too oft, familiar with her <mark4>face,</mark4><br>
<br>
We first endure, then pity, then <mark3>embrace.</mark3><br>
But where th' extreme of vice, was ne'er <mark4>agreed:</mark4><br>
Ask where's the North? at York, 'tis on the <mark3>Tweed;</mark3><br>
In Scotland, at the Orcades; and <mark4>there,</mark4><br>
At Greenland, Zembla, or the Lord knows <mark3>where:</mark3><br>
No creature owns it in the first <mark3>degree,</mark3><br>
But thinks his neighbour farther gone than <mark3>he!</mark3><br>
Ev'n those who dwell beneath its very <mark4>zone,</mark4><br>
Or never feel the rage, or never <mark3>own;</mark3><br>
What happier natures shrink at with affright,<br>
The hard inhabitant contends is <mark3>right.</mark3><br>
Virtuous and vicious ev'ry man must <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
Few in th' extreme, but all in the <mark1>degree;</mark1><br>
The rogue and fool by fits is fair and <mark4>wise;</mark4><br>
And ev'n the best, by fits, what they <mark3>despise.</mark3><br>
<br>
'Tis but by parts we follow good or <mark1>ill,</mark1><br>
For, vice or virtue, self directs it <mark1>still;</mark1><br>
Each individual seeks a sev'ral <mark4>goal;</mark4><br>
But heav'n's great view is one, and that the <mark1>whole:</mark1><br>
That counterworks each folly and <mark4>caprice;</mark4><br>
That disappoints th' effect of ev'ry <mark1>vice;</mark1><br>
That, happy frailties to all ranks <mark4>applied,</mark4><br>
Shame to the virgin, to the matron <mark1>pride,</mark1><br>
Fear to the statesman, rashness to the <mark4>chief,</mark4><br>
To kings presumption, and to crowds <mark3>belief,</mark3><br>
That, virtue's ends from vanity can <mark4>raise,</mark4><br>
Which seeks no int'rest, no reward but <mark3>praise;</mark3><br>
And build on wants, and on defects of <mark1>mind,</mark1><br>
The joy, the peace, the glory of <mark3>mankind.</mark3><br>
Heav'n forming each on other to <mark4>depend,</mark4><br>
A master, or a servant, or a <mark1>friend,</mark1><br>
Bids each on other for assistance <mark1>call,</mark1><br>
'Till one man's weakness grows the strength of <mark1>all.</mark1><br>
Wants, frailties, passions, closer still <mark3>ally</mark3><br>
<br>
The common int'rest, or endear the <mark3>tie:</mark3><br>
To these we owe true friendship, love <mark4>sincere,</mark4><br>
Each home-felt joy that life inherits <mark4>here;</mark4><br>
Yet from the same we <mark4>learn</mark4>, in its <mark4>decline,</mark4><br>
Those joys, those loves, those int'rests to <mark3>resign;</mark3><br>
Taught half by reason, half by mere <mark3>decay,</mark3><br>
To welcome death, and calmly pass <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
       Whate'er the passion, knowledge, fame, or pelf,<br>
Not one will change his neighbour with <mark4>himself.</mark4><br>
The learn'd is happy nature to <mark4>explore,</mark4><br>
The fool is happy that he knows no <mark3>more;</mark3><br>
The rich is happy in the plenty giv'n,<br>
<br>
The poor contents him with the care of <mark5>heav'n.</mark5><br>
See the blind beggar dance, the cripple <mark4>sing,</mark4><br>
The sot a hero, lunatic a <mark3>king;</mark3><br>
The starving chemist in his golden <mark4>views</mark4><br>
Supremely blest, the poet in his <mark3>Muse.</mark3><br>
See some strange comfort ev'ry state <mark1>attend,</mark1><br>
And pride bestow'd on all, a common <mark1>friend;</mark1><br>
See some fit passion ev'ry age <mark1>supply,</mark1><br>
Hope travels through, nor quits us when we <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
Behold the child, by nature's kindly <mark1>law,</mark1><br>
<br>
Pleas'd with a rattle, tickl'd with a <mark3>straw:</mark3><br>
Some livelier plaything gives his youth <mark3>delight,</mark3><br>
A little louder, but as empty <mark3>quite:</mark3><br>
Scarfs, garters, gold, amuse his riper <mark5>stage,</mark5><br>
<br>
And beads and pray'r books are the toys of <mark3>age:</mark3><br>
Pleas'd with this bauble still, as that <mark3>before;</mark3><br>
'Till tir'd he sleeps, and life's poor play is <mark4>o'er!</mark4><br>
Meanwhile opinion gilds with varying <mark4>rays</mark4><br>
Those painted clouds that beautify our <mark3>days;</mark3><br>
Each want of happiness by hope <mark4>supplied,</mark4><br>
And each vacuity of sense by <mark1>Pride:</mark1><br>
These build as fast as knowledge can <mark1>destroy;</mark1><br>
<br>
In folly's cup still laughs the bubble, <mark3>joy;</mark3><br>
One prospect lost, another still we <mark4>gain;</mark4><br>
And not a vanity is giv'n in <mark3>vain;</mark3><br>
Ev'n mean self-love becomes, by force <mark1>divine,</mark1><br>
The scale to measure others' wants by <mark3>thine.</mark3><br>
See! and confess, one comfort still must <mark1>rise,</mark1><br>
'Tis this: Though man's a fool, yet God is <mark1>wise.</mark1><br>
