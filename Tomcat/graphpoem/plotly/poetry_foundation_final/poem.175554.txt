Title : from Satire V: On Women <br>
Author : Edward Young <br><br>

Man's rich with little, were his judgment <mark3>true,</mark3><br>
Nature is frugal, and her wants are <mark3>few;</mark3><br>
Those few wants answer'd, bring sincere <mark4>delights,</mark4><br>
But fools create themselves new <mark4>appetites:</mark4><br>
Fancy and pride seek things at vast expence, <br>
Which relish not to reason nor to <mark4>sense.</mark4><br>
When surfeit, or unthankfulness, <mark3>destroys,</mark3><br>
In nature's narrow sphere, our solid <mark3>joys,</mark3><br>
In fancy's airy land of noise and <mark3>show,</mark3><br>
Where nought but dreams, no real pleasures <mark3>grow;</mark3><br>
Like cats in air-pumps, to subsist we <mark3>strive</mark3><br>
On joys too thin to keep the soul <mark3>alive.</mark3><br>
