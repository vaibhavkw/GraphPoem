Title : Astrophil and Stella 20: Fly, fly, my friends, I have my death wound, fly <br>
Author : Sir Philip Sidney <br><br>

Fly, fly, my friends, I have my death wound, <mark3>fly!</mark3><br>
See there that boy, that murd'ring boy, I <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
Who, like a thief, hid in dark bush doth <mark3>lie</mark3><br>
Till bloody bullet get him wrongful <mark3>prey.</mark3><br>
So tyrant he no fitter place could <mark3>spy,</mark3><br>
Nor so fair level in so secret <mark3>stay,</mark3><br>
As that sweet black which veils the heav'nly <mark3>eye;</mark3><br>
There himself with his shot he close doth <mark3>lay.</mark3><br>
Poor passenger, pass now thereby I <mark3>did,</mark3><br>
And stay'd, pleas'd with the prospect of the <mark3>place,</mark3><br>
While that black hue from me the bad guest <mark3>hid;</mark3><br>
But straight I saw motions of lightning <mark3>grace</mark3><br>
And then descried the glist'ring of his <mark3>dart:</mark3><br>
But ere I could fly thence it pierc'd my <mark3>heart.</mark3><br>
