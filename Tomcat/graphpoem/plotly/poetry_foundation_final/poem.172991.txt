Title : Sonnets from the Portuguese 7: The face of all the world is changed, I think <br>
Author : Elizabeth Barrett Browning <br><br>

The face of all the world is changed, I <mark3>think,</mark3><br>
Since first I heard the footsteps of thy <mark3>soul</mark3><br>
Move still, oh, still, beside me, as they <mark3>stole</mark3><br>
Betwixt me and the dreadful outer <mark3>brink</mark3><br>
Of obvious death, where I, who thought to <mark3>sink,</mark3><br>
Was caught up into love, and taught the <mark3>whole</mark3><br>
Of life in a new rhythm. The cup of <mark3>dole</mark3><br>
God gave for baptism, I am fain to <mark3>drink,</mark3><br>
And praise its sweetness, Sweet, with thee anear. <br>
The names of country, heaven, are changed <mark3>away</mark3><br>
For where thou art or shalt be, there or <mark4>here;</mark4><br>
And this ... this lute and song ... loved yesterday, <br>
(The singing angels know) are only <mark4>dear,</mark4><br>
Because thy name moves right in what they <mark3>say.</mark3><br>
