Title : Looking into History <br>
Author : Richard Wilbur <br><br>

<br>
Five soldiers fixed by Mathew Brady's <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
Stand in a land subdued beyond <mark3>belief.</mark3><br>
Belief might lend them life again. I <mark3>try</mark3><br>
Like orphaned Hamlet working up his <mark3>grief</mark3><br>
To see my spellbound fathers in these <mark3>men</mark3><br>
<br>
Who, breathless in their amber <mark4>atmosphere,</mark4><br>
Show but the postures men affected <mark3>then</mark3><br>
And the hermit faces of a finished <mark4>year.</mark4><br>
The guns and gear and all are strange <mark3>until</mark3><br>
<br>
Beyond the tents I glimpse a file of <mark3>trees</mark3><br>
Verging a road that struggles up a <mark3>hill.</mark3><br>
They're sycamores. <br>
The long-abated <mark3>breeze</mark3><br>
Flares in those boughs I know, and hauls the <mark3>sound</mark3><br>
<br>
Of guns and a great forest in <mark4>distress.</mark4><br>
Fathers, I know my cause, and we are <mark3>bound</mark3><br>
Beyond that hill to fight at <mark4>Wilderness.</mark4><br>
But trick your eyes with Birnam Wood, or <mark3>think</mark3><br>
<br>
How fire-cast shadows of the bankside <mark1>trees</mark1><br>
<br>
Rode on the back of Simois to <mark3>sink</mark3><br>
In the wide <mark4>waters</mark4>, Reflect how <mark4>history's</mark4><br>
Changes are like the <mark4>sea's</mark4>, which mauls and <mark4>mulls</mark4><br>
Its salvage of the world in shifty <mark4>waves,</mark4><br>
Shrouding in evergreen the oldest <mark4>hulls</mark4><br>
<br>
And yielding views of its confounded <mark4>graves</mark4><br>
To the new moon, the sun, or any <mark1>eye</mark1><br>
That in its shallow shoreward version <mark4>sees</mark4><br>
The pebbles charging with a deathless <mark3>cry</mark3><br>
<br>
And carageen memorials of <mark1>trees.</mark1><br>
Now, old man of the <mark3>sea,</mark3><br>
I start to <mark4>understand:</mark4><br>
The will will find no <mark4>stillness</mark4><br>
<br>
Back in a stilled <mark3>land.</mark3><br>
<br>
The dead give no <mark3>command</mark3><br>
<br>
And shall not find their <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
Till they be mustered <mark3>by</mark3><br>
Some present fatal <mark3>choice.</mark3><br>
Let me now <mark3>rejoice</mark3><br>
<br>
In all impostures, <mark4>take</mark4><br>
The shape of lion or <mark4>leopard,</mark4><br>
Boar, or watery <mark3>snake,</mark3><br>
Or like the comber <mark3>break,</mark3><br>
<br>
Yet in the end stand <mark3>fast</mark3><br>
And by some fervent <mark4>fraud</mark4><br>
Father the waiting <mark3>past,</mark3><br>
Resembling at the <mark3>last</mark3><br>
<br>
The self-established <mark3>tree</mark3><br>
That draws all waters <mark4>toward</mark4><br>
Its live formality.<br>
