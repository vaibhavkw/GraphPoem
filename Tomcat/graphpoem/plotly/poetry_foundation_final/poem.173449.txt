Title : A Song for St. Cecilia's Day, 1687 <br>
Author : John Dryden <br><br>

Stanza 1 <br>
From <mark1>harmony</mark1>, from Heav'nly <mark1>harmony</mark1><br>
This universal frame <mark1>began.</mark1><br>
When Nature underneath a <mark5>heap</mark5><br>
Of jarring atoms <mark3>lay,</mark3><br>
And could not heave her <mark5>head,</mark5><br>
The tuneful voice was heard from <mark3>high,</mark3><br>
Arise ye more than <mark3>dead.</mark3><br>
Then cold, and hot, and moist, and <mark3>dry,</mark3><br>
In order to their stations <mark3>leap,</mark3><br>
And music's pow'r <mark3>obey.</mark3><br>
From <mark1>harmony</mark1>, from Heav'nly <mark1>harmony</mark1><br>
This universal frame <mark1>began:</mark1><br>
From harmony to <mark1>harmony</mark1><br>
Through all the compass of the notes it <mark3>ran,</mark3><br>
The diapason closing full in <mark3>man.</mark3><br>
<br>
Stanza 2 <br>
What passion cannot music raise and <mark3>quell!</mark3><br>
When Jubal struck the corded <mark3>shell,</mark3><br>
His list'ning brethren stood <mark4>around</mark4><br>
And wond'ring, on their faces <mark3>fell</mark3><br>
To worship that celestial <mark3>sound:</mark3><br>
Less than a god they thought there could not <mark3>dwell</mark3><br>
Within the hollow of that <mark1>shell</mark1><br>
That spoke so sweetly and so <mark3>well.</mark3><br>
What passion cannot music raise and <mark1>quell!</mark1><br>
<br>
Stanza 3 <br>
         The trumpet's loud clangor <br>
Excites us to <mark3>arms</mark3><br>
With shrill notes of <mark4>anger</mark4><br>
And mortal <mark3>alarms.</mark3><br>
The double double double <mark3>beat</mark3><br>
Of the thund'ring <mark3>drum</mark3><br>
Cries, hark the foes <mark3>come;</mark3><br>
Charge, charge, 'tis too late to <mark3>retreat.</mark3><br>
<br>
Stanza 4 <br>
The soft complaining <mark4>flute</mark4><br>
In dying notes <mark4>discovers</mark4><br>
The woes of hopeless <mark3>lovers,</mark3><br>
Whose dirge is whisper'd by the warbling <mark3>lute.</mark3><br>
<br>
Stanza 5 <br>
Sharp violins <mark4>proclaim</mark4><br>
Their jealous pangs, and <mark4>desperation,</mark4><br>
Fury, frantic <mark3>indignation,</mark3><br>
Depth of pains and height of <mark4>passion,</mark4><br>
For the fair, disdainful <mark3>dame.</mark3><br>
<br>
Stanza 6 <br>
But oh! what art can <mark3>teach</mark3><br>
What human voice can <mark3>reach</mark3><br>
The sacred organ's <mark4>praise?</mark4><br>
Notes inspiring holy <mark5>love,</mark5><br>
Notes that wing their Heav'nly <mark3>ways</mark3><br>
To mend the choirs <mark3>above.</mark3><br>
<br>
Stanza 7 <br>
Orpheus could lead the savage <mark3>race;</mark3><br>
And trees unrooted left their <mark3>place;</mark3><br>
Sequacious of the <mark4>lyre:</mark4><br>
But bright Cecilia rais'd the wonder <mark4>high'r;</mark4><br>
         When to her organ, vocal breath was giv'n, <br>
An angel heard, and straight <mark4>appear'd</mark4><br>
                Mistaking earth for Heav'n. <br>
<br>
GRAND <mark4>CHORUS</mark4><br>
As from the pow'r of sacred <mark4>lays</mark4><br>
The spheres began to <mark4>move,</mark4><br>
And sung the great Creator's <mark1>praise</mark1><br>
To all the bless'd <mark1>above;</mark1><br>
So when the last and dreadful <mark4>hour</mark4><br>
This crumbling pageant shall <mark3>devour,</mark3><br>
The trumpet shall be heard on <mark1>high,</mark1><br>
The dead shall live, the living <mark3>die,</mark3><br>
And music shall untune the <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
