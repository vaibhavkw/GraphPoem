Title : Odes <br>
Author : Ricardo Reis <br><br>

<br>
Of the gardens of Adonis, Lydia, I love <br>
Most of all those fugitive roses <br>
That on the day they are <mark4>born,</mark4><br>
That very day, must also <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
Eternal, for them, the light of <mark1>day:</mark1><br>
They're born when the sun is already <mark3>high</mark3><br>
         And die before Apollo's course<br>
<br>
Across the visible sky is <mark4>run.</mark4><br>
We too, of our lives, must make one <mark1>day:</mark1><br>
We never know, my Lydia, nor <mark4>want</mark4><br>
To know of nights before or <mark3>after</mark3><br>
The little while that we may <mark4>last.</mark4><br>
<br>
To be great, be whole: nothing that's <mark3>you</mark3><br>
         Should you exaggerate or exclude. <br>
In each thing, be all. Give all you <mark3>are</mark3><br>
In the least you ever <mark3>do.</mark3><br>
The whole moon, because it rides so <mark1>high,</mark1><br>
         Is reflected in each pool. <br>
