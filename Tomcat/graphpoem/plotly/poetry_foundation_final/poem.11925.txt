To hurt the Negro and avoid the Jew <br>
Is the curriculum. In <mark4>mid-September</mark4><br>
The entering boys, identified by <mark4>hats,</mark4><br>
Wander in a maze of mannered <mark4>brick</mark4><br>
Where boxwood and magnolia <mark4>brood</mark4><br>
And columns with imperious <mark4>stance</mark4><br>
Like rows of ante-bellum <mark4>girls</mark4><br>
         Eye them, outlanders.<br>
<br>
In whited cells, on lawns equipped for <mark4>peace,</mark4><br>
Under the arch, and lofty <mark4>banister,</mark4><br>
Equals shake hands, unequals blankly <mark4>pass;</mark4><br>
The exemplary weather whispers, <mark2>"Quiet</mark2>, <mark2>quiet"</mark2><br>
      And visitors on tiptoe leave<br>
For the raw North, the unfinished <mark4>West,</mark4><br>
      As the young, detecting an advantage, <br>
Practice a <mark4>face.</mark4><br>
<br>
Where, on their separate hill, the <mark4>colleges,</mark4><br>
Like manor houses of an older law,<br>
Gaze down embankments on a land in fee, <br>
The Deans, dry spinsters over family <mark4>plate,</mark4><br>
Ring out the English name like <mark4>coin,</mark4><br>
Humor the snob and lure the <mark4>lout.</mark4><br>
Within the precincts of this <mark4>world</mark4><br>
         Poise is a club.<br>
<br>
But on the neighboring range, misty and high, <br>
The past is absolute: some luckless <mark3>race</mark3><br>
Dull with inbreeding and conformity<br>
Wears out its heart, and comes barefoot and <mark4>bad</mark4><br>
For charity or jail. The <mark4>scholar</mark4><br>
Sanctions their obsolete <mark4>disease;</mark4><br>
The gentleman revolts with <mark3>shame</mark3><br>
At his <mark4>ancestor.</mark4><br>
<br>
And the true nobleman, once a <mark4>democrat,</mark4><br>
Sleeps on his private <mark4>mountain</mark4>, He was <mark4>one</mark4><br>
Whose thought was shapely and whose dream was <mark4>broad;</mark4><br>
This school he held his art and epitaph.<br>
But now it takes from him his <mark3>name,</mark3><br>
Falls open like a dishonest <mark4>look,</mark4><br>
And shows us, rotted and <mark4>endowed,</mark4><br>
Its senile <mark4>pleasure.</mark4><br>
