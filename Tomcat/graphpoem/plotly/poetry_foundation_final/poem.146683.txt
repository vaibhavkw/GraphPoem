Title : Great Ships <br>
Author : Adam Zagajewski <br><br>

This is a poem about the great ships that <mark4>wandered</mark4><br>
the <mark4>oceans</mark4><br>
And groaned sometimes in deep voices, grumbling about fog <br>
and submerged <mark4>peaks,</mark4><br>
But usually they sliced the pages of tropical <mark4>seas</mark4><br>
in <mark4>silence,</mark4><br>
Divided by height, category, and class, just like our <mark4>communities</mark4><br>
and <mark4>hotels.</mark4><br>
Beneath the deck poor emigrants played cards, and no <mark4>one</mark4><br>
<br>
While on the highest deck Claudel gazed at Yse and her <mark4>hair</mark4><br>
<br>
And toasts were raised to a safe trip, to <mark5>coming</mark5><br>
Toasts were raised, Alsatian wine and <mark4>champagne</mark4><br>
<br>
from France's finest <mark4>vineyards,</mark4><br>
Some days were static, windless, when only the light <mark4>seeped</mark4><br>
Days when nothing happened but the horizon, which <mark4>traveled</mark4><br>
<br>
                   with the ship, <br>
Days of emptiness and boredom, playing solitaire, <mark4>repeating</mark4><br>
the latest <mark4>news,</mark4><br>
Who'd been seen with whom in a tropical night's shade, <mark4>embracing</mark4><br>
beneath a peach-colored <mark4>moon.</mark4><br>
But filthy stokers tirelessly tossed coal into <mark4>open</mark4><br>
<br>
flaming <mark4>mouths</mark4><br>
And everything that is now already existed then, <mark4>but</mark4><br>
                  in condensed form. <br>
Our days already existed and our hearts <mark4>baked</mark4><br>
                   in the blazing stove, <br>
And the moment when I met you may also have <mark4>existed,</mark4><br>
and my <mark4>mistrust</mark4><br>
Brittle as a faience plate, and my faith, no less <mark4>frail</mark4><br>
and <mark4>capricious,</mark4><br>
And my searches for the final answer, my   <br>
disappointments and <mark4>discoveries.</mark4><br>
Great ships: some sunk suddenly, arousing <mark4>consciences</mark4><br>
<br>
and <mark4>fear,</mark4><br>
Gaining deathless fame, becoming <mark4>stars</mark4><br>
of special <mark4>bulletins.</mark4><br>
Others went peacefully, waned without a word in <mark4>provincial</mark4><br>
                ports, in dockyards, <br>
Beneath a coat of <mark1>rust</mark1>, a ruddy fur of rust, a slipcover of <mark3>rust,</mark3><br>
and <mark4>waited</mark4><br>
For the final transformation, the last judgment of souls <mark4>and</mark4><br>
They wait as patiently as chess players in Luxembourg <mark4>Garden</mark4><br>
<br>
                nudging pieces a fraction of an inch or so.<br>
