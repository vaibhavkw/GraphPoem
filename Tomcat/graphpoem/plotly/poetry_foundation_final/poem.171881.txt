Title : Beyond Hammonton <br>
Author : Stephen Dunn <br><br>

Night is longing, longing, longing, beyond all endurance.  --Henry <mark4>Miller</mark4><br>
The back roads I've traveled <mark4>late</mark4><br>
at night, alone, a little <mark4>drunk,</mark4><br>
wishing I were <mark4>someone</mark4><br>
on whom nothing is <mark4>lost,</mark4><br>
<br>
are the roads by day I <mark4>take</mark4><br>
to the car wash in Hammonton   <br>
or to Blue <mark4>Anchor's</mark4><br>
lawnmower repair shop <br>
when the self-propel mechanism <mark4>goes.</mark4><br>
<br>
Fascinating how the lamplight   <br>
that's <mark4>beckoned</mark4><br>
from solitary <mark4>windows</mark4><br>
gives way to white <mark4>shutters</mark4><br>
and occasionally a <mark4>woman</mark4><br>
in her yard, bending <mark4>over</mark4><br>
something conspicuously in <mark4>bloom.</mark4><br>
<br>
So much then is <mark1>duty</mark1>, duty, <mark1>duty,</mark1><br>
and so much <br>
with the sun visor <mark4>tilted</mark4><br>
and destination <mark4>known</mark4><br>
can be <mark4>endured.</mark4><br>
<br>
But at night . . . no, even at <mark4>night</mark4><br>
so much can be <mark1>endured.</mark1><br>
<br>
I've known only one <mark4>man</mark4><br>
who left the <mark4>road,</mark4><br>
followed an intriguing <mark3>light</mark3><br>
to its source. <br>
He told me <br>
that he knocked many <mark4>times</mark4><br>
before it became clear to <mark4>him</mark4><br>
he must break down the door.<br>
