Title : Portrait <br>
Author : Louise Bogan <br><br>

She has no need to fear the fall <br>
Of harvest from the laddered <mark3>reach</mark3><br>
Of orchards, nor the tide gone ebbing <br>
From the steep <mark3>beach.</mark3><br>
<br>
Nor hold to pain's effrontery <br>
Her body's bulwark, stern and <mark3>savage,</mark3><br>
Nor be a glass, where to forsee <br>
Another's <mark3>ravage.</mark3><br>
<br>
What she has gathered, and what lost, <br>
She will not find to lose <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
She is possessed by time, who once <br>
Was loved by <mark3>men.</mark3><br>
