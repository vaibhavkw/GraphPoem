Title : The Flight <br>
Author : Grace Schulman <br><br>

That day I hired a private detective to follow <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
and could not read his notes. In a tangled grove,   <br>
I hid behind white pines, compressed my <mark4>body,</mark4><br>
then watched him write, left-handed and <mark4>myopic,</mark4><br>
under an Irish <mark4>cap</mark4>, when I asked for <mark4>help</mark4><br>
from strangers who spoke Slavic <mark4>languages.</mark4><br>
Wary, moving ahead, I found a depot, <br>
watched an immense train churn, haloed in steam,   <br>
and boarded, second class. I had no <mark4>ticket,</mark4><br>
and my expired passport <mark4>represented</mark4><br>
a drooping head with unfamiliar <mark4>eyes.</mark4><br>
Unshaken, rows <mark4>behind</mark4>, the stranger <mark4>waited,</mark4><br>
wielding camera and pen. Across the <mark4>border</mark4><br>
I disembarked, but knew he would capture <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
with soundless footsteps, even on black <mark4>gravel.</mark4><br>
<br>
I tried to recall my crime. I know I am <mark4>guilty,</mark4><br>
but never why. Lawless, I have <mark4>ignored</mark4><br>
those signs: WRONG WAY; GO BACK and NO WAY <mark4>OUT,</mark4><br>
circles that tell me YOU ARE HERE. I <mark4>gather</mark4><br>
it is the whispers that explode, the looks <br>
that make dogs <mark4>whimper</mark4>, When I bow in <mark4>prayer</mark4><br>
I think of love; I know I've killed my <mark4>friends,</mark4><br>
pelting them with a touch--and yet I've <mark4>heard</mark4><br>
they are alive. Besides, that's not the <mark4>real</mark4><br>
<br>
offense. I would cross any path, or <mark4>trek</mark4><br>
through swamps to find my crime. But even <mark3>he,</mark3><br>
that bald, insistent man who follows <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
unsleeping, cannot tell me what I've done.<br>
