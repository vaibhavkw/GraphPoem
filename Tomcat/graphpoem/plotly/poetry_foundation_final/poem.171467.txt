Title : Love in the Weather's Bells <br>
Author : Jay Wright <br><br>

Snow <mark4>hurries</mark4><br>
the <mark4>strawberries</mark4><br>
from the bush. <br>
Star-wet water <mark4>rides</mark4><br>
you into summer,   <br>
into my autumn. <br>
Your cactus <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
are at my heart <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
Lady, I <mark4>court</mark4><br>
my dream of <mark3>you</mark3><br>
in lilies and in <mark3>rain.</mark3><br>
I vest <mark1>myself</mark1><br>
in your oldest <mark4>memory</mark4><br>
and in my oldest <mark4>need.</mark4><br>
And in my <mark4>passion</mark4><br>
you are the deepest <mark3>blue</mark3><br>
of the oldest <mark4>rose.</mark4><br>
Star circle me an axe.   <br>
I cannot cut <mark1>myself</mark1><br>
from any of your <mark4>emblems.</mark4><br>
It will soon be cold <mark1>here,</mark1><br>
and dark <mark1>here;</mark1><br>
the grass will lie <mark4>flat</mark4><br>
to search for its spring <mark4>head.</mark4><br>
I will bow <mark1>again</mark1><br>
in the winter of your <mark4>eyes.</mark4><br>
If there is music, <br>
it will be the weather's <mark4>bells</mark4><br>
to call me to the abandoned chapel <br>
of your simple <mark4>body.</mark4><br>
