Title : To the Young Wife <br>
Author : Charlotte Anna Perkins Gilman <br><br>

Are you content, you pretty three-years' <mark3>wife?</mark3><br>
Are you content and satisfied to <mark3>live</mark3><br>
On what your loving husband loves to <mark3>give,</mark3><br>
And give to him your <mark3>life?</mark3><br>
<br>
Are you content with work, ? to toil <mark4>alone,</mark4><br>
To clean things dirty and to soil things <mark4>clean;</mark4><br>
To be a kitchen-maid, be called a queen, <mark3>?</mark3><br>
Queen of a cook-stove <mark4>throne?</mark4><br>
<br>
Are you content to reign in that small space <mark3>--</mark3><br>
A wooden palace and a yard-fenced land <mark3>--</mark3><br>
With other queens abundant on each <mark3>hand,</mark3><br>
Each fastened in her <mark3>place?</mark3><br>
<br>
Are you content to rear your children <mark3>so?</mark3><br>
Untaught yourself, untrained, <mark4>perplexed</mark4>, <mark4>distressed,</mark4><br>
Are you so sure your way is always <mark3>best?</mark3><br>
That you can always <mark3>know?</mark3><br>
<br>
Have you forgotten how you used to <mark3>long</mark3><br>
In days of ardent girlhood, to be <mark4>great,</mark4><br>
To help the groaning world, to serve the <mark3>state,</mark3><br>
To be so wise ? so <mark3>strong?</mark3><br>
<br>
And are you quite convinced this is the <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
The only way a woman's duty lies <mark3>--</mark3><br>
Knowing all women so have shut their <mark3>eyes?</mark3><br>
Seeing the world <mark3>to-day?</mark3><br>
<br>
Having no dream of life in fuller <mark4>store?</mark4><br>
Of growing to be more than that you <mark4>are?</mark4><br>
Doing the things you know do better <mark3>far,</mark3><br>
Yet doing others - <mark4>more?</mark4><br>
<br>
Losing no love, but finding as you <mark5>grew</mark5><br>
That as you entered upon nobler <mark1>life</mark1><br>
You so became a richer, sweeter <mark1>wife,</mark1><br>
A wiser mother <mark3>too?</mark3><br>
<br>
What holds you? Ah, my dear, it is your <mark1>throne,</mark1><br>
Your paltry queenship in that narrow <mark1>place,</mark1><br>
Your antique labours, your restricted <mark1>space,</mark1><br>
Your working all <mark1>alone!</mark1><br>
<br>
Be not deceived! 'Tis not your wifely <mark4>bond</mark4><br>
That holds you, nor the mother's royal <mark3>power,</mark3><br>
But selfish, slavish service hour by hour <mark3>--</mark3><br>
A life with no <mark3>beyond!</mark3><br>
