Title : Medusa <br>
Author : Louise Bogan <br><br>

I had come to the house, in a cave of trees, <br>
Facing a sheer <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
Everything moved,--a bell hung ready to strike, <br>
Sun and reflection wheeled <mark3>by.</mark3><br>
<br>
When the bare eyes were before me <br>
And the hissing <mark4>hair,</mark4><br>
Held up at a window, seen through a <mark4>door.</mark4><br>
The stiff bald eyes, the serpents on the <mark4>forehead</mark4><br>
Formed in the <mark4>air.</mark4><br>
<br>
This is a dead scene forever now. <br>
Nothing will ever <mark3>stir.</mark3><br>
The end will never brighten it more than this, <br>
Nor the rain <mark3>blur.</mark3><br>
<br>
The water will always <mark1>fall</mark1>, and will not <mark1>fall,</mark1><br>
And the tipped bell make no <mark4>sound.</mark4><br>
The grass will always be growing for <mark3>hay</mark3><br>
Deep on the <mark3>ground.</mark3><br>
<br>
And I shall stand here like a shadow <br>
Under the great balanced <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
My eyes on the yellow dust, that was lifting in the <mark4>wind,</mark4><br>
And does not drift <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
