Title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 121 <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

Sad Hesper o'er the buried <mark3>sun</mark3><br>
And ready, thou, to die with <mark3>him,</mark3><br>
Thou watchest all things ever <mark3>dim</mark3><br>
And dimmer, and a glory <mark3>done:</mark3><br>
<br>
The team is loosen'd from the <mark4>wain,</mark4><br>
The boat is drawn upon the <mark3>shore;</mark3><br>
Thou listenest to the closing <mark3>door,</mark3><br>
And life is darken'd in the <mark3>brain.</mark3><br>
<br>
Bright Phosphor, fresher for the <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
By thee the world's great work is <mark3>heard</mark3><br>
Beginning, and the wakeful <mark3>bird;</mark3><br>
Behind thee comes the greater <mark3>light:</mark3><br>
<br>
The market boat is on the <mark4>stream,</mark4><br>
And voices hail it from the <mark3>brink;</mark3><br>
Thou hear'st the village hammer <mark3>clink,</mark3><br>
And see'st the moving of the <mark3>team.</mark3><br>
<br>
Sweet Hesper-Phosphor, double <mark4>name</mark4><br>
For what is one, the <mark4>first</mark4>, the <mark4>last,</mark4><br>
Thou, like my present and my <mark3>past,</mark3><br>
Thy place is changed; thou art the <mark3>same.</mark3><br>
