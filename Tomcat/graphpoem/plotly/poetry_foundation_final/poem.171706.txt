Title : The Last Man <br>
Author : Eleanor Wilner <br><br>

for Vivian <mark4>Schatz</mark4><br>
Here, in our familiar streets, the day   <br>
is brisk with winter's <mark4>business.</mark4><br>
The reassuring rows of brick <mark4>facades,</mark4><br>
litter baskets <mark4>overflowing</mark4><br>
with the harvest of the <mark4>streets</mark4><br>
and, when the light turns, the <mark4>people</mark4><br>
move in unison, the cars <mark4>miraculously</mark4><br>
slide to a stop, no one is killed,   <br>
the streets, for some reason, do not   <br>
show the blood that is <mark4>pouring</mark4><br>
like a tide, on other <mark4>shores.</mark4><br>
<br>
Martinez, the last peasant left <mark3>alive</mark3><br>
in his village, refuses to run, <mark4>hopes</mark4><br>
         that God, El Salvador, <br>
will let him get the harvest <mark3>in.</mark3><br>
"Can a fish live out of water?" he <mark4>says</mark4><br>
for why he <mark4>stays</mark4>, and <mark4>weeds</mark4><br>
another row, ignoring the <mark4>fins</mark4><br>
         of sharks that push up <br>
         through the furrows. <br>
<br>
Here, it is said, we <mark3>live</mark3><br>
in the belly of the beast. Ahab <mark4>sits</mark4><br>
forever at the helm, his <mark3>skin</mark3><br>
white wax, an effigy. The whale <mark4>carries</mark4><br>
him, lashed to its side by the <mark4>ropes</mark4><br>
from his own harpoon. His <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
are dead. His ivory leg <br>
juts from the flank of <mark4>Leviathan</mark4><br>
like a useless tooth. <br>
<br>
One more time, the distant sail <mark4>appears,</mark4><br>
a cloud forms, an old icon for <mark4>mercy</mark4><br>
         turned up in a dusty corner <br>
of the sky, preparing <mark4>rain</mark4><br>
for the parched land, <mark4>Rachel</mark4><br>
weeping for her children. "Can a <mark4>fish</mark4><br>
live out of water?" he <mark4>asks</mark4><br>
and the rain answers, in <mark4>Spanish,</mark4><br>
         manitas de plata <br>
         little hands of silver on his brow.<br>
