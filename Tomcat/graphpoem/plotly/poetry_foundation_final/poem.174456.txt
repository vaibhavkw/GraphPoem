Title : Amoretti LXXV: One Day I Wrote her Name <br>
Author : Edmund Spenser <br><br>

One day I wrote her name upon the <mark3>strand,</mark3><br>
But came the waves and washed it <mark3>away:</mark3><br>
Again I wrote it with a second <mark3>hand,</mark3><br>
But came the tide, and made my pains his <mark3>prey.</mark3><br>
"Vain man," said she, "that dost in vain assay,<br>
A mortal thing so to <mark4>immortalize;</mark4><br>
For I myself shall like to this <mark3>decay,</mark3><br>
And eke my name be wiped out <mark4>likewise."</mark4><br>
"Not so," (quod I) "let baser things <mark4>devise</mark4><br>
To die in dust, but you shall live by <mark3>fame:</mark3><br>
My verse your vertues rare shall eternize,<br>
And in the heavens write your glorious <mark3>name:</mark3><br>
Where whenas death shall all the world <mark3>subdue,</mark3><br>
Our love shall live, and later life <mark3>renew."</mark3><br>
