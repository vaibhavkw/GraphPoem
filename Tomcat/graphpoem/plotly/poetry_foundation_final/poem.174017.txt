Title : Sonnet 10: Lawrence, of virtuous father virtuous son <br>
Author : John Milton <br><br>

To Mr. <mark4>Lawrence</mark4><br>
Lawrence, of virtuous father virtuous <mark3>son,</mark3><br>
Now that the fields are dank, and ways are <mark3>mire,</mark3><br>
Where shall we sometimes meet, and by the <mark3>fire</mark3><br>
Help waste a sullen day; what may be <mark3>won</mark3><br>
From the hard season gaining? Time will <mark3>run</mark3><br>
On smoother, till Favonius <mark3>re-inspire</mark3><br>
The frozen earth, and clothe in fresh <mark3>attire</mark3><br>
The lily and rose, that neither sow'd nor <mark3>spun.</mark3><br>
What neat repast shall feast <mark4>us</mark4>, light and <mark4>choice,</mark4><br>
Of Attic taste, with wine, whence we may <mark3>rise</mark3><br>
To hear the lute well touch'd, or artful <mark3>voice</mark3><br>
Warble immortal notes and Tuscan <mark4>air?</mark4><br>
He who of those delights can judge, and <mark3>spare</mark3><br>
To interpose them oft, is not <mark3>unwise.</mark3><br>
