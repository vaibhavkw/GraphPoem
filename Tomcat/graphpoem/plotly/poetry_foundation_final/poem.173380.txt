Title : The Relic <br>
Author : John Donne <br><br>

When my grave is broke up <mark3>again</mark3><br>
Some second guest to <mark3>entertain,</mark3><br>
(For graves have learn'd that woman <mark3>head,</mark3><br>
To be to more than one a <mark3>bed)</mark3><br>
And he that digs it, <mark3>spies</mark3><br>
A bracelet of bright hair about the <mark4>bone,</mark4><br>
Will he not let'us <mark3>alone,</mark3><br>
And think that there a loving couple <mark3>lies,</mark3><br>
Who thought that this device might be some <mark3>way</mark3><br>
To make their souls, at the last busy <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
Meet at this grave, and make a little <mark3>stay?</mark3><br>
<br>
If this fall in a time, or <mark4>land,</mark4><br>
Where mis-devotion doth <mark3>command,</mark3><br>
Then he, that digs us up, will <mark3>bring</mark3><br>
Us to the bishop, and the <mark3>king,</mark3><br>
To make us relics; <mark4>then</mark4><br>
Thou shalt be a Mary Magdalen, and <mark3>I</mark3><br>
A something else <mark3>thereby;</mark3><br>
All women shall adore us, and some <mark3>men;</mark3><br>
And since at such time miracles are <mark3>sought,</mark3><br>
I would have that age by this paper <mark3>taught</mark3><br>
What miracles we harmless lovers <mark3>wrought.</mark3><br>
<br>
         First, we lov'd well and faithfully, <br>
Yet knew not what we lov'd, nor <mark3>why;</mark3><br>
Difference of sex no more we <mark3>knew</mark3><br>
Than our guardian angels <mark3>do;</mark3><br>
Coming and going, <mark3>we</mark3><br>
Perchance might kiss, but not between those <mark4>meals;</mark4><br>
Our hands ne'er touch'd the <mark3>seals</mark3><br>
Which nature, injur'd by late law, sets <mark3>free;</mark3><br>
These miracles we did, but now <mark3>alas,</mark3><br>
All measure, and all language, I should <mark3>pass,</mark3><br>
Should I tell what a miracle she <mark4>was.</mark4><br>
