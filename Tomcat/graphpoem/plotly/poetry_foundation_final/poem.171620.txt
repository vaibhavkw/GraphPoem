Title : A Happy Childhood <br>
Author : William Matthews <br><br>

Babies do not want to hear about babies; they like to be told of giants and castles.  Dr. Johnson  No one keeps a secret so well as a child  Victor Hugo<br>
My mother stands at the screen door, <mark4>laughing.</mark4><br>
"Out out damn Spot," she commands our silly <mark1>dog.</mark1><br>
I wonder what this means. I rise into adult <mark1>air</mark1><br>
<br>
like a hollyhock, I'm so proud to be <mark4>loved</mark4><br>
like this. The air is tight to my nervous <mark4>body.</mark4><br>
I use new clothes and shoes the way the <mark4>corn-studded</mark4><br>
<br>
soil around here uses nitrogen, giddily. <br>
Ohio, Ohio, Ohio. Often I <mark4>sing</mark4><br>
to myself all day like a fieldful of <mark4>August</mark4><br>
<br>
insects, just things I whisper, <mark4>really,</mark4><br>
a trance in sneakers. I'm <mark4>learning</mark4><br>
to read from my mother and soon I'll go to <mark4>school,</mark4><br>
<br>
I hate it when anyone dies or leaves and the <mark1>air</mark1><br>
goes slack around my body and I have to hug <mark4>myself,</mark4><br>
a cloud, an imaginary <mark4>friend</mark4>, the stream in the <mark4>road-</mark4><br>
<br>
side park. I love to be called for <mark4>dinner.</mark4><br>
Spot goes out and I go in and the <mark4>lights</mark4><br>
in the kitchen go on and the <mark1>dark,</mark1><br>
<br>
which also has a body like a <mark4>cloud's,</mark4><br>
leans lightly against the house. Tomorrow <br>
I'll find the sweatstains it left, little grey smudges. <br>
<br>
.       .       <mark1>.</mark1><br>
<br>
Here's a sky no higher than a <mark1>streetlamp,</mark1><br>
and a stack of morning papers cinched by <mark4>wire.</mark4><br>
It's 4:00 A.M. A stout dog, vaguely <mark4>beagle,</mark4><br>
<br>
minces over the dry, fresh-fallen <mark3>snow;</mark3><br>
and here's our sleep-sodden <mark5>paperboy</mark5><br>
with his pliers, his bike, his matronly <mark1>dog,</mark1><br>
<br>
his unclouding face set for paper <mark4>route</mark4><br>
like an alarm clock. Here's a <mark4>memory</mark4><br>
in the <mark4>making</mark4>, for this could be the <mark4>morning</mark4><br>
<br>
he doesn't come home and his <mark4>parents</mark4><br>
two hours later drive his route <mark4>until</mark4><br>
they find him asleep, propped against a <mark1>streetlamp,</mark1><br>
<br>
his papers all delivered and his dirty <mark4>paper-</mark4><br>
satchel slack, like an emptied <mark4>lung,</mark4><br>
and he blur-faced and iconic in the <mark1>morning</mark1><br>
<br>
air rinsing itself a paler and paler <mark3>blue</mark3><br>
through which a last few <mark4>dandruff-flecks</mark4><br>
of snow meander casually <mark4>down.</mark4><br>
<br>
The dog squeaks in out of the <mark1>dark,</mark1><br>
snuffling me too me too. And here he <mark4>goes</mark4><br>
home to memory, and to hot <mark4>chocolate</mark4><br>
<br>
on which no crinkled skin forms like infant <mark4>ice,</mark4><br>
and to the long and ordinary <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
school, two triumphs and one <mark4>severe</mark4><br>
<br>
humiliation on the playground, the <mark4>past</mark4><br>
already growing its scabs, the busride <mark4>home,</mark4><br>
dinner, and evening leading to <mark4>sleep</mark4><br>
<br>
like the slide that will spill him out, come <mark4>June,</mark4><br>
into the eye-reddening chlorine <mark4>waters</mark4><br>
of the municipal pool. Here he goes to <mark4>bed.</mark4><br>
<br>
Kiss. Kiss. Teeth. Prayers. <mark1>Dark</mark1>, <mark1>Dark.</mark1><br>
Here the dog lies down by his <mark1>bed,</mark1><br>
and sighs and farts. Will he always <mark4>be</mark4><br>
<br>
this skinny, <mark4>chicken-bones?</mark4><br>
He'll remember like a <mark4>prayer</mark4><br>
how his mother made breakfast for <mark4>him</mark4><br>
<br>
every morning before he trudged <mark4>out</mark4><br>
to snip the papers free. Just <mark4>as</mark4><br>
his mother will remember she <mark4>felt</mark4><br>
<br>
guilty never to wake up with <mark1>him</mark1><br>
to give him breakfast. It was <mark4>Cream</mark4><br>
of Wheat they always or never had <mark4>together.</mark4><br>
<br>
It turns out you are the story of your <mark4>childhood</mark4><br>
and you're under constant <mark4>revision,</mark4><br>
like a lonely folktale whose invisible <mark4>folks</mark4><br>
are all the selves you've been, <mark4>lifelong,</mark4><br>
<br>
shadows in fog, grey glimmers at <mark4>dusk.</mark4><br>
And each of these selves had a <mark1>childhood</mark1><br>
it traded for love and grudged to give <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
<br>
now lost irretrievably, in storage   <br>
like a set of dishes from which no <mark4>food,</mark4><br>
no Cream of Wheat, no rabbit in <mark4>mustard</mark4><br>
<br>
sauce, nor even a single <mark4>raspberry,</mark4><br>
can be eaten until the <mark4>afterlife,</mark4><br>
which is only childhood in its <mark4>last</mark4><br>
<br>
disguise, all radiance or all <mark4>humiliation,</mark4><br>
and so it is forfeit a final <mark4>time.</mark4><br>
In fact it was awful, you think, or why   <br>
<br>
should the piecework of grief be <mark4>endless?</mark4><br>
Only because death is, and likewise <mark4>loss,</mark4><br>
which is not awful, but only <mark4>breathtaking.</mark4><br>
<br>
There's no truth about your <mark1>childhood,</mark1><br>
though there's a story, yours to <mark4>tend,</mark4><br>
like a fire or <mark4>garden</mark4>, Make it a good <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
<br>
since you'll have to live it out, and <mark4>all</mark4><br>
its revisions, so long as you all shall live, <br>
for they shall be gathered to your <mark4>deathbed,</mark4><br>
<br>
and they'll have known to what you and <mark3>they</mark3><br>
would come, and this one time they'll weep for <mark3>you.</mark3><br>
The map in the shopping center has an <mark4>X</mark4><br>
<br>
signed "you are here." A dream is like <mark4>that.</mark4><br>
In a dream you are never eighty, <mark3>though</mark3><br>
you may risk death by other <mark4>means:</mark4><br>
you're on a ledge and memory calls <mark1>you</mark1><br>
<br>
to jump, but a deft cop talks you <mark4>in</mark4><br>
to a small, bright room, and <mark4>snickers.</mark4><br>
And in a dream, you're everyone <mark4>somewhat,</mark4><br>
<br>
but not wholly. I think I know how <mark1>that</mark1><br>
works: for twenty-one years I had a <mark4>father</mark4><br>
and then I became a father, replacing <mark1>him</mark1><br>
<br>
but not really. Soon my sons will be <mark4>fathers.</mark4><br>
Surely, that's what middle-aged <mark1>means,</mark1><br>
being father and son to sons and <mark1>father.</mark1><br>
<br>
That a male has only one mother is <mark4>another</mark4><br>
<mark4>story</mark4>, told wherever men weep <mark4>wholly.</mark4><br>
Though nobody's replaced. In one <mark4>dream</mark4><br>
<br>
I'm leading a rope of children to <mark4>safety,</mark4><br>
through a snowy farm. The farmer comes <mark1>out</mark1><br>
and I have to throw snowballs well to <mark1>him</mark1><br>
<br>
so we may pass. Even dreaming, I <mark3>know</mark3><br>
he's my father, at ease in his <mark4>catcher's</mark4><br>
squat, and that the dream has <mark4>revived</mark4><br>
<br>
to us both an old unspoken <mark4>fantasy:</mark4><br>
we're a battery. I'm young, I'm brash,   <br>
I don't know how to pitch but I <mark4>can</mark4><br>
<br>
throw a lamb chop past a wolf. And <mark3>he</mark3><br>
can handle pitchers and control a <mark4>game.</mark4><br>
I look to him for a sign. I'd <mark4>nod</mark4><br>
<br>
for anything. The damn thing is hard to <mark4>grip</mark4><br>
without seams, and I don't rely <mark4>only</mark4><br>
on my live, young arm, but throw by <mark1>all</mark1><br>
<br>
the body I can get behind it, and it <mark4>fluffs</mark4><br>
toward him no faster than the <mark1>snow</mark1><br>
in the dream drifts down. <mark4>Nothing</mark4><br>
<br>
takes forever, but I know what the <mark4>phrase</mark4><br>
means. The children grow more <mark4>cold</mark4><br>
and hungry and cruel to each <mark3>other</mark3><br>
<br>
the longer the ball's in the air, and it <mark4>begins</mark4><br>
to melt. By the time it gets to him we'll <mark1>be</mark1><br>
our waking ages, and each of us is <mark4>himself</mark4><br>
<br>
alone, and we all join hands and <mark3>go.</mark3><br>
.       .       <mark1>.</mark1><br>
Toward dawn, rain explodes on the tin <mark4>roof</mark4><br>
<br>
like popcorn. The pale light is streaked by <mark3>grey</mark3><br>
<br>
and that green you see just under the <mark4>surface</mark4><br>
of <mark4>water</mark4>, a shimmer more than a <mark4>color.</mark4><br>
Time to dive back into sleep, as if <mark3>into</mark3><br>
<br>
happiness, that neglected discipline <mark4>....</mark4><br>
In those sixth-grade book <mark4>reports</mark4><br>
you had to say if the book was <mark4>optimistic</mark4><br>
<br>
or not, and everyone looked at <mark1>you</mark1><br>
the same way: how would he turn <mark1>out?</mark1><br>
He rolls in his sleep like an <mark4>otter.</mark4><br>
<br>
Uncle Ed has a neck so fat it's <mark4>funny,</mark4><br>
and on the way to work he pries the <mark4>cap</mark4><br>
off a <mark4>Pepsi</mark4>, Damn rain didn't cool one <mark4>weary</mark4><br>
<br>
thing for long; it's gonna be a <mark4>cooker.</mark4><br>
The boy sleeps with a thin chain of <mark4>sweat</mark4><br>
on his upper lip, as if waking <mark4>itself,</mark4><br>
<br>
becoming explicit, were hard <mark4>work.</mark4><br>
Who knows if he's happy or <mark4>not?</mark4><br>
A child is all the tools a child <mark4>has,</mark4><br>
<br>
growing up, who makes what he <mark1>can.</mark1><br>
