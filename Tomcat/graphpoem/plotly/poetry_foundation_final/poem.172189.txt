Title : Ritual One <br>
Author : David Ignatow <br><br>

As I enter the theatre the play is going <mark4>on.</mark4><br>
I hear the father say to the son on <mark1>stage,</mark1><br>
You've taken the motor <mark4>apart.</mark4><br>
The son replies, The roof is <mark4>leaking.</mark4><br>
The father retorts, The tire is <mark4>flat.</mark4><br>
Tiptoeing down the aisle, I find my <mark4>seat,</mark4><br>
edge my way in across a dozen <mark4>kneecaps</mark4><br>
as I tremble for my sanity. <br>
I have heard doomed voices calling on god the <mark4>electrode.</mark4><br>
Sure enough, as I start to <mark4>sit</mark4><br>
a scream rises from beneath me. <br>
It is one of the <mark4>players.</mark4><br>
If I come down, I'll break his neck, <br>
caught between the seat and the <mark4>backrest.</mark4><br>
Now the audience and the players on <mark1>stage,</mark1><br>
their heads turned towards me, are <mark4>waiting</mark4><br>
for the sound of the break. Must I? <br>
Those in my aisle nod slowly, reading my <mark4>mind,</mark4><br>
their eyes fixed on me, and I <mark4>understand</mark4><br>
that each has done the <mark4>same.</mark4><br>
Must I kill this man as the price of my <mark4>admission</mark4><br>
to this play? His screams continue loud and <mark4>long.</mark4><br>
I am at a loss as to what to <mark3>do,</mark3><br>
I panic, I <mark4>freeze.</mark4><br>
<br>
My training has been to eat the flesh of pig.   <br>
I might even have been able to slit a <mark4>throat.</mark4><br>
As a child I witnessed the dead <mark4>chickens</mark4><br>
over a barrel of sawdust absorbing their <mark4>blood.</mark4><br>
I then brought them in a bag to my <mark4>father</mark4><br>
who sold them across his counter. Liking <mark4>him,</mark4><br>
I learned to like people and enjoy their company <mark3>too,</mark3><br>
which of course brought me to this <mark5>play.</mark5><br>
But how angry I <mark4>become.</mark4><br>
Now everybody is shouting at me to sit <mark4>down,</mark4><br>
sit down or I'll be thrown <mark4>out.</mark4><br>
The father and son have stepped off <mark1>stage</mark1><br>
and come striding down the aisle side by <mark4>side.</mark4><br>
They reach me, grab me by the <mark4>shoulder</mark4><br>
and force me down. I <mark1>scream</mark1>, I <mark4>scream,</mark4><br>
as if to cover the sound of the neck <mark4>breaking.</mark4><br>
<br>
All through the play I <mark1>scream</mark1><br>
and am invited on stage to take a <mark1>bow.</mark1><br>
I lose my senses and kick the actors in the <mark4>teeth.</mark4><br>
<br>
There is more <mark4>laughter</mark4><br>
and the actors acknowledge my performance with a <mark1>bow.</mark1><br>
How should I understand <mark4>this?</mark4><br>
Is it to say that if I machine-gun the <mark4>theatre</mark4><br>
from left to right they will respond with <mark4>applause</mark4><br>
that would only gradually diminish with each <mark4>death?</mark4><br>
I wonder then whether logically I should kill myself   <br>
too out of admiration. A question <mark4>indeed,</mark4><br>
as I return to my seat and observe a new <mark4>act</mark4><br>
of children playfully aiming their <mark4>kicks</mark4><br>
at each other's <mark4>groins.</mark4><br>
