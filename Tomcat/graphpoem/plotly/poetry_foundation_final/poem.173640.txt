Title : Virtue <br>
Author : George Herbert <br><br>

Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so <mark3>bright,</mark3><br>
The bridal of the earth and <mark3>sky;</mark3><br>
The dew shall weep thy fall <mark3>to-night,</mark3><br>
For thou must <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
<br>
Sweet rose, whose hue angry and <mark3>brave</mark3><br>
Bids the rash gazer wipe his <mark3>eye;</mark3><br>
Thy root is ever in its <mark3>grave,</mark3><br>
And thou must <mark1>die.</mark1><br>
<br>
Sweet spring, full of sweet days and <mark3>roses,</mark3><br>
A box where sweets compacted <mark3>lie;</mark3><br>
My music shows ye have your <mark3>closes,</mark3><br>
And all must <mark1>die.</mark1><br>
<br>
Only a sweet and virtuous <mark3>soul,</mark3><br>
Like season'd timber, never <mark4>gives;</mark4><br>
But though the whole world turn to <mark3>coal,</mark3><br>
Then chiefly <mark3>lives.</mark3><br>
