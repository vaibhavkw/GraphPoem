Title : From the Notebooks of Anne Verveine <br>
Author : Rosanna Warren <br><br>

<br>
When his dogs leapt on Actaeon, <mark3>he</mark3><br>
cried (did he cry out?)--He <mark4>flung</mark4><br>
his arm to <mark3>command</mark3>, they tore his <mark3>hand</mark3><br>
<br>
from the wrist stump, <mark4>tore</mark4><br>
guts from his belly through the tunic, <mark4>ripped</mark4><br>
<br>
the cry from his <mark4>throat.</mark4><br>
That's how we know a god, when the <mark4>facts</mark4><br>
<br>
leap at the tenderest innards, and we <mark3>know</mark3><br>
the god is what we can't change. <mark3>You</mark3><br>
<br>
stood over me as I woke, I opened my eyes, I saw <br>
that I'd seen and that it was <mark3>too</mark3><br>
<br>
late: the <mark4>seeing</mark4><br>
of you in the doorway with weak electric <mark4>light</mark4><br>
<br>
fanning behind you in the hall, and my room and narrow pallet steeped in <mark3>shadow</mark3><br>
were what I couldn't change, and <mark1>distantly</mark1><br>
<br>
I wanted you, and, as <mark1>distantly,</mark1><br>
I heard the dogs, <mark4>baying.</mark4><br>
<br>
And yet the fountain spends itself, and it <mark4>is</mark4><br>
<br>
in the <mark4>clear</mark4><br>
<br>
light of its losing that we <mark5>seem</mark5><br>
to take <mark3>delight:</mark3><br>
you dipped your hand in its running <mark4>braid</mark4><br>
<br>
to sprinkle my forehead, my <mark4>lips.</mark4><br>
Garden deities observed us: three <mark4>nymphs</mark4><br>
<br>
with moss staining their haunches, a pug-nosed faun. <br>
The wound in water <mark4>closed</mark4><br>
<br>
perfectly around your gesture, erasing <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
so that only the glimmer, <mark5>swiftly</mark5><br>
<br>
drying, on my face <mark4>recalled</mark4><br>
our <mark4>interruption</mark4><br>
<br>
of the faultless, cold, passionate, <mark4>perpetual</mark4><br>
idea of the stream's <mark4>descent--</mark4><br>
<br>
which, unlike ours, would always be <mark4>renewed.</mark4><br>
I kissed a flame, what did I <mark4>expect.</mark4><br>
<br>
Those days, you painted in fire. Tangerine, <mark4>gold:</mark4><br>
one would have had to be a pilgrim to <mark4>walk</mark4><br>
<br>
through that wall of molten <mark4>glass.</mark4><br>
<br>
And <mark4>purification</mark4><br>
could be conceived, if <mark4>not</mark4><br>
<br>
attained, only after many <mark4>years,</mark4><br>
in autumn, in a fire greater than <mark4>yours,</mark4><br>
though menstrual blood still tinged the <mark4>threshold</mark4><br>
<br>
and our ex-votos were sordid--scraps of blistered <mark4>flesh</mark4><br>
taped to kitsch prayer cards--and neither of us <mark3>knew</mark3><br>
the object of this exercise, <mark4>except</mark4><br>
<br>
having, inadvertently, each of us, <mark4>burned</mark4><br>
we recognized the <mark4>smell</mark4><br>
of wood smoke, the slow <mark4>swirl</mark4><br>
<br>
flakes of wood ash make in heavy <mark4>air;</mark4><br>
and we were ready, each in a private way, to <mark4>make</mark4><br>
the gifts the season <mark4>required.</mark4><br>
<br>
Mine was the <mark4>scene</mark4><br>
of my young self in your <mark4>arms,</mark4><br>
eyes in your eyes, clutched in the <mark4>effort</mark4><br>
<br>
to give each other away--when I <mark4>glimpsed</mark4><br>
behind your pleasure, fear; <mark4>behind</mark4><br>
fear, anger; and <mark1>knew</mark1><br>
<br>
in a bolt some <mark4>gifts</mark4><br>
conceal a greater <mark4>gift.</mark4><br>
I have kept it. Now I am ready to give it <mark4>back</mark4><br>
<br>
into darker <mark4>flame</mark4><br>
in this season of <mark4>goldenrod</mark4>, the ardent <mark4>weed,</mark4><br>
and Queen Anne's lace in its mantilla of <mark4>ash.</mark4><br>
<br>
And yet, how lumpishly, how stupidly I <mark4>stand.</mark4><br>
How much that is human will never <mark4>burn.</mark4><br>
And if you should <mark4>answer?</mark4><br>
<br>
I listened, years before I knew you, to the <mark4>whine</mark4><br>
of wind through the high stony pastures above my childhood village; <br>
I breathed lavender and thyme and burned my bare <mark4>legs</mark4><br>
<br>
on nettles, scraped them on thistles, and <mark4>rubbed</mark4><br>
<br>
the sore skin till it reddened all the more. When <mark3>we</mark3><br>
<br>
walked the uplands together, you burned your <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
and I kissed the crimsoning nettle-rash. "We are the Lords of <mark4>need,"</mark4><br>
you said Hafiz <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
and I believed you, and we were. <br>
<br>
In the rugs of your country, carmine is <mark4>crushed</mark4><br>
from insects, cochineal; saffron <mark1>gold</mark1><br>
is boiled from crocus stamens; and <mark3>indigo</mark3><br>
<br>
of heaven and fountain pools is soaked, hours upon <mark4>hours,</mark4><br>
from indigo leaves. "Like the angel Harut," <br>
you said, "We are in the calamity of <mark4>love-desire."</mark4><br>
<br>
The angel is chained by neck and knees, head down, in the pit of <mark4>Babel</mark4><br>
for falling in love. Your <mark4>carpets</mark4><br>
told a different story: scarlet and <mark4>saffron</mark4><br>
<br>
blush as in Paradise, and God reveals himself <br>
in wine, flame, tulips, and the light in a mortal <mark3>eye.</mark3><br>
All night you held me, <mark4>sleepless</mark4>, on my childhood cot in the stone <mark4>house;</mark4><br>
<br>
all night the wind seethed through crags and twisted olive <mark4>trees,</mark4><br>
high on the scents of thyme and goat droppings. "All <mark4>night,"</mark4><br>
Hafiz sang, "I hope the breeze of dawn will cherish the <mark4>lovers."</mark4><br>
<br>
But the breeze of dawn is the angel of <mark4>death.</mark4><br>
You are in your far landscape now, I am in <mark4>mine:</mark4><br>
the wind complains and I can't understand the <mark4>words.</mark4><br>
<br>
And if you should <mark1>answer?</mark1><br>
You, ten years away, in a different <mark4>wind.</mark4><br>
"We are in the calamity," Hafiz sang. "But tell the <mark4>tale</mark4><br>
<br>
of the minstrel and of wine, and leave time alone. <mark4>Time</mark4><br>
is a mystery no skill will solve." We <mark4>should</mark4><br>
thread words like pearls, you said, and the grateful <mark3>sky</mark3><br>
<br>
would scatter the Pleiades upon <mark4>us</mark4><br>
though we couldn't see, and that was long <mark3>ago.</mark3><br>
The carpet is not a story. It is a <mark4>place,</mark4><br>
<br>
garden of crisscrossed pathways, <mark4>labyrinth,</mark4><br>
fountain, pool, and <mark4>stream.</mark4><br>
As though the fabric had ripped at the vanishing <mark4>point</mark4><br>
<br>
at the top of the <mark4>street</mark4><br>
of ashen facades and slate-sloped roofs, you <mark4>stepped</mark4><br>
through the gap, out of your own <mark4>world.</mark4><br>
<br>
I had already lost my <mark1>world.</mark1><br>
<br>
We met in a torn <mark3>design</mark3><br>
which we tore further, pulling the tall warp, <br>
thread wrapped tightly around our fingers until it bit the <mark1>flesh</mark1><br>
and the rue de Lille unravelled. <br>
<br>
I know about design: it's my <mark1>job,</mark1><br>
arranging other people's letters in star <mark4>charts</mark4><br>
that phosphoresce in the dark between the closed covers of <mark4>books.</mark4><br>
<br>
You knew about design from the <mark4>holes</mark4><br>
blown through your <mark4>country.</mark4><br>
We spoke in a language of no country on <mark4>earth.</mark4><br>
<br>
You moved slowly, in shadow, teaching the <mark4>shadows</mark4><br>
to echo my name. You ripped my shirt at the <mark4>neck.</mark4><br>
Was it The Beloved I held, holding <mark1>you?</mark1><br>
<br>
Down the middle of the carpet the <mark4>river</mark4><br>
weaves a thousand gray glimmers into the deeper <mark4>green.</mark4><br>
The river knows about mourning; that's its <mark1>job.</mark1><br>
<br>
How many years has it practiced? With such fleet fingers. A <mark4>man</mark4><br>
woke me at dawn this morning, sobbing and cursing in the <mark1>street,</mark1><br>
reeling from sidewalk to gutter and back <mark4>again.</mark4><br>
<br>
On my long gray street, the rue de Lille, where I still live.<br>
