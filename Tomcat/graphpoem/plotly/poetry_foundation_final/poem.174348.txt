Title : The Cremation of Sam McGee <br>
Author : Robert W. Service <br><br>

There are strange things done in the midnight <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
By the men who moil for <mark3>gold;</mark3><br>
The Arctic trails have their secret <mark4>tales</mark4><br>
That would make your blood run <mark3>cold;</mark3><br>
The Northern Lights have seen queer <mark4>sights,</mark4><br>
But the queerest they ever did <mark3>see</mark3><br>
Was that night on the marge of Lake <mark1>Lebarge</mark1><br>
I cremated Sam <mark3>McGee.</mark3><br>
<br>
Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee, where the cotton blooms and <mark4>blows.</mark4><br>
Why he left his home in the South to roam 'round the Pole, God only <mark3>knows.</mark3><br>
He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a <mark3>spell;</mark3><br>
Though he'd often say in his homely way that "he'd sooner live in <mark3>hell."</mark3><br>
<br>
On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson <mark4>trail.</mark4><br>
Talk of your cold! through the parka's fold it stabbed like a driven <mark3>nail.</mark3><br>
If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldn't <mark1>see;</mark1><br>
It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam <mark1>McGee.</mark1><br>
<br>
And that very night, as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the <mark3>snow,</mark3><br>
And the dogs were fed, and the stars o'erhead were dancing heel and <mark3>toe,</mark3><br>
He turned to me, and "Cap," says he, "I'll cash in this trip, I <mark4>guess;</mark4><br>
And if I do, I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request."<br>
<br>
Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no; then he says with a sort of <mark4>moan:</mark4><br>
"It's the cursed cold, and it's got right hold till I'm chilled clean through to the <mark3>bone.</mark3><br>
Yet 'tain't being dead--it's my awful dread of the icy grave that <mark4>pains;</mark4><br>
So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last <mark3>remains."</mark3><br>
<br>
A pal's last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not <mark3>fail;</mark3><br>
And we started on at the streak of dawn; but God! he looked ghastly <mark3>pale.</mark3><br>
He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day of his home in <mark3>Tennessee;</mark3><br>
And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam <mark1>McGee.</mark1><br>
<br>
There wasn't a breath in that land of death, and I hurried, <mark4>horror-driven,</mark4><br>
With a corpse half hid that I couldn't get rid, because of a promise <mark3>given;</mark3><br>
It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say: "You may tax your brawn and <mark3>brains,</mark3><br>
But you promised true, and it's up to you to cremate those last <mark1>remains."</mark1><br>
<br>
Now a promise made is a debt <mark4>unpaid</mark4>, and the trail has its own stern <mark4>code.</mark4><br>
In the days to come, though my lips were dumb, in my heart how I cursed that <mark3>load.</mark3><br>
In the long, long night, by the lone firelight, while the huskies, round in a <mark3>ring,</mark3><br>
Howled out their woes to the homeless snows-- O God! how I loathed the <mark3>thing.</mark3><br>
<br>
And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier <mark3>grow;</mark3><br>
And on I went, though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting <mark3>low;</mark3><br>
The trail was bad, and I felt half mad, but I swore I would not give <mark3>in;</mark3><br>
And I'd often sing to the hateful thing, and it hearkened with a <mark3>grin.</mark3><br>
<br>
Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge, and a derelict there <mark3>lay;</mark3><br>
It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a trice it was called the "Alice <mark3>May."</mark3><br>
And I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen <mark4>chum;</mark4><br>
Then "Here," said I, with a sudden cry, "is my cre-ma-tor-eum."<br>
<br>
Some planks I tore from the cabin <mark4>floor</mark4>, and I lit the boiler <mark4>fire;</mark4><br>
Some coal I found that was lying around, and I heaped the fuel <mark3>higher;</mark3><br>
The flames just soared, and the furnace roared--such a blaze you seldom <mark1>see;</mark1><br>
And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal, and I stuffed in Sam <mark1>McGee.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then I made a hike, for I didn't like to hear him sizzle <mark3>so;</mark3><br>
And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled, and the wind began to <mark3>blow.</mark3><br>
It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks, and I don't know <mark3>why;</mark3><br>
And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
<br>
I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly <mark4>fear;</mark4><br>
But the stars came out and they danced about ere again I ventured <mark3>near;</mark3><br>
I was sick with <mark4>dread</mark4>, but I bravely said: "I'll just take a peep <mark4>inside.</mark4><br>
I guess he's cooked, and it's time I looked"; ... then the door I opened <mark3>wide.</mark3><br>
<br>
And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the furnace <mark4>roar;</mark4><br>
And he wore a smile you could see a mile, and he said: "Please close that <mark3>door.</mark3><br>
It's fine in here, but I greatly fear you'll let in the cold and <mark4>storm--</mark4><br>
Since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee, it's the first time I've been <mark3>warm."</mark3><br>
<br>
There are strange things done in the midnight <mark1>sun</mark1><br>
By the men who moil for <mark1>gold;</mark1><br>
The Arctic trails have their secret <mark1>tales</mark1><br>
