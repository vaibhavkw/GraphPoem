Title : Mingus in Diaspora <br>
Author : William Matthews <br><br>

You could say, I suppose, that he ate his way <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
like the prisoner who starts a tunnel with a <mark4>spoon,</mark4><br>
or you could say he was one in whom nothing was <mark4>lost,</mark4><br>
who took it all in, or that he was big as a <mark4>bus.</mark4><br>
<br>
He would say, and he <mark4>did</mark4>, in one of those <mark4>blurred</mark4><br>
melismatic slaloms his sentences ran--for all <br>
the music was in his speech: swift switches of tempo,   <br>
stop-time, double time (he could talk in 6/8), <br>
<br>
"I just ruined my body." And there, Exhibit A,   <br>
it stood, that Parthenon of fat, the tenant <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
lifted, as we say, since words are a weight, and <mark4>music.</mark4><br>
Silence is lighter than air, for the air we <mark1>know</mark1><br>
<br>
rises but to the edge of the atmosphere. <br>
You have to pick up The Bass, as Mingus <mark4>called</mark4><br>
his, with audible <mark4>capitals</mark4>, and think of the slow <mark4>years</mark4><br>
the wood spent as a tree, which might well have <mark4>been</mark4><br>
<br>
enough for wood, and think of the skill the bassmaker   <br>
carried without great thought of it from <mark4>home</mark4><br>
to the shop and back for decades, and <mark1>know</mark1><br>
what bassists before you have played, and <mark1>know</mark1><br>
<br>
how much of this is stored in The Bass like energy   <br>
in a spring and know how much you must coax <mark1>out.</mark1><br>
How easy it would be, <mark4>instead</mark4>, to pull a <mark4>sword</mark4><br>
from a stone. But what's inside the bass wants <mark1>out,</mark1><br>
<br>
the way one day you will. Religious stories are rich   <br>
in symmetry. You must release as much of this <mark3>hoard</mark3><br>
as you can, little by little, in perfect <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
as the work of the body becomes a body of <mark4>work.</mark4><br>
