Title : The Divine Image <br>
Author : William Blake <br><br>

To Mercy, Pity, Peace, and <mark1>Love</mark1><br>
All pray in their <mark4>distress;</mark4><br>
And to these virtues of <mark4>delight</mark4><br>
Return their thankfulness.<br>
<br>
For Mercy, Pity, Peace, and <mark1>Love</mark1><br>
Is God, our father <mark4>dear,</mark4><br>
And Mercy, Pity, Peace, and <mark1>Love</mark1><br>
Is Man, his child and <mark4>care.</mark4><br>
<br>
For Mercy has a human <mark4>heart,</mark4><br>
Pity a human <mark4>face,</mark4><br>
And Love, the human form <mark1>divine,</mark1><br>
And <mark4>Peace</mark4>, the human <mark4>dress.</mark4><br>
<br>
Then every man, of every clime,<br>
That prays in his <mark1>distress,</mark1><br>
Prays to the human form <mark1>divine,</mark1><br>
Love, Mercy, Pity, <mark4>Peace.</mark4><br>
<br>
And all must love the human form,<br>
In heathen, Turk, or <mark3>Jew;</mark3><br>
Where Mercy, Love, and Pity dwell<br>
There God is dwelling <mark3>too.</mark3><br>
