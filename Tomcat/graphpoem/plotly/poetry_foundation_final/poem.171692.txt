Title : Tapestry <br>
Author : Charles Simic <br><br>

It hangs from heaven to earth. <br>
There are trees in it, <mark4>cities</mark4>, <mark4>rivers,</mark4><br>
small pigs and moons. In one corner <br>
the snow falling over a charging cavalry,   <br>
in another women are planting <mark4>rice.</mark4><br>
<br>
You can also see: <br>
a chicken carried off by a <mark4>fox,</mark4><br>
a naked couple on their wedding <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
a column of <mark4>smoke,</mark4><br>
an evil-eyed woman spitting into a pail of <mark4>milk.</mark4><br>
<br>
What is behind <mark4>it?</mark4><br>
<mark1>--Space</mark1>, plenty of empty <mark4>space.</mark4><br>
<br>
And who is talking now? <br>
--A man asleep under his <mark4>hat.</mark4><br>
<br>
What happens when he wakes <mark4>up?</mark4><br>
--He'll go into a <mark4>barbershop.</mark4><br>
They'll shave his beard, nose, ears, and hair,   <br>
To make him look like everyone <mark4>else.</mark4><br>
