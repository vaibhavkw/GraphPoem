Title : Paradise Regain'd: Book 1 (1671 version) <br>
Author : John Milton <br><br>

I Who e're while the happy Garden <mark4>sung,</mark4><br>
By one mans disobedience lost, now <mark4>sing</mark4><br>
Recover'd Paradise to all <mark4>mankind,</mark4><br>
By one mans firm obedience fully <mark4>tri'd</mark4><br>
Through all temptation, and the Tempter <mark4>foil'd</mark4><br>
In all his wiles, defeated and <mark5>repuls't,</mark5><br>
And Eden rais'd in the wast <mark4>Wilderness.</mark4><br>
   Thou Spirit who ledst this glorious Eremite <br>
Into the Desert, his Victorious <mark4>Field</mark4><br>
Against the Spiritual Foe, and broughtst him <mark4>thence</mark4><br>
By proof the undoubted Son of God, <mark4>inspire,</mark4><br>
As thou art <mark4>wont</mark4>, my prompted Song else <mark4>mute,</mark4><br>
And bear through highth or depth of natures <mark4>bounds</mark4><br>
With prosperous wing full summ'd to tell of <mark4>deeds</mark4><br>
Above Heroic, though in secret <mark4>done,</mark4><br>
And unrecorded left through many an <mark3>Age,</mark3><br>
Worthy t'have not remain'd so long <mark4>unsung.</mark4><br>
Now had the great Proclaimer with a <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
More awful then the sound of Trumpet, cri'd <br>
Repentance, and Heavens Kingdom nigh at <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
To all Baptiz'd: to his great Baptism <mark4>flock'd</mark4><br>
With aw the Regions round, and with them <mark4>came</mark4><br>
From Nazareth the Son of Joseph <mark4>deem'd</mark4><br>
To the flood Jordan, came as then <mark4>obscure,</mark4><br>
Unmarkt, <mark4>unknown</mark4>, but him the Baptist <mark4>soon</mark4><br>
Descri'd, divinely warn'd, and witness <mark4>bore</mark4><br>
As to his worthier, and would have <mark4>resign'd</mark4><br>
To him his Heavenly Office, nor was <mark4>long</mark4><br>
His witness unconfirm'd: on him <mark1>baptiz'd</mark1><br>
Heaven open'd, and in likeness of a <mark4>Dove</mark4><br>
The Spirit descended, while the Fathers <mark1>voice</mark1><br>
From Heav'n pronounc'd him his beloved <mark4>Son.</mark4><br>
That heard the Adversary, who roving <mark4>still</mark4><br>
About the world, at that assembly fam'd <br>
Would not be last, and with the voice <mark4>divine</mark4><br>
Nigh Thunder-struck, th' exalted man, to <mark4>whom</mark4><br>
Such high attest was giv'n, a while <mark4>survey'd</mark4><br>
With wonder, then with envy fraught and <mark3>rage</mark3><br>
Flies to his place, nor rests, but in mid <mark4>air</mark4><br>
To Councel summons all his mighty <mark4>Peers,</mark4><br>
Within thick Clouds and dark ten-fold <mark5>involv'd,</mark5><br>
A gloomy Consistory; and them <mark4>amidst</mark4><br>
With looks agast and sad he thus bespake. <br>
O ancient Powers of Air and this wide <mark4>world,</mark4><br>
For much more willingly I mention <mark1>Air,</mark1><br>
This our old Conquest, then remember <mark4>Hell</mark4><br>
Our hated habitation; well ye <mark3>know</mark3><br>
How many Ages, as the years of <mark4>men,</mark4><br>
This Universe we have possest, and <mark5>rul'd</mark5><br>
In manner at our will th' affairs of <mark1>Earth,</mark1><br>
Since Adam and his facil consort <mark4>Eve</mark4><br>
Lost Paradise deceiv'd by me, though <mark4>since</mark4><br>
With dread attending when that fatal <mark4>wound</mark4><br>
Shall be inflicted by the Seed of <mark1>Eve</mark1><br>
Upon my head, long the decrees of <mark1>Heav'n</mark1><br>
Delay, for longest time to him is <mark4>short;</mark4><br>
And now too soon for us the circling <mark4>hours</mark4><br>
This dreaded time have compast, wherein <mark3>we</mark3><br>
Must bide the stroak of that long threatn'd <mark1>wound,</mark1><br>
At least if so we can, and by the <mark4>head</mark4><br>
Broken be not intended all our <mark4>power</mark4><br>
To be infring'd, our freedom and our <mark4>being.</mark4><br>
In this fair Empire won of Earth and <mark1>Air;</mark1><br>
For this ill news I bring, the Womans <mark4>seed</mark4><br>
Destin'd to this, is late of woman <mark4>born,</mark4><br>
His birth to our just fear gave no small <mark4>cause,</mark4><br>
But his growth now to youths full flowr, <mark4>displaying</mark4><br>
All vertue, grace and wisdom to atchieve <br>
Things highest, greatest, multiplies my <mark4>fear.</mark4><br>
Before him a great Prophet, to <mark4>proclaim</mark4><br>
His coming, is sent Harbinger, who <mark4>all</mark4><br>
Invites, and in the Consecrated <mark4>stream</mark4><br>
Pretends to wash off sin, and fit them <mark3>so</mark3><br>
Purified to receive him pure, or <mark4>rather</mark4><br>
To do him honour as their King; all <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
And he himself among them was <mark1>baptiz'd,</mark1><br>
Not thence to be more pure, but to <mark3>receive</mark3><br>
The testimony of Heaven, that who he <mark4>is</mark4><br>
Thenceforth the Nations may not doubt; I saw <br>
The Prophet do him reverence, on him <mark4>rising</mark4><br>
Out of the water, Heav'n above the <mark4>Clouds</mark4><br>
Unfold her Crystal Dores, thence on his <mark1>head</mark1><br>
A perfect Dove descend, what e're it <mark4>meant,</mark4><br>
And out of Heav'n the Sov'raign voice I <mark4>heard,</mark4><br>
This is my Son <mark4>belov'd</mark4>, in him am <mark4>pleas'd.</mark4><br>
His Mother then is mortal, but his <mark4>Sire,</mark4><br>
He who obtains the Monarchy of <mark1>Heav'n,</mark1><br>
And what will he not do to advance his <mark1>Son?</mark1><br>
His first-begot we know, and sore have <mark4>felt,</mark4><br>
When his fierce thunder drove us to the <mark5>deep;</mark5><br>
Who this is we must learn, for man he <mark4>seems</mark4><br>
In all his lineaments, though in his <mark4>face</mark4><br>
The glimpses of his Fathers glory <mark4>shine.</mark4><br>
Ye see our danger on the utmost <mark4>edge</mark4><br>
Of hazard, which admits no long <mark4>debate,</mark4><br>
But must with something sudden be oppos'd, <br>
Not force, but well couch't fraud, well woven <mark4>snares,</mark4><br>
E're in the head of Nations he <mark3>appear</mark3><br>
Their King, their Leader, and Supream on <mark1>Earth.</mark1><br>
I, when no other durst, sole <mark4>undertook</mark4><br>
The dismal expedition to find <mark4>out</mark4><br>
And ruine Adam, and the exploit <mark4>perform'd</mark4><br>
Successfully; a calmer voyage <mark1>now</mark1><br>
Will waft me; and the way found prosperous <mark4>once</mark4><br>
Induces best to hope of like <mark4>success.</mark4><br>
He ended, and his words impression <mark4>left</mark4><br>
Of much amazement to th' infernal <mark3>Crew,</mark3><br>
Distracted and surpriz'd with deep <mark5>dismay</mark5><br>
At these sad tidings; but no time was <mark4>then</mark4><br>
For long indulgence to their fears or <mark4>grief:</mark4><br>
Unanimous they all commit the <mark4>care</mark4><br>
And management of this main enterprize <br>
To him their great Dictator, whose <mark4>attempt</mark4><br>
At first against mankind so well had <mark5>thriv'd</mark5><br>
In Adam's overthrow, and led thir march <br>
From Hell's deep-vaulted Den to dwell in <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
Regents and Potentates, and <mark4>Kings</mark4>, yea <mark4>gods</mark4><br>
Of many a pleasant Realm and Province <mark4>wide.</mark4><br>
So to the Coast of Jordan he <mark4>directs</mark4><br>
His easie steps; girded with snaky <mark4>wiles,</mark4><br>
Where he might likeliest find this new-declar'd, <br>
This man of men, attested Son of <mark4>God,</mark4><br>
Temptation and all guile on him to <mark3>try;</mark3><br>
So to subvert whom he suspected <mark4>rais'd</mark4><br>
To end his Raign on Earth so long <mark4>enjoy'd:</mark4><br>
But contrary unweeting he <mark4>fulfill'd</mark4><br>
The purpos'd Counsel pre-ordain'd and fixt <br>
Of the most High, who in full frequence <mark3>bright</mark3><br>
Of Angels, thus to Gabriel smiling <mark4>spake.</mark4><br>
Gabriel this day by proof thou shalt <mark4>behold,</mark4><br>
Thou and all Angels conversant on <mark1>Earth</mark1><br>
With man or mens affairs, how I <mark4>begin</mark4><br>
To verifie that solemn message <mark4>late,</mark4><br>
On which I sent thee to the Virgin <mark4>pure</mark4><br>
In Galilee, that she should bear a <mark1>Son</mark1><br>
Great in Renown, and call'd the Son of <mark1>God;</mark1><br>
Then toldst her doubting how these things could <mark3>be</mark3><br>
To her a Virgin, that on her should <mark1>come</mark1><br>
The Holy <mark4>Ghost</mark4>, and the power of the <mark4>highest</mark4><br>
O're-shadow her: this man born and now <mark4>up-grown,</mark4><br>
To shew him worthy of his birth <mark1>divine</mark1><br>
And high prediction, henceforth I <mark4>expose</mark4><br>
To Satan; let him tempt and now <mark4>assay</mark4><br>
His utmost subtilty, because he <mark4>boasts</mark4><br>
And vaunts of his great cunning to the <mark4>throng</mark4><br>
Of his Apostasie; he might have <mark4>learnt</mark4><br>
Less over-weening, since he fail'd in <mark1>Job,</mark1><br>
Whose constant perseverance <mark4>overcame</mark4><br>
Whate're his cruel malice could <mark4>invent.</mark4><br>
He now shall know I can produce a <mark4>man</mark4><br>
Of female Seed, far abler to <mark4>resist</mark4><br>
All his sollicitations, and at <mark4>length</mark4><br>
All his vast force, and drive him back to <mark1>Hell,</mark1><br>
Winning by Conquest what the first man <mark4>lost</mark4><br>
By fallacy surpriz'd.   But first I <mark4>mean</mark4><br>
To exercise him in the <mark1>Wilderness,</mark1><br>
There he shall first lay down the <mark4>rudiments</mark4><br>
Of his great warfare, e're I send him <mark4>forth</mark4><br>
To conquer Sin and Death the two grand <mark3>foes,</mark3><br>
By Humiliation and strong Sufferance: <br>
His weakness shall o'recome Satanic <mark4>strength</mark4><br>
And all the world, and mass of sinful flesh; <br>
That all the Angels and AEtherial <mark4>Powers,</mark4><br>
They now, and men hereafter may <mark4>discern,</mark4><br>
From what consummate vertue I have <mark4>chose</mark4><br>
This perfect <mark4>Man</mark4>, by merit call'd my <mark1>Son,</mark1><br>
To earn Salvation for the Sons of <mark1>men.</mark1><br>
So spake the Eternal Father, and all <mark4>Heaven</mark4><br>
Admiring stood a space, then into <mark4>Hymns</mark4><br>
Burst forth, and in Celestial measures mov'd, <br>
Circling the Throne and Singing, while the <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
Sung with the voice, and this the <mark4>argument.</mark4><br>
Victory and Triumph to the Son of <mark1>God</mark1><br>
Now entring his great duel, not of <mark4>arms,</mark4><br>
But to vanquish by wisdom hellish <mark1>wiles.</mark1><br>
The Father knows the Son; therefore <mark3>secure</mark3><br>
Ventures his filial Vertue, though <mark5>untri'd,</mark5><br>
Against whate're may tempt, whate're <mark4>seduce,</mark4><br>
Allure, or terrifie, or <mark4>undermine.</mark4><br>
Be frustrate all ye stratagems of <mark1>Hell,</mark1><br>
And devilish machinations come to nought. <br>
   So they in Heav'n their Odes and Vigils tun'd: <br>
Mean while the Son of God, who yet some <mark4>days</mark4><br>
Lodg'd in Bethabara where John <mark1>baptiz'd,</mark1><br>
Musing and much revolving in his <mark4>brest,</mark4><br>
How best the mighty work he might <mark1>begin</mark1><br>
Of Saviour to mankind, and which way <mark4>first</mark4><br>
Publish his God-like office now <mark3>mature,</mark3><br>
One day forth walk'd alone, the Spirit <mark4>leading;</mark4><br>
And his deep <mark4>thoughts</mark4>, the better to <mark4>converse</mark4><br>
With solitude, till far from track of <mark1>men,</mark1><br>
Thought following thought, and step by step led <mark4>on,</mark4><br>
He entred now the bordering Desert <mark4>wild,</mark4><br>
And with dark shades and rocks environ'd <mark4>round,</mark4><br>
His holy Meditations thus <mark5>persu'd.</mark5><br>
O what a multitude of thoughts at <mark1>once</mark1><br>
Awakn'd in me swarm, while I <mark4>consider</mark4><br>
What from within I feel my self, and <mark4>hear</mark4><br>
What from without comes often to my <mark4>ears,</mark4><br>
Ill sorting with my present state <mark5>compar'd.</mark5><br>
When I was yet a child, no childish <mark3>play</mark3><br>
To me was pleasing, all my mind was <mark4>set</mark4><br>
Serious to learn and know, and thence to <mark3>do</mark3><br>
What might be publick good; my self I <mark4>thought</mark4><br>
Born to that end, born to promote all <mark4>truth,</mark4><br>
All righteous things: therefore above my <mark3>years,</mark3><br>
The Law of God I read, and found it <mark4>sweet,</mark4><br>
Made it my whole delight, and in it <mark3>grew</mark3><br>
To such perfection, that e're yet my <mark1>age</mark1><br>
Had measur'd twice six years, at our great <mark4>Feast</mark4><br>
I went into the Temple, there to <mark1>hear</mark1><br>
The Teachers of our Law, and to <mark4>propose</mark4><br>
What might improve my knowledge or their <mark4>own;</mark4><br>
And was admir'd by <mark1>all</mark1>, yet this not <mark1>all</mark1><br>
To which my Spirit aspir'd, victorious <mark1>deeds</mark1><br>
Flam'd in my heart, heroic acts, one <mark4>while</mark4><br>
To rescue Israel from the Roman <mark4>yoke,</mark4><br>
Then to subdue and quell o're all the <mark1>earth</mark1><br>
Brute violence and proud Tyrannick <mark4>pow'r,</mark4><br>
Till truth were freed, and equity <mark5>restor'd:</mark5><br>
Yet held it more humane, more heavenly <mark1>first</mark1><br>
By winning words to conquer willing <mark4>hearts,</mark4><br>
And make perswasion do the work of <mark1>fear;</mark1><br>
At least to try, and teach the erring <mark4>Soul</mark4><br>
Not wilfully mis-doing, but unware <br>
Misled; the stubborn only to <mark3>destroy.</mark3><br>
These growing thoughts my Mother soon <mark4>perceiving</mark4><br>
By words at times cast forth inly rejoyc'd, <br>
And said to me apart, high are thy <mark4>thoughts</mark4><br>
O Son, but nourish them and let them <mark4>soar</mark4><br>
To what highth sacred vertue and true <mark3>worth</mark3><br>
Can raise them, though above example <mark3>high;</mark3><br>
By matchless Deeds express thy matchless <mark1>Sire.</mark1><br>
For know, thou art no Son of mortal <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
Though men esteem thee low of <mark4>Parentage,</mark4><br>
Thy Father is the Eternal King, who <mark4>rules</mark4><br>
All Heaven and Earth, Angels and Sons of <mark1>men,</mark1><br>
A messenger from God fore-told thy <mark3>birth</mark3><br>
Conceiv'd in me a Virgin, he <mark4>fore-told</mark4><br>
Thou shouldst be great and sit on David's <mark4>Throne,</mark4><br>
And of thy Kingdom there should be no <mark4>end.</mark4><br>
At thy Nativity a glorious <mark4>Quire</mark4><br>
Of Angels in the fields of Bethlehem <mark1>sung</mark1><br>
To Shepherds watching at their folds by <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
And told them the Messiah now was <mark1>born,</mark1><br>
Where they might see <mark4>him</mark4>, and to thee they <mark1>came;</mark1><br>
Directed to the Manger where thou <mark4>lais't,</mark4><br>
For in the Inn was left no better <mark4>room:</mark4><br>
A Star, not seen before in Heaven <mark4>appearing</mark4><br>
Guided the Wise Men thither from the <mark4>East,</mark4><br>
To honour thee with Incense, Myrrh, and <mark4>Gold,</mark4><br>
By whose bright course led on they found the <mark4>place,</mark4><br>
Affirming it thy Star new grav'n in <mark1>Heaven,</mark1><br>
By which they knew thee King of Israel <mark1>born.</mark1><br>
Just Simeon and Prophetic Anna, <mark4>warn'd</mark4><br>
By Vision, found thee in the Temple, and <mark1>spake</mark1><br>
Before the Altar and the vested <mark3>Priest,</mark3><br>
Like things of thee to all that present <mark4>stood.</mark4><br>
This having heard, strait I again <mark5>revolv'd</mark5><br>
The Law and Prophets, searching what was <mark4>writ</mark4><br>
Concerning the Messiah, to our <mark4>Scribes</mark4><br>
Known partly, and soon found of whom they <mark1>spake</mark1><br>
I am; this chiefly, that my way must <mark3>lie</mark3><br>
Through many a hard assay even to the <mark4>death,</mark4><br>
E're I the promis'd Kingdom can <mark4>attain,</mark4><br>
Or work Redemption for mankind, whose <mark4>sins</mark4><br>
Full weight must be transferr'd upon my <mark1>head.</mark1><br>
Yet neither thus disheartn'd or <mark4>dismay'd,</mark4><br>
The time prefixt I <mark4>waited</mark4>, when <mark1>behold</mark1><br>
The Baptist, (of whose birth I oft had <mark1>heard,</mark1><br>
Not knew by sight) now <mark1>come</mark1>, who was to <mark1>come</mark1><br>
Before Messiah and his way <mark4>prepare.</mark4><br>
I as all others to his Baptism <mark1>came,</mark1><br>
Which I believ'd was from above; but <mark3>he</mark3><br>
Strait knew me, and with loudest voice <mark4>proclaim'd</mark4><br>
Me him (for it was shew'n him so from <mark1>Heaven)</mark1><br>
Me him whose Harbinger he was; and <mark1>first</mark1><br>
Refus'd on me his Baptism to <mark5>confer,</mark5><br>
As much his greater, and was hardly <mark4>won;</mark4><br>
But as I rose out of the laving <mark1>stream,</mark1><br>
Heaven open'd her eternal doors, from <mark4>whence</mark4><br>
The Spirit descended on me like a <mark1>Dove,</mark1><br>
And last the sum of all, my Father's <mark1>voice,</mark1><br>
Audibly heard from Heav'n, pronounc'd me <mark4>his,</mark4><br>
Me his beloved <mark4>Son</mark4>, in whom <mark4>alone</mark4><br>
He was well pleas'd; by which I knew the <mark4>time</mark4><br>
Now full, that I no more should live <mark1>obscure,</mark1><br>
But openly begin, as best <mark4>becomes</mark4><br>
The Authority which I deriv'd from <mark1>Heaven.</mark1><br>
And now by some strong motion I am <mark4>led</mark4><br>
Into this Wilderness, to what <mark4>intent</mark4><br>
I learn not yet, perhaps I need not <mark1>know;</mark1><br>
For what concerns my knowledge God <mark4>reveals.</mark4><br>
So spake our Morning Star then in his <mark4>rise,</mark4><br>
And looking round on every side <mark4>beheld</mark4><br>
A pathless Desert, dusk with horrid <mark4>shades;</mark4><br>
The way he came not having mark'd, <mark4>return</mark4><br>
Was difficult, by humane steps <mark5>untrod;</mark5><br>
And he still on was led, but with such <mark1>thoughts</mark1><br>
Accompanied of things past and to <mark1>come</mark1><br>
Lodg'd in his breast, as well might <mark4>recommend</mark4><br>
Such Solitude before choicest <mark4>Society.</mark4><br>
Full forty days he pass'd, whether on <mark4>hill</mark4><br>
Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each <mark1>night</mark1><br>
Under the covert of some ancient <mark4>Oak,</mark4><br>
Or Cedar, to defend him from the <mark3>dew,</mark3><br>
Or harbour'd in one Cave, is not <mark4>reveal'd;</mark4><br>
Nor tasted humane food, nor hunger <mark1>felt</mark1><br>
Till those days ended, hunger'd then at <mark4>last</mark4><br>
Among wild Beasts: they at his sight grew <mark4>mild,</mark4><br>
Nor sleeping him nor waking harm'd, his <mark4>walk</mark4><br>
The fiery Serpent fled, and noxious <mark4>Worm,</mark4><br>
The Lion and fierce Tiger glar'd <mark4>aloof.</mark4><br>
But now an aged man in Rural <mark4>weeds,</mark4><br>
Following, as seem'd, the quest of some stray <mark3>Ewe,</mark3><br>
Or wither'd sticks to gather; which might <mark4>serve</mark4><br>
Against a Winters day when winds blow <mark4>keen,</mark4><br>
To warm him wet return'd from field at <mark1>Eve,</mark1><br>
He saw approach, who first with curious <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
Perus'd him, then with words thus utt'red <mark1>spake.</mark1><br>
Sir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this <mark1>place</mark1><br>
So far from path or road of men, who <mark4>pass</mark4><br>
In Troop or <mark4>Caravan</mark4>, for single <mark4>none</mark4><br>
Durst ever, who return'd, and dropt not <mark4>here</mark4><br>
His Carcass, pin'd with hunger and with droughth? <br>
I ask the rather, and the more <mark4>admire,</mark4><br>
For that to me thou seem'st the man, whom <mark1>late</mark1><br>
Our new baptizing Prophet at the <mark4>Ford</mark4><br>
Of Jordan honour'd so, and call'd thee <mark1>Son</mark1><br>
Of God; I saw and heard, for we <mark4>sometimes</mark4><br>
Who dwell this wild, constrain'd by want, come <mark1>forth</mark1><br>
To Town or Village nigh (nighest is <mark4>far)</mark4><br>
Where ought we <mark1>hear</mark1>, and curious are to <mark1>hear,</mark1><br>
What happ'ns new; Fame also finds us <mark1>out.</mark1><br>
To whom the Son of God. Who brought me <mark4>hither</mark4><br>
Will bring me hence, no other Guide I <mark4>seek.</mark4><br>
By Miracle he may, reply'd the <mark4>Swain,</mark4><br>
What other way I see not, for we <mark1>here</mark1><br>
Live on tough roots and stubs, to thirst inur'd <br>
More then the Camel, and to drink go <mark1>far,</mark1><br>
Men to much misery and hardship <mark1>born;</mark1><br>
But if thou be the Son of <mark4>God</mark4>, <mark4>Command</mark4><br>
That out of these hard stones be made thee <mark4>bread;</mark4><br>
So shalt thou save thy self and us <mark3>relieve</mark3><br>
With Food, whereof we wretched seldom <mark4>taste.</mark4><br>
He ended, and the Son of God <mark4>reply'd.</mark4><br>
Think'st thou such force in Bread? is it not <mark4>written</mark4><br>
(For I discern thee other then thou <mark4>seem'st)</mark4><br>
Man lives not by Bread only, but each <mark4>Word</mark4><br>
Proceeding from the mouth of <mark4>God</mark4>, who <mark4>fed</mark4><br>
Our Fathers here with Manna; in the <mark4>Mount</mark4><br>
Moses was forty days, nor eat nor <mark4>drank,</mark4><br>
And forty days Eliah without <mark4>food</mark4><br>
Wandred this barren waste, the same I <mark1>now.</mark1><br>
Why dost thou then suggest to me <mark4>distrust,</mark4><br>
Knowing who I am, as I know who thou <mark4>art?</mark4><br>
Whom thus answer'd th' Arch Fiend now <mark5>undisguis'd.</mark5><br>
'Tis true, I am that Spirit <mark4>unfortunate,</mark4><br>
Who leagu'd with millions more in rash <mark4>revolt</mark4><br>
Kept not my happy Station, but was driv'n <br>
With them from bliss to the bottomless <mark1>deep,</mark1><br>
Yet to that hideous place not so <mark5>confin'd</mark5><br>
By rigour unconniving, but that <mark4>oft</mark4><br>
Leaving my dolorous Prison I <mark3>enjoy</mark3><br>
Large liberty to round this Globe of <mark1>Earth,</mark1><br>
Or range in th' Air, nor from the Heav'n of <mark5>Heav'ns</mark5><br>
Hath he excluded my resort <mark1>sometimes.</mark1><br>
I came among the Sons of God, when <mark1>he</mark1><br>
Gave up into my hands Uzzean <mark1>Job</mark1><br>
To prove him, and illustrate his high <mark1>worth;</mark1><br>
And when to all his Angels he <mark5>propos'd</mark5><br>
To draw the proud King Ahab into <mark4>fraud</mark4><br>
That he might fall in Ramoth, they demuring, <br>
I undertook that office, and the <mark4>tongues</mark4><br>
Of all his flattering Prophets glibb'd with <mark1>lyes</mark1><br>
To his destruction, as I had in <mark4>charge.</mark4><br>
For what he bids I do; though I have <mark1>lost</mark1><br>
Much lustre of my native brightness, <mark1>lost</mark1><br>
To be belov'd of God, I have not <mark1>lost</mark1><br>
To love, at least contemplate and <mark1>admire</mark1><br>
What I see excellent in good, or <mark4>fair,</mark4><br>
Or vertuous, I should so have lost all <mark4>sense.</mark4><br>
What can be then less in me then <mark4>desire</mark4><br>
To see thee and approach thee, whom I <mark1>know</mark1><br>
Declar'd the Son of God, to hear <mark5>attent</mark5><br>
Thy wisdom, and behold thy God-like <mark1>deeds?</mark1><br>
Men generally think me much a <mark3>foe</mark3><br>
To all mankind: why should I? they to <mark3>me</mark3><br>
Never did wrong or violence, by <mark4>them</mark4><br>
I lost not what I lost, rather by <mark1>them</mark1><br>
I gain'd what I have gain'd, and with them <mark4>dwell</mark4><br>
Copartner in these Regions of the <mark1>World,</mark1><br>
If not disposer; lend them oft my <mark4>aid,</mark4><br>
Oft my advice by presages and <mark4>signs,</mark4><br>
And answers, <mark4>oracles</mark4>, portents and <mark4>dreams,</mark4><br>
Whereby they may direct their future <mark4>life.</mark4><br>
Envy they say excites me, thus to <mark4>gain</mark4><br>
Companions of my misery and <mark3>wo.</mark3><br>
At first it may be; but long since with <mark1>wo</mark1><br>
Nearer acquainted, now I feel by <mark4>proof,</mark4><br>
That fellowship in pain divides not <mark4>smart,</mark4><br>
Nor lightens aught each mans peculiar <mark4>load.</mark4><br>
Small consolation then, were Man adjoyn'd: <br>
This wounds me most (what can it less) that <mark1>Man,</mark1><br>
Man fall'n shall be restor'd, I never <mark4>more.</mark4><br>
To whom our Saviour sternly thus <mark1>reply'd.</mark1><br>
Deservedly thou griev'st, compos'd of <mark1>lyes</mark1><br>
From the beginning, and in lies wilt <mark1>end;</mark1><br>
Who boast'st release from Hell, and leave to <mark1>come</mark1><br>
Into the Heav'n of Heavens; thou com'st <mark4>indeed,</mark4><br>
As a poor miserable captive <mark4>thrall,</mark4><br>
Comes to the place where he before had <mark4>sat</mark4><br>
Among the Prime in Splendour, now depos'd, <br>
Ejected, emptyed, gaz'd, unpityed, <mark4>shun'd,</mark4><br>
A spectacle of ruin or of <mark4>scorn</mark4><br>
To all the Host of Heaven; the happy <mark1>place</mark1><br>
Imparts to thee no happiness, no <mark3>joy,</mark3><br>
Rather inflames thy torment, <mark4>representing</mark4><br>
Lost bliss, to thee no more <mark4>communicable,</mark4><br>
So never more in Hell then when in <mark1>Heaven.</mark1><br>
But thou art serviceable to Heaven's <mark4>King.</mark4><br>
Wilt thou impute to obedience what thy <mark1>fear</mark1><br>
<mark4>Extorts</mark4>, or pleasure to do ill <mark4>excites?</mark4><br>
What but thy malice mov'd thee to <mark5>misdeem</mark5><br>
Of righteous Job, then cruelly to afflict <mark4>him</mark4><br>
With all inflictions, but his patience <mark1>won?</mark1><br>
The other service was thy chosen <mark4>task,</mark4><br>
To be a lyer in four hundred <mark4>mouths;</mark4><br>
For lying is thy sustenance, thy <mark1>food.</mark1><br>
Yet thou pretend'st to truth; all <mark4>Oracles</mark4><br>
By thee are giv'n, and what confest more <mark3>true</mark3><br>
Among the Nations? that hath been thy <mark4>craft,</mark4><br>
By mixing somewhat true to vent more <mark1>lyes.</mark1><br>
But what have been thy answers, what but <mark4>dark</mark4><br>
Ambiguous and with double sense <mark4>deluding,</mark4><br>
Which they who ask'd have seldom <mark4>understood,</mark4><br>
And not well understood as good not <mark4>known?</mark4><br>
Who ever by consulting at thy <mark4>shrine</mark4><br>
Return'd the wiser, or the more <mark4>instruct</mark4><br>
To flye or follow what concern'd him <mark4>most,</mark4><br>
And run not sooner to his fatal <mark4>snare?</mark4><br>
For God hath justly giv'n the Nations <mark4>up</mark4><br>
To thy Delusions; justly, since they <mark4>fell</mark4><br>
Idolatrous, but when his purpose <mark1>is</mark1><br>
Among them to declare his <mark4>Providence</mark4><br>
To thee not known, whence hast thou then thy <mark1>truth,</mark1><br>
But from him or his Angels <mark4>President</mark4><br>
In every Province, who themselves <mark4>disdaining</mark4><br>
To approach thy Temples, give thee in <mark1>command</mark1><br>
What to the smallest tittle thou shalt <mark3>say</mark3><br>
To thy Adorers; thou with trembling <mark1>fear,</mark1><br>
Or like a Fawning Parasite <mark4>obey'st;</mark4><br>
Then to thy self ascrib'st the truth <mark1>fore-told.</mark1><br>
But this thy glory shall be soon <mark4>retrench'd;</mark4><br>
No more shalt thou by oracling <mark4>abuse</mark4><br>
The Gentiles; henceforth Oracles are ceast, <br>
And thou no more with Pomp and <mark4>Sacrifice</mark4><br>
Shalt be enquir'd at Delphos or <mark4>elsewhere,</mark4><br>
At least in vain, for they shall find thee <mark1>mute.</mark1><br>
God hath now sent his living <mark4>Oracle</mark4><br>
Into the World, to teach his final <mark4>will,</mark4><br>
And sends his Spirit of Truth henceforth to <mark1>dwell</mark1><br>
In pious Hearts, an inward <mark1>Oracle</mark1><br>
To all truth requisite for men to <mark1>know.</mark1><br>
So spake our Saviour; but the subtle <mark4>Fiend,</mark4><br>
Though inly stung with anger and <mark4>disdain,</mark4><br>
Dissembl'd, and this Answer smooth <mark4>return'd.</mark4><br>
Sharply thou hast insisted on <mark4>rebuke,</mark4><br>
And urg'd me hard with doings, which not <mark1>will</mark1><br>
But misery hath rested from me; <mark4>where</mark4><br>
Easily canst thou find one <mark4>miserable,</mark4><br>
And not inforc'd oft-times to part from <mark1>truth;</mark1><br>
If it may stand him more in stead to <mark3>lye,</mark3><br>
Say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure? <br>
But thou art plac't above me, thou art <mark4>Lord;</mark4><br>
From thee I can and must submiss <mark4>endure</mark4><br>
Check or reproof, and glad to scape so <mark4>quit.</mark4><br>
Hard are the ways of truth, and rough to <mark1>walk,</mark1><br>
Smooth on the tongue discourst, pleasing to th' <mark4>ear,</mark4><br>
And tuneable as Silvan Pipe or <mark4>Song;</mark4><br>
What wonder then if I delight to <mark1>hear</mark1><br>
Her dictates from thy mouth? most men <mark1>admire</mark1><br>
Vertue, who follow not her lore: permit <mark1>me</mark1><br>
To hear thee when I come (since no man <mark4>comes)</mark4><br>
And talk at least, though I despair to <mark1>attain.</mark1><br>
Thy Father, who is holy, wise and <mark1>pure,</mark1><br>
Suffers the Hypocrite or Atheous <mark1>Priest</mark1><br>
To tread his Sacred Courts, and <mark4>minister</mark4><br>
About his Altar, handling holy <mark4>things,</mark4><br>
Praying or vowing, and vouchsaf'd his <mark1>voice</mark1><br>
To Balaam <mark4>Reprobate</mark4>, a Prophet <mark4>yet</mark4><br>
Inspir'd; disdain not such access to <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
To whom our Saviour with unalter'd <mark3>brow.</mark3><br>
Thy coming hither, though I know thy <mark4>scope,</mark4><br>
I bid not or forbid; do as thou <mark4>find'st</mark4><br>
Permission from above; thou canst not <mark1>more.</mark1><br>
He added not; and Satan bowing <mark3>low</mark3><br>
His gray dissimulation, <mark4>disappear'd</mark4><br>
Into thin Air diffus'd: for now <mark4>began</mark4><br>
Night with her sullen wing to <mark4>double-shade</mark4><br>
The Desert, Fowls in thir clay nests were <mark4>couch't;</mark4><br>
And now wild Beasts came forth the woods to <mark4>roam.</mark4><br>
