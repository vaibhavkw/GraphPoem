Title : A Shropshire Lad 2: Loveliest of trees, the cherry now <br>
Author : A. E. Housman <br><br>

Loveliest of trees, the cherry <mark3>now</mark3><br>
Is hung with bloom along the <mark3>bough,</mark3><br>
And stands about the woodland ride <br>
Wearing white for Eastertide. <br>
<br>
Now, of my threescore years and <mark3>ten,</mark3><br>
Twenty will not come <mark3>again,</mark3><br>
And take from seventy springs a <mark3>score,</mark3><br>
It only leaves me fifty <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
<br>
And since to look at things in <mark3>bloom</mark3><br>
Fifty springs are little <mark3>room,</mark3><br>
About the woodlands I will <mark3>go</mark3><br>
To see the cherry hung with <mark3>snow.</mark3><br>
