Title : from The Task, Book II: The Time-Piece <br>
Author : William Cowper <br><br>

<br>
England, with all thy faults, I love thee <mark4>still</mark4><br>
My country! and while yet a nook is <mark4>left</mark4><br>
Where English minds and manners may be <mark5>found,</mark5><br>
Shall be constrain'd to love thee.  Though thy clime <br>
Be fickle, and thy year, most part, <mark4>deform'd</mark4><br>
With dripping rains, or wither'd by a <mark4>frost,</mark4><br>
I would not yet exchange thy sullen <mark4>skies</mark4><br>
And fields without a flow'r, for warmer <mark4>France</mark4><br>
With all her <mark4>vines</mark4>, nor for Ausonia's <mark4>groves</mark4><br>
Of golden fruitage and her myrtle <mark4>bow'rs.</mark4><br>
To shake thy senate, and from heights <mark4>sublime</mark4><br>
Of patriot eloquence to flash down <mark3>fire</mark3><br>
Upon thy foes, was never meant my <mark4>task:</mark4><br>
But I can feel thy fortunes, and <mark4>partake</mark4><br>
Thy joys and sorrows with as true a <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
As any thund'rer there.  And I can <mark4>feel</mark4><br>
Thy follies too, and with a just <mark4>disdain</mark4><br>
Frown at effeminates, whose very <mark4>looks</mark4><br>
Reflect dishonour on the land I <mark5>love.</mark5><br>
How, in the name of soldiership and <mark4>sense,</mark4><br>
Should England prosper, when such things, as smooth <br>
And tender as a girl, all essenc'd <mark3>o'er</mark3><br>
With odors, and as profligate as <mark4>sweet,</mark4><br>
Who sell their laurel for a myrtle wreath, <br>
And love when they should fight; when such as <mark4>these</mark4><br>
Presume to lay their hand upon the <mark4>ark</mark4><br>
Of her magnificent and awful <mark4>cause?</mark4><br>
Time was when it was praise and boast <mark1>enough</mark1><br>
In ev'ry clime, and travel where we <mark4>might,</mark4><br>
That we were born her children.  Praise <mark1>enough</mark1><br>
To fill th' ambition of a private <mark4>man,</mark4><br>
That Chatham's language was his mother <mark4>tongue,</mark4><br>
And Wolfe's great name compatriot with his <mark4>own.</mark4><br>
Farewell those honors, and farewell with <mark4>them</mark4><br>
The hope of such hereafter!  They have <mark4>fall'n</mark4><br>
Each in his field of glory: one in <mark4>arms,</mark4><br>
And one in council.  Wolfe upon the lap <br>
Of smiling victory that moment <mark4>won,</mark4><br>
And <mark4>Chatham</mark4>, heart-sick of his country's <mark4>shame.</mark4><br>
They made us many soldiers.  Chatham <mark1>still</mark1><br>
Consulting England's happiness at <mark4>home,</mark4><br>
Secur'd it by an unforgiving <mark4>frown</mark4><br>
If any wrong'd her.  Wolfe, where'er he <mark4>fought,</mark4><br>
Put so much of his heart into his <mark4>act,</mark4><br>
That his example had a magnet's <mark4>force,</mark4><br>
And all were swift to follow whom all <mark4>loved.</mark4><br>
Those suns are set.  Oh rise some other <mark1>such!</mark1><br>
Or all that we have left is empty <mark4>talk</mark4><br>
Of old achievements, and despair of new. <br>
<br>
. . .<br>
<br>
There is a pleasure in poetic <mark4>pains</mark4><br>
Which only poets know.  The shifts and <mark4>turns,</mark4><br>
Th' expedients and inventions multiform <br>
To which the mind resorts, in chase of <mark4>terms</mark4><br>
Thought apt, yet coy, and difficult to <mark4>win--</mark4><br>
T' arrest the fleeting images that <mark3>fill</mark3><br>
The mirror of the mind, and hold them <mark4>fast,</mark4><br>
And force them sit, 'till he has pencill'd <mark4>off</mark4><br>
A faithful likeness of the forms he <mark4>views;</mark4><br>
Then to dispose his copies with such <mark4>art</mark4><br>
That each may find its most propitious <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
And shine by situation, hardly <mark4>less,</mark4><br>
Than by the labor and the skill it <mark4>cost,</mark4><br>
Are occupations of the poet's <mark4>mind</mark4><br>
So pleasing, and that steal away the <mark4>thought</mark4><br>
With such address from themes of sad <mark4>import,</mark4><br>
That lost in his own musings, happy <mark1>man!</mark1><br>
He feels th' anxieties of life, <mark4>denied</mark4><br>
Their wonted entertainment, all <mark3>retire.</mark3><br>
Such joys has he that sings.  But ah! not <mark1>such,</mark1><br>
Or seldom such, the hearers of his <mark4>song.</mark4><br>
Fastidious, or else <mark4>listless</mark4>, or <mark4>perhaps</mark4><br>
Aware of nothing arduous in a <mark1>task</mark1><br>
They never undertook, they little <mark4>note</mark4><br>
His dangers or escapes, and haply <mark4>find</mark4><br>
There least amusement where he found the <mark4>most.</mark4><br>
But is amusement all?  studious of <mark1>song,</mark1><br>
And yet ambitious not to sing in <mark4>vain,</mark4><br>
I would not trifle merely, though the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
Be loudest in their praise who do no <mark4>more.</mark4><br>
Yet what can satire, whether grave or gay? <br>
It may correct a foible, may <mark4>chastise</mark4><br>
The freaks of fashion, regulate the <mark4>dress,</mark4><br>
Retrench a sword-blade, or displace a <mark4>patch;</mark4><br>
But where are its sublimer trophies <mark1>found?</mark1><br>
What vice has it subdu'd? whose heart <mark4>reclaim'd</mark4><br>
By rigour, or whom laugh'd into <mark4>reform?</mark4><br>
Alas! Leviathan is not so <mark4>tam'd:</mark4><br>
Laugh'd at, he laughs again; <mark4>and</mark4>, stricken <mark4>hard,</mark4><br>
Turns to the stroke his adamantine <mark4>scales,</mark4><br>
That fear no discipline of human <mark4>hands.</mark4><br>
<br>
The pulpit, therefore (and I name it, <mark4>fill'd</mark4><br>
With solemn awe, that bids me well <mark4>beware</mark4><br>
With what intent I touch that holy <mark4>thing)</mark4><br>
The pulpit (when the sat'rist has at <mark4>last,</mark4><br>
Strutting and vap'ring in an empty <mark4>school,</mark4><br>
Spent all his force and made no proselyte) <br>
I say the pulpit (in the sober <mark4>use</mark4><br>
Of its legitimate, peculiar <mark4>pow'rs)</mark4><br>
Must stand acknowledg'd, while the world shall <mark4>stand,</mark4><br>
The most important and effectual <mark4>guard,</mark4><br>
Support and ornament of virtue's <mark1>cause.</mark1><br>
