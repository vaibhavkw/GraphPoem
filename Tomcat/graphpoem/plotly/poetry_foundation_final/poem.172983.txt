Title : The Lady's Yes <br>
Author : Elizabeth Barrett Browning <br><br>

" Yes !" I answered you last night <mark4>;</mark4><br>
" No !" this morning, Sir, I say <mark3>!</mark3><br>
Colours, seen by <mark4>candle-light,</mark4><br>
Will not look the same by <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
<br>
When the tabors played their <mark4>best,</mark4><br>
Lamps above, and laughs below <mark3>?</mark3><br>
Love me sounded like a <mark3>jest,</mark3><br>
Fit for Yes or fit for No <mark3>!</mark3><br>
<br>
Call me false, or call me free <mark3>?</mark3><br>
Vow, whatever light may <mark3>shine,</mark3><br>
No man on your face shall <mark3>see</mark3><br>
Any grief for change on <mark3>mine.</mark3><br>
<br>
Yet the sin is on us both <mark3>?</mark3><br>
Time to dance is not to woo <mark3>?</mark3><br>
Wooer light makes fickle troth <mark3>?</mark3><br>
Scorn of me recoils on you <mark3>!</mark3><br>
<br>
Learn to win a lady's <mark4>faith</mark4><br>
    Nobly, as the thing is high ;<br>
Bravely, as for life and death <mark4>?</mark4><br>
    With a loyal gravity.<br>
<br>
Lead her from the festive <mark4>boards,</mark4><br>
Point her to the starry <mark4>skies,</mark4><br>
Guard her, by your truthful <mark4>words,</mark4><br>
    Pure from courtship's flatteries.<br>
<br>
By your truth she shall be true <mark3>?</mark3><br>
Ever true, as wives of yore <mark4>?</mark4><br>
And her Yes, once said to <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
SHALL be Yes for <mark4>evermore.</mark4><br>
