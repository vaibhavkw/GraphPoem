Author : William Wordsworth <br><br>

--Was it for <mark4>this</mark4><br>
That one, the fairest of all Rivers, <mark1>lov'd</mark1><br>
To blend his murmurs with my Nurse's <mark4>song,</mark4><br>
And from his alder shades and rocky <mark4>falls,</mark4><br>
And from his fords and shallows, sent a <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
That flow'd along my dreams? For this, didst Thou, <br>
O Derwent! travelling over the green <mark4>Plains</mark4><br>
Near my 'sweet Birthplace', didst thou, beauteous <mark4>Stream</mark4><br>
Make ceaseless music through the night and <mark1>day</mark1><br>
Which with its steady cadence, <mark4>tempering</mark4><br>
Our human waywardness, compos'd my <mark4>thoughts</mark4><br>
To more than infant softness, giving <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Among the fretful dwellings of <mark4>mankind,</mark4><br>
A knowledge, a dim earnest, of the <mark4>calm</mark4><br>
That Nature breathes among the hills and <mark4>groves.</mark4><br>
When, having left his <mark4>Mountains</mark4>, to the <mark4>Towers</mark4><br>
Of Cockermouth that beauteous River <mark4>came,</mark4><br>
Behind my Father's House he pass'd, close <mark3>by,</mark3><br>
Along the margin of our Terrace <mark3>Walk.</mark3><br>
He was a Playmate whom we dearly <mark1>lov'd.</mark1><br>
Oh! many a time have I, a five years' <mark4>Child,</mark4><br>
A naked Boy, in one delightful <mark3>Rill,</mark3><br>
A little Mill-race sever'd from his <mark1>stream,</mark1><br>
Made one long bathing of a summer's <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
Bask'd in the sun, and plunged, and bask'd <mark4>again</mark4><br>
Alternate all a summer's day, or cours'd <br>
Over the sandy <mark4>fields</mark4>, leaping through <mark1>groves</mark1><br>
Of yellow grunsel, or when crag and <mark3>hill,</mark3><br>
The woods, and distant Skiddaw's lofty <mark4>height,</mark4><br>
Were bronz'd with a deep radiance, stood <mark4>alone</mark4><br>
Beneath the sky, as if I had been <mark4>born</mark4><br>
On Indian Plains, and from my Mother's <mark4>hut</mark4><br>
Had run abroad in wantonness, to <mark4>sport,</mark4><br>
A naked Savage, in the thunder <mark4>shower.</mark4><br>
<br>
Fair seed-time had my soul, and I grew <mark4>up</mark4><br>
Foster'd alike by beauty and by <mark3>fear;</mark3><br>
Much favour'd in my <mark4>birthplace</mark4>, and no <mark4>less</mark4><br>
In that beloved Vale to which, erelong, <br>
I was <mark4>transplanted</mark4>, Well I call to <mark4>mind</mark4><br>
('Twas at an early age, ere I had <mark4>seen</mark4><br>
Nine summers) when upon the mountain <mark4>slope</mark4><br>
The frost and breath of frosty wind had <mark4>snapp'd</mark4><br>
The last autumnal crocus, 'twas my <mark3>joy</mark3><br>
To wander half the night among the <mark4>Cliffs</mark4><br>
And the smooth Hollows, where the woodcocks <mark4>ran</mark4><br>
Along the open turf. In thought and wish <br>
That time, my shoulder all with springes <mark4>hung,</mark4><br>
I was a fell destroyer. On the <mark4>heights</mark4><br>
Scudding away from snare to snare, I <mark4>plied</mark4><br>
My anxious <mark4>visitation</mark4>, hurrying <mark4>on,</mark4><br>
Still hurrying, hurrying onward; moon and <mark4>stars</mark4><br>
Were shining o'er my head; I was <mark1>alone,</mark1><br>
And seem'd to be a trouble to the <mark4>peace</mark4><br>
That was among them. Sometimes it befel <br>
In these night-wanderings, that a strong <mark4>desire</mark4><br>
O'erpower'd my better reason, and the <mark4>bird</mark4><br>
Which was the captive of another's <mark4>toils</mark4><br>
Became my prey; and, when the deed was <mark4>done</mark4><br>
I heard among the solitary <mark4>hills</mark4><br>
Low breathings coming after me, and <mark4>sounds</mark4><br>
Of undistinguishable motion, <mark4>steps</mark4><br>
Almost as silent as the turf they <mark4>trod.</mark4><br>
Nor less in springtime when on southern <mark4>banks</mark4><br>
The shining sun had from his knot of <mark4>leaves</mark4><br>
Decoy'd the primrose flower, and when the <mark4>Vales</mark4><br>
And woods were warm, was I a plunderer <mark4>then</mark4><br>
In the high places, on the lonesome <mark4>peaks</mark4><br>
<mark4>Where'er</mark4>, among the mountains and the <mark4>winds,</mark4><br>
The Mother Bird had built her lodge. Though <mark4>mean</mark4><br>
My object, and inglorious, yet the <mark4>end</mark4><br>
Was not ignoble. Oh! when I have <mark1>hung</mark1><br>
Above the raven's nest, by knots of <mark4>grass</mark4><br>
And half-inch fissures in the slippery <mark3>rock</mark3><br>
But ill sustain'd, and almost, as it <mark4>seem'd,</mark4><br>
Suspended by the blast which blew amain, <br>
Shouldering the naked crag; Oh! at that <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
While on the perilous ridge I hung <mark1>alone,</mark1><br>
With what strange utterance did the loud dry <mark4>wind</mark4><br>
Blow through my ears! the sky seem'd not a <mark3>sky</mark3><br>
Of earth, and with what motion mov'd the <mark4>clouds!</mark4><br>
<br>
The mind of Man is fram'd even like the <mark4>breath</mark4><br>
And harmony of <mark4>music</mark4>, There is a <mark4>dark</mark4><br>
Invisible workmanship that <mark4>reconciles</mark4><br>
Discordant elements, and makes them <mark4>move</mark4><br>
In one society. Ah me! that <mark4>all</mark4><br>
The <mark4>terrors</mark4>, all the early <mark4>miseries</mark4><br>
Regrets, vexations, lassitudes, that <mark1>all</mark1><br>
The thoughts and feelings which have been infus'd <br>
Into my mind, should ever have made <mark1>up</mark1><br>
The calm existence that is mine when <mark3>I</mark3><br>
Am worthy of myself! Praise to the <mark1>end!</mark1><br>
Thanks likewise for the means! But I <mark4>believe</mark4><br>
That Nature, oftentimes, when she would <mark4>frame</mark4><br>
A favor'd Being, from his earliest <mark4>dawn</mark4><br>
Of infancy doth open out the <mark1>clouds,</mark1><br>
As at the touch of lightning, seeking <mark4>him</mark4><br>
With gentlest visitation; not the <mark1>less,</mark1><br>
Though haply aiming at the self-same <mark1>end,</mark1><br>
Does it delight her sometimes to <mark3>employ</mark3><br>
Severer interventions, <mark5>ministry</mark5><br>
More palpable, and so she dealt with <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
<br>
One evening (surely I was led by <mark3>her)</mark3><br>
I went alone into a Shepherd's <mark4>Boat,</mark4><br>
A Skiff that to a Willow tree was <mark4>tied</mark4><br>
Within a rocky Cave, its usual <mark4>home.</mark4><br>
'Twas by the shores of Patterdale, a <mark4>Vale</mark4><br>
Wherein I was a Stranger, thither <mark4>come</mark4><br>
A School-boy Traveller, at the <mark4>Holidays.</mark4><br>
Forth rambled from the Village Inn <mark1>alone</mark1><br>
No sooner had I sight of this small <mark3>Skiff,</mark3><br>
Discover'd thus by unexpected <mark4>chance,</mark4><br>
Than I unloos'd her tether and <mark4>embark'd.</mark4><br>
The moon was up, the Lake was shining <mark3>clear</mark3><br>
Among the hoary mountains; from the <mark4>Shore</mark4><br>
I push'd, and struck the oars and struck <mark1>again</mark1><br>
In cadence, and my little Boat mov'd <mark1>on</mark1><br>
Even like a Man who walks with stately <mark4>step</mark4><br>
Though bent on speed. It was an act of <mark4>stealth</mark4><br>
And troubled pleasure; not without the <mark1>voice</mark1><br>
Of mountain-echoes did my Boat move <mark1>on,</mark1><br>
Leaving behind her still on either <mark3>side</mark3><br>
Small circles glittering idly in the <mark4>moon,</mark4><br>
Until they melted all into one <mark4>track</mark4><br>
Of sparkling light. A rocky Steep uprose <br>
Above the Cavern of the Willow <mark3>tree</mark3><br>
And now, as suited one who proudly <mark4>row'd</mark4><br>
With his best skill, I fix'd a steady <mark3>view</mark3><br>
Upon the top of that same craggy <mark4>ridge,</mark4><br>
The bound of the horizon, for <mark4>behind</mark4><br>
Was nothing but the stars and the grey <mark1>sky.</mark1><br>
She was an elfin Pinnace; lustily <br>
I dipp'd my oars into the silent <mark4>Lake,</mark4><br>
And, as I rose upon the stroke, my <mark1>Boat</mark1><br>
Went heaving through the water, like a <mark4>Swan;</mark4><br>
When from behind that craggy Steep, till <mark1>then</mark1><br>
The bound of the horizon, a huge <mark3>Cliff,</mark3><br>
As if with voluntary power <mark4>instinct,</mark4><br>
Uprear'd its head. I struck, and struck <mark1>again</mark1><br>
And, growing still in stature, the huge <mark1>Cliff</mark1><br>
Rose up between me and the stars, and <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
With measur'd motion, like a living <mark4>thing,</mark4><br>
Strode after me. With trembling hands I <mark4>turn'd,</mark4><br>
And through the silent water stole my <mark3>way</mark3><br>
Back to the Cavern of the Willow <mark1>tree.</mark1><br>
There, in her mooring-place, I left my <mark4>Bark,</mark4><br>
And, through the meadows homeward went, with <mark4>grave</mark4><br>
And serious thoughts; and after I had <mark1>seen</mark1><br>
That spectacle, for many days, my <mark4>brain</mark4><br>
Work'd with a dim and undetermin'd <mark4>sense</mark4><br>
Of unknown modes of being; in my <mark1>thoughts</mark1><br>
There was a darkness, call it <mark4>solitude,</mark4><br>
Or blank desertion, no familiar <mark4>shapes</mark4><br>
Of hourly objects, images of <mark4>trees,</mark4><br>
Of sea or sky, no colours of green <mark4>fields;</mark4><br>
But huge and mighty Forms that do not <mark4>live</mark4><br>
Like living men mov'd slowly through the <mark1>mind</mark1><br>
By day and were the trouble of my <mark4>dreams.</mark4><br>
<br>
Wisdom and Spirit of the <mark4>universe!</mark4><br>
Thou Soul that art the eternity of <mark4>thought!</mark4><br>
That giv'st to forms and images a <mark1>breath</mark1><br>
And everlasting motion! not in <mark3>vain,</mark3><br>
By day or star-light thus from my first <mark1>dawn</mark1><br>
Of Childhood didst Thou intertwine for <mark1>me</mark1><br>
The passions that build up our human <mark4>Soul,</mark4><br>
Not with the mean and vulgar works of <mark4>Man,</mark4><br>
But with high objects, with enduring <mark4>things,</mark4><br>
With life and nature, purifying <mark4>thus</mark4><br>
The elements of feeling and of <mark1>thought,</mark1><br>
And sanctifying, by such <mark4>discipline,</mark4><br>
Both pain and fear, until we <mark4>recognize</mark4><br>
A grandeur in the beatings of the <mark4>heart.</mark4><br>
<br>
Nor was this fellowship vouchsaf'd to <mark1>me</mark1><br>
With stinted kindness. In November <mark4>days,</mark4><br>
When vapours, rolling down the valleys, <mark4>made</mark4><br>
A lonely scene more lonesome; among <mark4>woods</mark4><br>
At noon, and 'mid the calm of summer <mark4>nights,</mark4><br>
When, by the margin of the trembling <mark1>Lake,</mark1><br>
Beneath the gloomy hills I homeward <mark4>went</mark4><br>
In solitude, such intercourse was <mark4>mine;</mark4><br>
'Twas mine among the fields both day and <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
And by the waters all the summer <mark4>long.</mark4><br>
<br>
And in the frosty <mark4>season</mark4>, when the <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
Was set, and visible for many a <mark4>mile</mark4><br>
The cottage windows through the twilight blaz'd, <br>
I heeded not the summons:--happy <mark1>time</mark1><br>
It was, indeed, for all of us; to <mark1>me</mark1><br>
It was a time of rapture: clear and <mark4>loud</mark4><br>
The village clock toll'd six; I wheel'd <mark4>about,</mark4><br>
Proud and exulting, like an untired <mark4>horse,</mark4><br>
That cares not for its home.--All shod with <mark4>steel,</mark4><br>
We hiss'd along the polish'd ice, in <mark4>games</mark4><br>
Confederate, imitative of the <mark4>chace</mark4><br>
And woodland pleasures, the resounding <mark4>horn,</mark4><br>
The Pack loud bellowing, and the hunted <mark4>hare.</mark4><br>
So through the darkness and the cold we <mark3>flew,</mark3><br>
And not a voice was idle; with the <mark4>din,</mark4><br>
Meanwhile, the precipices rang <mark3>aloud,</mark3><br>
The leafless trees, and every icy <mark5>crag</mark5><br>
Tinkled like iron, while the distant <mark1>hills</mark1><br>
Into the tumult sent an alien <mark4>sound</mark4><br>
Of melancholy, not unnoticed, while the <mark1>stars,</mark1><br>
Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the <mark4>west</mark4><br>
The orange sky of evening died <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
<br>
Not seldom from the uproar I <mark4>retired</mark4><br>
Into a silent bay, or <mark5>sportively</mark5><br>
Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous <mark3>throng,</mark3><br>
To cut across the image of a <mark4>star</mark4><br>
That gleam'd upon the ice: and <mark4>oftentimes</mark4><br>
When we had given our bodies to the <mark1>wind,</mark1><br>
And all the shadowy banks, on either <mark1>side,</mark1><br>
Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning <mark1>still</mark1><br>
The rapid line of motion; then at <mark4>once</mark4><br>
Have I, reclining back upon my <mark4>heels,</mark4><br>
Stopp'd short, yet still the solitary <mark1>Cliffs</mark1><br>
Wheeled by me, even as if the earth had <mark4>roll'd</mark4><br>
With visible motion her diurnal <mark4>round;</mark4><br>
Behind me did they stretch in solemn <mark4>train</mark4><br>
Feebler and feebler, and I stood and <mark4>watch'd</mark4><br>
Till all was tranquil as a dreamless <mark4>sleep.</mark4><br>
<br>
Ye Presences of Nature, in the <mark1>sky</mark1><br>
And on the earth! Ye Visions of the <mark1>hills!</mark1><br>
And Souls of lonely places! can I <mark4>think</mark4><br>
A vulgar hope was yours when Ye <mark4>employ'd</mark4><br>
Such ministry, when Ye through many a <mark4>year</mark4><br>
Haunting me thus among my boyish <mark4>sports,</mark4><br>
On caves and <mark4>trees</mark4>, upon the woods and <mark1>hills,</mark1><br>
Impress'd upon all forms the <mark4>characters</mark4><br>
Of danger or desire, and thus did <mark4>make</mark4><br>
The surface of the universal <mark4>earth</mark4><br>
With triumph, and delight, and hope, and <mark1>fear,</mark1><br>
Work like a <mark3>sea?</mark3><br>
<br>
Not uselessly <mark1>employ'd,</mark1><br>
I might pursue this theme through every <mark4>change</mark4><br>
Of exercise and play, to which the <mark1>year</mark1><br>
Did summon us in its delightful <mark1>round.</mark1><br>
<br>
We were a noisy crew, the sun in <mark4>heaven</mark4><br>
Beheld not vales more beautiful than <mark4>ours,</mark4><br>
Nor saw a race in happiness and <mark1>joy</mark1><br>
More worthy of the ground where they were <mark4>sown.</mark4><br>
I would record with no reluctant <mark1>voice</mark1><br>
The woods of autumn and their hazel <mark3>bowers</mark3><br>
With milk-white clusters hung; the rod and <mark4>line,</mark4><br>
True symbol of the foolishness of <mark4>hope,</mark4><br>
Which with its strong enchantment led us <mark1>on</mark1><br>
By rocks and pools, shut out from every <mark1>star</mark1><br>
All the green summer, to forlorn <mark4>cascades</mark4><br>
Among the windings of the mountain <mark4>brooks.</mark4><br>
--Unfading recollections! at this <mark4>hour</mark4><br>
The heart is almost mine with which I <mark4>felt</mark4><br>
From some hill-top, on sunny <mark4>afternoons</mark4><br>
The Kite high up among the fleecy <mark1>clouds</mark1><br>
Pull at its rein, like an impatient <mark4>Courser,</mark4><br>
Or, from the meadows sent on gusty <mark1>days,</mark1><br>
Beheld her breast the wind, then <mark4>suddenly</mark4><br>
Dash'd headlong; and rejected by the <mark4>storm.</mark4><br>
<br>
Ye lowly Cottages in which we <mark3>dwelt,</mark3><br>
A ministration of your own was <mark4>yours,</mark4><br>
A sanctity, a safeguard, and a <mark4>love!</mark4><br>
Can I forget you, being as ye <mark3>were</mark3><br>
So beautiful among the pleasant <mark1>fields</mark1><br>
In which ye stood? Or can I here <mark4>forget</mark4><br>
The plain and seemly countenance with <mark4>which</mark4><br>
Ye dealt out your plain comforts? Yet had <mark3>ye</mark3><br>
Delights and exultations of your <mark4>own.</mark4><br>
Eager and never weary we <mark4>pursued</mark4><br>
Our home amusements by the warm <mark4>peat-fire</mark4><br>
At evening; when with pencil and with <mark4>slate,</mark4><br>
In square divisions parcell'd out, and <mark1>all</mark1><br>
With crosses and with cyphers scribbled <mark4>o'er,</mark4><br>
We schemed and <mark4>puzzled</mark4>, head opposed to <mark4>head</mark4><br>
In strife too humble to be named in <mark4>Verse.</mark4><br>
Or round the naked <mark4>table</mark4>, snow-white <mark4>deal,</mark4><br>
Cherry or maple, sate in close <mark3>array,</mark3><br>
And to the combat, Lu or Whist, led <mark1>on</mark1><br>
thick-ribbed Army; not as in the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
Neglected and ungratefully thrown <mark1>by</mark1><br>
Even for the very service they had <mark4>wrought,</mark4><br>
But husbanded through many a long <mark4>campaign.</mark4><br>
Uncouth assemblage was it, where no <mark3>few</mark3><br>
Had changed their functions, some, plebeian <mark4>cards,</mark4><br>
Which Fate beyond the promise of their <mark3>birth</mark3><br>
Had glorified, and call'd to <mark4>represent</mark4><br>
The persons of departed <mark4>Potentates.</mark4><br>
Oh! with what echoes on the Board they <mark4>fell!</mark4><br>
Ironic <mark4>Diamonds</mark4>, Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds, <mark4>Spades,</mark4><br>
A congregation piteously <mark4>akin.</mark4><br>
Cheap matter did they give to boyish <mark4>wit,</mark4><br>
Those sooty knaves, precipitated <mark4>down</mark4><br>
With scoffs and taunts, like Vulcan out of <mark1>Heaven,</mark1><br>
The paramount <mark4>Ace</mark4>, a moon in her <mark4>eclipse,</mark4><br>
Queens, gleaming through their splendour's last <mark3>decay,</mark3><br>
And Monarchs, surly at the wrongs <mark4>sustain'd</mark4><br>
By royal visages. Meanwhile, <mark4>abroad</mark4><br>
The heavy rain was falling, or the <mark4>frost</mark4><br>
Raged bitterly, with keen and silent <mark4>tooth,</mark4><br>
And, interrupting oft the impassion'd <mark4>game,</mark4><br>
From Esthwaite's neighbouring Lake the splitting <mark4>ice,</mark4><br>
While it sank down towards the water, <mark4>sent,</mark4><br>
Among the meadows and the hills, its <mark1>long</mark1><br>
And dismal yellings, like the noise of <mark4>wolves</mark4><br>
When they are howling round the Bothnic <mark4>Main.</mark4><br>
<br>
Nor, sedulous as I have been to <mark4>trace</mark4><br>
How Nature by extrinsic passion <mark4>first</mark4><br>
Peopled my mind with beauteous forms or <mark4>grand,</mark4><br>
And made me love them, may I well <mark1>forget</mark1><br>
How other pleasures have been mine, and <mark4>joys</mark4><br>
Of subtler origin; how I have <mark1>felt,</mark1><br>
Not <mark4>seldom</mark4>, even in that tempestuous <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
Those hallow'd and pure motions of the <mark1>sense</mark1><br>
Which seem, in their simplicity, to <mark1>own</mark1><br>
An intellectual charm, that calm <mark4>delight</mark4><br>
Which, if I err not, surely must <mark3>belong</mark3><br>
To those first-born affinities that <mark4>fit</mark4><br>
Our new existence to existing <mark1>things,</mark1><br>
And, in our dawn of being, <mark4>constitute</mark4><br>
The bond of union betwixt life and <mark1>joy.</mark1><br>
<br>
Yes, I remember, when the changeful <mark1>earth,</mark1><br>
And twice five seasons on my mind had <mark4>stamp'd</mark4><br>
The faces of the moving year, even <mark1>then,</mark1><br>
A Child, I held unconscious <mark4>intercourse</mark4><br>
With the eternal Beauty, drinking <mark4>in</mark4><br>
A pure organic pleasure from the <mark4>lines</mark4><br>
Of curling mist, or from the level <mark4>plain</mark4><br>
Of waters colour'd by the steady <mark1>clouds.</mark1><br>
<br>
The Sands of Westmoreland, the Creeks and <mark4>Bays</mark4><br>
Of Cumbria's rocky limits, they can <mark3>tell</mark3><br>
How when the Sea threw off his evening <mark4>shade</mark4><br>
And to the Shepherd's huts beneath the <mark5>crags</mark5><br>
Did send sweet notice of the rising <mark1>moon,</mark1><br>
How I have stood, to fancies such as <mark4>these,</mark4><br>
Engrafted in the tenderness of <mark1>thought,</mark1><br>
A stranger, linking with the <mark4>spectacle</mark4><br>
No conscious memory of a kindred <mark4>sight,</mark4><br>
And bringing with me no peculiar <mark1>sense</mark1><br>
Of quietness or peace, yet I have <mark4>stood,</mark4><br>
Even while mine eye has mov'd o'er three long <mark4>leagues</mark4><br>
Of shining water, gathering, as it <mark1>seem'd,</mark1><br>
Through every hair-breadth of that field of <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
New pleasure, like a bee among the <mark4>flowers.</mark4><br>
<br>
Thus, often in those fits of vulgar <mark1>joy</mark1><br>
Which, through all seasons, on a child's <mark4>pursuits</mark4><br>
Are prompt <mark4>attendants</mark4>, 'mid that giddy <mark4>bliss</mark4><br>
Which, like a tempest, works along the <mark4>blood</mark4><br>
And is forgotten; even then I <mark1>felt</mark1><br>
Gleams like the flashing of a shield; the <mark1>earth</mark1><br>
And common face of Nature spake to <mark1>me</mark1><br>
Rememberable things; sometimes, 'tis <mark3>true,</mark3><br>
By chance collisions and quaint <mark4>accidents</mark4><br>
Like those ill-sorted unions, work suppos'd <br>
Of evil-minded fairies, yet not <mark1>vain</mark1><br>
Nor profitless, if haply they <mark4>impress'd</mark4><br>
Collateral objects and <mark4>appearances,</mark4><br>
Albeit lifeless then, and doom'd to <mark1>sleep</mark1><br>
Until maturer seasons call'd them <mark4>forth</mark4><br>
To impregnate and to elevate the <mark1>mind.</mark1><br>
--And if the vulgar joy by its own <mark4>weight</mark4><br>
Wearied itself out of the <mark4>memory,</mark4><br>
The scenes which were a witness of that <mark1>joy</mark1><br>
Remained, in their substantial <mark5>lineaments</mark5><br>
Depicted on the brain, and to the <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
Were visible, a daily sight; and <mark1>thus</mark1><br>
By the impressive discipline of <mark1>fear,</mark1><br>
By pleasure and repeated <mark4>happiness,</mark4><br>
So frequently repeated, and by <mark4>force</mark4><br>
Of obscure feelings <mark4>representative</mark4><br>
Of joys that were forgotten, these same <mark4>scenes,</mark4><br>
So beauteous and majestic in <mark4>themselves,</mark4><br>
Though yet the day was distant, did at <mark4>length</mark4><br>
Become habitually dear, and <mark1>all</mark1><br>
Their hues and forms were by invisible <mark4>links</mark4><br>
Allied to the <mark4>affections.</mark4><br>
<br>
I <mark4>began</mark4><br>
My story early, feeling as I <mark1>fear,</mark1><br>
The weakness of a human love, for <mark1>days</mark1><br>
Disown'd by memory, ere the birth of <mark4>spring</mark4><br>
Planting my snowdrops among winter <mark4>snows.</mark4><br>
Nor will it seem to thee, my Friend! so <mark4>prompt</mark4><br>
In sympathy, that I have lengthen'd <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
With fond and feeble tongue, a tedious <mark4>tale.</mark4><br>
Meanwhile, my hope has been that I might <mark4>fetch</mark4><br>
Invigorating thoughts from former <mark4>years,</mark4><br>
Might fix the wavering balance of my <mark1>wind,</mark1><br>
And haply meet reproaches, too, whose <mark4>power</mark4><br>
May spur me on, in manhood now <mark4>mature,</mark4><br>
To honorable toil. Yet should these <mark4>hopes</mark4><br>
Be vain, and thus should neither I be <mark4>taught</mark4><br>
To understand myself, nor thou to know <br>
With better knowledge how the heart was <mark4>fram'd</mark4><br>
Of him thou lovest, need I dread from <mark3>thee</mark3><br>
Harsh judgments, if I am so loth to <mark4>quit</mark4><br>
Those recollected hours that have the <mark4>charm</mark4><br>
Of visionary <mark4>things</mark4>, and lovely <mark4>forms</mark4><br>
And sweet sensations that throw back our <mark4>life</mark4><br>
And almost make our Infancy <mark4>itself</mark4><br>
A visible scene, on which the sun is <mark4>shining?</mark4><br>
<br>
One end hereby at least hath been <mark4>attain'd,</mark4><br>
My mind hath been <mark4>revived</mark4>, and if this <mark4>mood</mark4><br>
Desert me not, I will forthwith bring <mark1>down,</mark1><br>
Through later years, the story of my <mark1>life.</mark1><br>
The road lies plain before me; 'tis a <mark4>theme</mark4><br>
Single and of determined bounds; and <mark4>hence</mark4><br>
I chuse it rather at this time, than <mark4>work</mark4><br>
Of ampler or more varied <mark4>argument.</mark4><br>
