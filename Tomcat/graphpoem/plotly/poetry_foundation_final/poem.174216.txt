Title : A Barefoot Boy <br>
Author : James Whitcomb Riley <br><br>

A barefoot boy! I mark him at his <mark3>play?</mark3><br>
For May is here once more, and so is <mark3>he,?</mark3><br>
His dusty trousers, rolled half to the <mark3>knee,</mark3><br>
And his bare ankles grimy, too, as <mark3>they:</mark3><br>
Cross-hatchings of the nettle, in <mark3>array</mark3><br>
Of feverish stripes, hint vividly to <mark3>me</mark3><br>
Of woody pathways winding <mark4>endlessly</mark4><br>
Along the creek, where even <mark4>yesterday</mark4><br>
He plunged his shrinking body?gasped and <mark4>shook?</mark4><br>
Yet called the water "warm," with never <mark4>lack</mark4><br>
Of joy. And so, half enviously I <mark4>look</mark4><br>
Upon this graceless barefoot and his <mark4>track,?</mark4><br>
His toe stubbed?ay, his big toe-nail knocked <mark3>back</mark3><br>
Like unto the clasp of an old <mark4>pocketbook.</mark4><br>
