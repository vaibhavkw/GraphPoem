Title : Cleon <br>
Author : Robert Browning <br><br>

"As certain also of your own poets have said"-- (Acts 17.28) <br>
Cleon the poet (from the sprinkled <mark4>isles,</mark4><br>
Lily on lily, that o'erlace the <mark3>sea</mark3><br>
And laugh their pride when the light wave lisps <mark4>"Greece")--</mark4><br>
To Protus in his Tyranny: much <mark4>health!</mark4><br>
<br>
They give thy letter to me, even <mark3>now:</mark3><br>
I read and seem as if I heard thee <mark4>speak.</mark4><br>
The master of thy galley still unlades <br>
Gift after <mark4>gift</mark4>, they block my court at <mark4>last</mark4><br>
And pile themselves along its portico <br>
Royal with sunset, like a thought of <mark3>thee:</mark3><br>
And one white she-slave from the group <mark4>dispersed</mark4><br>
Of black and white slaves (like the <mark4>chequer-work</mark4><br>
<mark4>Pavement</mark4>, at once my nation's work and <mark4>gift,</mark4><br>
Now covered with this settle-down of <mark4>doves),</mark4><br>
One lyric woman, in her crocus <mark4>vest</mark4><br>
Woven of <mark4>sea-wools</mark4>, with her two white <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
Commends to me the strainer and the <mark4>cup</mark4><br>
Thy lip hath bettered ere it blesses <mark4>mine.</mark4><br>
<br>
    Well-counselled, king, in thy munificence! <br>
For so shall men remark, in such an <mark4>act</mark4><br>
Of love for him whose song gives life its <mark1>joy,--</mark1><br>
Thy recognition of the use of <mark4>life;</mark4><br>
Nor call thy spirit barely <mark4>adequate</mark4><br>
To help on life in straight ways, broad <mark4>enough</mark4><br>
For vulgar souls, by ruling and the <mark4>rest.</mark4><br>
Thou, in the daily building of thy <mark3>tower,--</mark3><br>
Whether in fierce and sudden spasms of <mark4>toil,</mark4><br>
Or through dim lulls of unapparent <mark4>growth,</mark4><br>
Or when the general work 'mid good <mark4>acclaim</mark4><br>
Climbed with the eye to cheer the <mark4>architect,--</mark4><br>
Didst ne'er engage in work for mere work's <mark4>sake--</mark4><br>
Hadst ever in thy heart the luring <mark4>hope</mark4><br>
Of some eventual rest a-top of <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
Whence, all the tumult of the building <mark4>hushed,</mark4><br>
Thou first of men might'st look out to the <mark4>East:</mark4><br>
The vulgar saw thy tower, thou sawest the <mark4>sun.</mark4><br>
For this, I promise on thy <mark4>festival</mark4><br>
To pour libation, looking o'er the <mark1>sea,</mark1><br>
Making this slave narrate thy fortunes, <mark1>speak</mark1><br>
Thy great words, and describe thy royal <mark4>face--</mark4><br>
Wishing thee wholly where Zeus lives the <mark4>most,</mark4><br>
Within the eventual element of <mark4>calm.</mark4><br>
<br>
Thy letter's first requirement meets me <mark4>here.</mark4><br>
It is as thou hast heard: in one short <mark1>life</mark1><br>
I, Cleon, have effected all those <mark4>things</mark4><br>
Thou wonderingly dost <mark4>enumerate.</mark4><br>
That epos on thy hundred plates of <mark4>gold</mark4><br>
Is mine,--and also mine the little <mark4>chant,</mark4><br>
So sure to rise from every <mark4>fishing-bark</mark4><br>
When, lights at prow, the seamen haul their <mark4>net.</mark4><br>
The image of the sun-god on the phare, <br>
Men turn from the sun's self to see, is <mark1>mine;</mark1><br>
The Poecile o'er-storied its whole <mark4>length,</mark4><br>
As thou didst hear, with painting, is mine <mark3>too.</mark3><br>
I know the true proportions of a <mark4>man</mark4><br>
And woman also, not observed <mark4>before;</mark4><br>
And I have written three books on the <mark4>soul,</mark4><br>
Proving absurd all written <mark3>hitherto,</mark3><br>
And putting us to ignorance <mark4>again.</mark4><br>
For music,--why, I have combined the <mark4>moods,</mark4><br>
Inventing one. In brief, all arts are <mark1>mine;</mark1><br>
Thus much the people know and <mark4>recognize,</mark4><br>
Throughout our seventeen islands. Marvel <mark4>not.</mark4><br>
We of these latter days, with greater <mark4>mind</mark4><br>
Than our forerunners, since more <mark4>composite,</mark4><br>
Look not so great, beside their simple <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
To a judge who only sees one way at <mark4>once,</mark4><br>
One mind-point and no other at a <mark4>time,--</mark4><br>
Compares the small part of a man of <mark4>us</mark4><br>
With some whole man of the heroic <mark4>age,</mark4><br>
Great in his way--not <mark1>ours</mark1>, nor meant for <mark4>ours.</mark4><br>
And ours is greater, had we skill to <mark3>know:</mark3><br>
For, what we call this life of men on <mark4>earth,</mark4><br>
This sequence of the soul's achievements <mark1>here</mark1><br>
Being, as I find much reason to <mark4>conceive,</mark4><br>
Intended to be viewed <mark4>eventually</mark4><br>
As a great whole, not analyzed to <mark4>parts,</mark4><br>
But each part having reference to <mark4>all,--</mark4><br>
How shall a certain <mark4>part</mark4>, pronounced <mark4>complete,</mark4><br>
Endure effacement by another <mark4>part?</mark4><br>
Was the thing done?--then, what's to do <mark1>again?</mark1><br>
See, in the chequered pavement <mark4>opposite,</mark4><br>
Suppose the artist made a perfect rhomb, <br>
And next a lozenge, then a trapezoid-- <br>
He did not overlay them, <mark4>superimpose</mark4><br>
The new upon the old and blot it <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
But laid them on a level in his <mark4>work,</mark4><br>
Making at last a picture; there it <mark4>lies.</mark4><br>
So, first the perfect separate forms were <mark4>made,</mark4><br>
The portions of mankind; and after, <mark3>so,</mark3><br>
Occurred the combination of the <mark4>same.</mark4><br>
For where had been a progress, <mark4>otherwise?</mark4><br>
Mankind, made up of all the single <mark3>men,--</mark3><br>
In such a synthesis the labour <mark4>ends.</mark4><br>
Now mark me! those divine men of old <mark1>time</mark1><br>
Have reached, thou sayest well, each at one <mark4>point</mark4><br>
The outside verge that rounds our <mark4>faculty;</mark4><br>
And where they reached, who can do more than <mark4>reach?</mark4><br>
It takes but little water just to <mark4>touch</mark4><br>
At some one point the inside of a <mark4>sphere,</mark4><br>
And, as we turn the sphere, touch all the <mark1>rest</mark1><br>
In due succession: but the finer <mark4>air</mark4><br>
Which not so palpably nor <mark4>obviously,</mark4><br>
Though no less universally, can <mark1>touch</mark1><br>
The whole circumference of that emptied <mark1>sphere,</mark1><br>
Fills it more fully than the water <mark4>did;</mark4><br>
Holds thrice the weight of water in <mark4>itself</mark4><br>
Resolved into a subtler <mark4>element.</mark4><br>
And yet the vulgar call the sphere first <mark4>full</mark4><br>
Up to the visible height--and after, <mark4>void;</mark4><br>
Not knowing air's more hidden <mark4>properties.</mark4><br>
And thus our soul, misknown, cries out to <mark4>Zeus</mark4><br>
To vindicate his purpose in our <mark1>life:</mark1><br>
Why stay we on the earth unless to <mark3>grow?</mark3><br>
Long since, I imaged, wrote the fiction <mark1>out,</mark1><br>
That he or other god descended <mark1>here</mark1><br>
And, once for all, showed <mark4>simultaneously</mark4><br>
What, in its nature, never can be <mark4>shown,</mark4><br>
Piecemeal or in succession;--showed, I <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
The worth both absolute and <mark4>relative</mark4><br>
Of all his children from the birth of <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
His instruments for all appointed <mark1>work.</mark1><br>
I now go on to image,--might we <mark2>hear</mark2><br>
The judgment which should give the due to <mark4>each,</mark4><br>
Show where the labour lay and where the <mark4>ease,</mark4><br>
And prove Zeus' self, the latent <mark4>everywhere!</mark4><br>
This is a dream:--but no dream, let us <mark1>hope,</mark1><br>
That years and <mark4>days</mark4>, the summers and the <mark4>springs,</mark4><br>
Follow each other with unwaning <mark4>powers.</mark4><br>
The grapes which dye thy wine are richer <mark4>far,</mark4><br>
Through culture, than the wild wealth of the <mark4>rock;</mark4><br>
The suave plum than the savage-tasted <mark4>drupe;</mark4><br>
The pastured honey-bee drops choicer <mark4>sweet;</mark4><br>
The flowers turn double, and the leaves turn <mark3>flowers;</mark3><br>
That young and tender crescent-moon, thy <mark4>slave,</mark4><br>
Sleeping above her robe as buoyed by <mark4>clouds,</mark4><br>
Refines upon the women of my <mark4>youth.</mark4><br>
What, and the soul alone <mark4>deteriorates?</mark4><br>
I have not chanted verse like Homer, <mark3>no--</mark3><br>
Nor swept string like Terpander, no--nor <mark4>carved</mark4><br>
And painted men like Phidias and his <mark4>friend:</mark4><br>
I am not great as they are, point by <mark1>point.</mark1><br>
But I have entered into <mark4>sympathy</mark4><br>
With these four, running these into one <mark1>soul,</mark1><br>
Who, <mark4>separate</mark4>, ignored each other's <mark4>art.</mark4><br>
Say, is it nothing that I know them <mark1>all?</mark1><br>
The wild flower was the larger; I have <mark4>dashed</mark4><br>
Rose-blood upon its <mark4>petals</mark4>, pricked its <mark4>cup's</mark4><br>
Honey with wine, and driven its seed to <mark4>fruit,</mark4><br>
And show a better flower if not so <mark4>large:</mark4><br>
I stand myself. Refer this to the <mark4>gods</mark4><br>
Whose gift alone it is! which, shall I <mark4>dare</mark4><br>
(All pride apart) upon the absurd <mark4>pretext</mark4><br>
That such a gift by chance lay in my <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
Discourse of lightly or <mark4>depreciate?</mark4><br>
It might have fallen to another's hand: what <mark4>then?</mark4><br>
I pass too surely: let at least truth <mark3>stay!</mark3><br>
<br>
And next, of what thou followest on to <mark4>ask.</mark4><br>
This being with me as I declare, O <mark5>king,</mark5><br>
My works, in all these varicoloured <mark4>kinds,</mark4><br>
So done by me, accepted so by <mark1>men--</mark1><br>
Thou askest, if (my soul thus in men's <mark4>hearts)</mark4><br>
I must not be accounted to <mark4>attain</mark4><br>
The very crown and proper end of <mark1>life?</mark1><br>
Inquiring thence how, now life closeth <mark4>up,</mark4><br>
I face death with success in my right <mark1>hand:</mark1><br>
Whether I fear death less than dost <mark4>thyself</mark4><br>
The fortunate of men? "For" (writest <mark3>thou)</mark3><br>
"Thou leavest much behind, while I leave nought. <br>
Thy life stays in the poems men shall <mark3>sing,</mark3><br>
The pictures men shall study; while my <mark1>life,</mark1><br>
Complete and whole now in its power and <mark1>joy,</mark1><br>
Dies altogether with my brain and <mark4>arm,</mark4><br>
Is lost indeed; since, what survives <mark4>myself?</mark4><br>
The brazen statue to o'erlook my <mark3>grave,</mark3><br>
Set on the promontory which I <mark4>named.</mark4><br>
And that--some supple courtier of my <mark3>heir</mark3><br>
Shall use its robed and sceptred arm, <mark4>perhaps,</mark4><br>
To fix the rope to, which best drags it <mark4>down.</mark4><br>
I go then: triumph thou, who dost not <mark3>go!"</mark3><br>
<br>
Nay, thou art worthy of hearing my whole <mark1>mind.</mark1><br>
Is this apparent, when thou turn'st to <mark4>muse</mark4><br>
Upon the scheme of earth and man in <mark4>chief,</mark4><br>
That admiration grows as knowledge <mark4>grows?</mark4><br>
That imperfection means perfection <mark4>hid,</mark4><br>
Reserved in part, to grace the <mark4>after-time?</mark4><br>
If, in the morning of <mark4>philosophy,</mark4><br>
Ere aught had been <mark4>recorded</mark4>, nay <mark4>perceived,</mark4><br>
Thou, with the light now in thee, couldst have <mark4>looked</mark4><br>
On all earth's tenantry, from worm to <mark4>bird,</mark4><br>
Ere man, her last, appeared upon the <mark4>stage--</mark4><br>
Thou wouldst have seen them <mark4>perfect</mark4>, and <mark4>deduced</mark4><br>
The perfectness of others yet <mark4>unseen.</mark4><br>
Conceding which,--had Zeus then questioned <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
"Shall I go on a step, improve on <mark4>this,</mark4><br>
Do more for visible creatures than is <mark4>done?"</mark4><br>
Thou wouldst have answered, "Ay, by making <mark1>each</mark1><br>
Grow conscious in himself--by that <mark4>alone.</mark4><br>
All's perfect else: the shell sucks fast the <mark1>rock,</mark1><br>
The fish strikes through the sea, the snake both <mark4>swims</mark4><br>
And slides, forth range the beasts, the birds take <mark4>flight,</mark4><br>
Till life's mechanics can no further <mark1>go--</mark1><br>
And all this joy in natural life is <mark4>put</mark4><br>
Like fire from off thy finger into <mark1>each,</mark1><br>
So exquisitely perfect is the <mark1>same.</mark1><br>
But 'tis pure <mark4>fire</mark4>, and they mere matter <mark4>are;</mark4><br>
It has them, not they it: and so I <mark4>choose</mark4><br>
For man, thy last premeditated <mark1>work</mark1><br>
(If I might add a glory to the <mark4>scheme),</mark4><br>
That a third thing should stand apart from <mark4>both,</mark4><br>
A quality arise within his <mark1>soul,</mark1><br>
Which, intro-active, made to <mark4>supervise</mark4><br>
And feel the force it has, may view <mark1>itself,</mark1><br>
And so be happy." Man might live at <mark4>first</mark4><br>
The animal life: but is there nothing <mark4>more?</mark4><br>
In due time, let him critically <mark4>learn</mark4><br>
How he lives; and, the more he gets to <mark1>know</mark1><br>
Of his own life's adaptabilities, <br>
The more joy-giving will his life <mark4>become.</mark4><br>
Thus man, who hath this quality, is <mark4>best.</mark4><br>
<br>
But thou, king, hadst more reasonably <mark4>said:</mark4><br>
"Let progress end at once,--man make no <mark4>step</mark4><br>
Beyond the natural man, the better <mark4>beast,</mark4><br>
Using his senses, not the sense of <mark4>sense."</mark4><br>
In man there's failure, only since he <mark4>left</mark4><br>
The lower and inconscious forms of <mark1>life.</mark1><br>
We called it an advance, the rendering <mark4>plain</mark4><br>
Man's spirit might grow conscious of man's <mark1>life,</mark1><br>
<mark4>And</mark4>, by new lore so added to the <mark4>old,</mark4><br>
Take each step higher over the brute's <mark4>head.</mark4><br>
This grew the only life, the <mark4>pleasure-house,</mark4><br>
Watch-tower and treasure-fortress of the <mark1>soul,</mark1><br>
Which whole surrounding flats of natural <mark1>life</mark1><br>
Seemed only fit to yield subsistence <mark3>to;</mark3><br>
A tower that crowns a country. But <mark4>alas,</mark4><br>
The soul now climbs it just to perish <mark4>there!</mark4><br>
For thence we have discovered ('tis no <mark4>dream--</mark4><br>
We know this, which we had not else <mark1>perceived)</mark1><br>
That there's a world of <mark4>capability</mark4><br>
For joy, spread round about <mark1>us</mark1>, meant for <mark1>us,</mark1><br>
Inviting us; and still the soul craves <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
And still the flesh replies, "Take no jot <mark1>more</mark1><br>
Than ere thou clombst the tower to look <mark4>abroad!</mark4><br>
Nay, so much less as that fatigue has <mark4>brought</mark4><br>
Deduction to it." We struggle, fain to <mark4>enlarge</mark4><br>
Our bounded physical <mark5>recipiency,</mark5><br>
Increase our power, supply fresh oil to <mark1>life,</mark1><br>
Repair the waste of age and sickness: <mark1>no,</mark1><br>
It skills not! life's inadequate to <mark1>joy,</mark1><br>
As the soul sees joy, tempting life to <mark4>take.</mark4><br>
They praise a fountain in my garden <mark1>here</mark1><br>
Wherein a Naiad sends the <mark3>water-bow</mark3><br>
Thin from her tube; she smiles to see it <mark4>rise.</mark4><br>
What if I told her, it is just a <mark4>thread</mark4><br>
From that great river which the hills shut <mark1>up,</mark1><br>
And mock her with my leave to take the <mark1>same?</mark1><br>
The artificer has given her one small tube <br>
Past power to widen or exchange--what <mark4>boots</mark4><br>
To know she might spout oceans if she <mark4>could?</mark4><br>
She cannot lift beyond her first thin <mark1>thread:</mark1><br>
And so a man can use but a man's <mark1>joy</mark1><br>
While he sees God's. Is it for Zeus to <mark4>boast,</mark4><br>
"See, man, how happy I live, and <mark4>despair--</mark4><br>
That I may be still happier--for thy <mark4>use!"</mark4><br>
If this were so, we could not thank our <mark4>lord,</mark4><br>
As hearts beat on to doing; 'tis not <mark1>so--</mark1><br>
Malice it is not. Is it <mark4>carelessness?</mark4><br>
Still, no. If care--where is the sign? I <mark1>ask,</mark1><br>
And get no answer, and agree in <mark4>sum,</mark4><br>
O king, with thy profound <mark4>discouragement,</mark4><br>
Who seest the wider but to sigh the <mark1>more.</mark1><br>
Most progress is most failure: thou sayest <mark4>well.</mark4><br>
<br>
The last point now:--thou dost except a <mark4>case--</mark4><br>
Holding joy not impossible to <mark4>one</mark4><br>
With artist-gifts--to such a man as <mark1>I</mark1><br>
Who leave behind me living works <mark4>indeed;</mark4><br>
For, such a poem, such a painting <mark4>lives.</mark4><br>
What? dost thou verily trip upon a <mark4>word,</mark4><br>
Confound the accurate view of what joy <mark4>is</mark4><br>
(Caught somewhat clearer by my eyes than <mark4>thine)</mark4><br>
With feeling joy? confound the knowing <mark3>how</mark3><br>
And showing how to live (my <mark1>faculty)</mark1><br>
With actually <mark5>living?--Otherwise</mark5><br>
Where is the artist's vantage o'er the <mark1>king?</mark1><br>
Because in my great epos I <mark3>display</mark3><br>
How divers men young, strong, fair, wise, can <mark1>act--</mark1><br>
Is this as though I acted? if I <mark4>paint,</mark4><br>
Carve the young Phoebus, am I therefore <mark4>young?</mark4><br>
Methinks I'm older that I bowed <mark1>myself</mark1><br>
The many years of pain that taught me <mark1>art!</mark1><br>
Indeed, to know is something, and to <mark4>prove</mark4><br>
How all this beauty might be enjoyed, is <mark1>more:</mark1><br>
But, knowing nought, to enjoy is something <mark1>too.</mark1><br>
Yon rower, with the moulded muscles <mark1>there,</mark1><br>
Lowering the sail, is nearer it than <mark1>I.</mark1><br>
I can write love-odes: thy fair slave's an <mark4>ode.</mark4><br>
I get to sing of love, when grown too <mark3>grey</mark3><br>
For being beloved: she turns to that young <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
The muscles all a-ripple on his <mark4>back.</mark4><br>
I know the joy of kingship: well, thou art <mark1>king!</mark1><br>
<br>
"But," sayest thou--(and I marvel, I <mark4>repeat,</mark4><br>
To find thee trip on such a mere word) <mark4>"what</mark4><br>
Thou writest, paintest, stays; that does not <mark3>die:</mark3><br>
Sappho <mark4>survives</mark4>, because we sing her <mark4>songs,</mark4><br>
And Aeschylus, because we read his <mark4>plays!"</mark4><br>
Why, if they live still, let them come and <mark1>take</mark1><br>
Thy slave in my despite, drink from thy <mark1>cup,</mark1><br>
Speak in my place. Thou diest while I <mark4>survive?</mark4><br>
Say rather that my fate is deadlier <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
In this, that every day my sense of <mark1>joy</mark1><br>
Grows more acute, my soul (intensified <br>
By power and insight) more enlarged, more <mark4>keen;</mark4><br>
While every day my hairs fall more and <mark1>more,</mark1><br>
My hand <mark4>shakes</mark4>, and the heavy years <mark4>increase--</mark4><br>
The horror quickening still from year to <mark4>year,</mark4><br>
The consummation coming past <mark4>escape,</mark4><br>
When I shall know most, and yet least <mark3>enjoy--</mark3><br>
When all my works wherein I prove my <mark4>worth,</mark4><br>
Being present still to mock me in men's <mark4>mouths,</mark4><br>
Alive still, in the praise of such as <mark1>thou,</mark1><br>
I, I the feeling, thinking, acting <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
The man who loved his life so <mark4>over-much,</mark4><br>
Sleep in my urn. It is so <mark4>horrible,</mark4><br>
I dare at times imagine to my <mark4>need</mark4><br>
Some future state revealed to us by <mark1>Zeus,</mark1><br>
Unlimited in <mark1>capability</mark1><br>
For <mark1>joy</mark1>, as this is in desire for <mark1>joy,</mark1><br>
--To seek which, the joy-hunger forces <mark1>us:</mark1><br>
That, stung by straitness of our life, made <mark4>strait</mark4><br>
On purpose to make prized the life at <mark1>large--</mark1><br>
Freed by the throbbing impulse we call <mark4>death,</mark4><br>
We burst there as the worm into the <mark3>fly,</mark3><br>
Who, while a worm still, wants his wings. But <mark1>no!</mark1><br>
Zeus has not yet revealed it; and <mark1>alas,</mark1><br>
He must have done so, were it <mark4>possible!</mark4><br>
<br>
Live long and happy, and in that thought <mark1>die:</mark1><br>
Glad for what was! Farewell. And for the <mark1>rest,</mark1><br>
I cannot tell thy messenger aright <br>
Where to deliver what he bears of <mark1>thine</mark1><br>
To one called Paulus; we have heard his <mark4>fame</mark4><br>
Indeed, if Christus be not one with <mark4>him--</mark4><br>
I know not, nor am troubled much to <mark1>know.</mark1><br>
Thou canst not think a mere barbarian <mark3>Jew,</mark3><br>
As Paulus proves to be, one <mark4>circumcised,</mark4><br>
Hath access to a secret shut from <mark1>us?</mark1><br>
Thou wrongest our philosophy, O <mark1>king,</mark1><br>
In stooping to inquire of such an <mark1>one,</mark1><br>
As if his answer could impose at <mark1>all!</mark1><br>
He writeth, doth he? well, and he may <mark4>write.</mark4><br>
Oh, the Jew findeth scholars! certain <mark4>slaves</mark4><br>
Who touched on this same isle, preached him and <mark4>Christ;</mark4><br>
And (as I gathered from a <mark3>bystander)</mark3><br>
Their doctrine could be held by no sane <mark1>man.</mark1><br>
