Title : Exile <br>
Author : George Elliott Clarke <br><br>

for Kwame <mark4>Dawes</mark4><br>
Your scuttled pays floats--fiery--in the <mark4>ether;</mark4><br>
Blazing, it vomits smudge-smoke. Your mind chars<br>
Black because you yaw--moth-like--too near <mark4>flames.</mark4><br>
You douse your dream-scorched brain with slave-sweat rum--<br>
The only gold you can own, corroding<br>
Your <mark4>liver</mark4>, Your anthem plays to <mark4>gunfire.</mark4><br>
    When you think about it (when you can breathe)--<br>
After all the lies that frame nostalgia,<br>
All the dead faces that occupy photographs,<br>
All the slain lovers pitched into <mark4>ditches,</mark4><br>
Your eyes itch and ache with water, then dry--<br>
Curling like dead leaves, starving for gold <mark4>fire.</mark4><br>
