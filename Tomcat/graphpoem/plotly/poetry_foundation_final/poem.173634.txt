MATTHEW xiii<br>
I know the ways of learning; both the <mark4>head</mark4><br>
And pipes that feed the press, and make it <mark3>run;</mark3><br>
What reason hath from nature <mark4>borrowed,</mark4><br>
Or of itself, like a good huswife, <mark3>spun</mark3><br>
In laws and policy; what the stars <mark3>conspire,</mark3><br>
What willing nature speaks, what forc'd by <mark3>fire;</mark3><br>
Both th'old discoveries and the new-found <mark3>seas,</mark3><br>
The stock and surplus, cause and <mark4>history;</mark4><br>
All these stand open, or I have the <mark3>keys:</mark3><br>
Yet I love <mark3>thee.</mark3><br>
<br>
I know the ways of honour; what <mark4>maintains</mark4><br>
The quick returns of courtesy and <mark3>wit;</mark3><br>
In vies of favours whether party <mark3>gains</mark3><br>
When glory swells the heart and moldeth <mark3>it</mark3><br>
To all expressions both of hand and <mark3>eye,</mark3><br>
Which on the world a true-love-knot may <mark3>tie,</mark3><br>
And bear the bundle wheresoe'er it <mark4>goes;</mark4><br>
How many drams of spirit there must <mark3>be</mark3><br>
To sell my life unto my friends or <mark3>foes:</mark3><br>
Yet I love <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
<br>
I know the ways of pleasure; the sweet <mark4>strains</mark4><br>
The lullings and the relishes of <mark1>it;</mark1><br>
The propositions of hot blood and <mark3>brains;</mark3><br>
What mirth and music mean; what love and <mark1>wit</mark1><br>
Have done these twenty hundred years and <mark4>more;</mark4><br>
I know the projects of unbridled <mark3>store;</mark3><br>
My stuff is flesh, not brass; my senses <mark3>live,</mark3><br>
And grumble oft that they have more in <mark3>me</mark3><br>
Than he that curbs them, being but one to <mark3>five:</mark3><br>
Yet I love <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
<br>
I know all these and have them in my <mark4>hand;</mark4><br>
Therefore not seeled but with open <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
I fly to thee, and fully <mark3>understand</mark3><br>
Both the main sale and the <mark4>commodities;</mark4><br>
And at what rate and price I have thy <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
With all the circumstances that may <mark4>move.</mark4><br>
Yet through the labyrinths, not my grovelling <mark1>wit,</mark1><br>
But thy silk twist let down from heav'n to <mark1>me</mark1><br>
Did both conduct and teach me how by <mark1>it</mark1><br>
To climb to <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
