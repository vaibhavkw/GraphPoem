Title : You Can't Buy Shoes in a Painting <br>
Author : Jill Osier <br><br>

You can't even buy a soda. You can only <br>
see these things, see a mother steer <br>
her son to the car, his head <mark4>cocked</mark4><br>
licking his ice <mark4>cream.</mark4><br>
<br>
Earlier, driving, trying to keep   <br>
between two cornfields, I couldn't see <mark4>myself</mark4><br>
into a map, couldn't be anywhere in <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
though I knew all the patient <mark4>states</mark4><br>
between <mark4>us.</mark4><br>
<br>
Pigeons sit high on a mill's peaked <mark4>roof,</mark4><br>
spaced even as beads. They can stand <mark4>that</mark4><br>
close to each other, but looking at <mark4>them</mark4><br>
you wouldn't know it. Would you.<br>
