Title : The True Born Englishman <br>
Author : Daniel Defoe <br><br>

Thus from a mixture of all kinds <mark4>began,</mark4><br>
That het'rogeneous thing, an <mark4>Englishman:</mark4><br>
In eager rapes, and furious lust <mark5>begot,</mark5><br>
Betwixt a painted Britain and a <mark4>Scot.</mark4><br>
Whose gend'ring off-spring quickly learn'd to <mark3>bow,</mark3><br>
And yoke their heifers to the Roman <mark3>plough:</mark3><br>
From whence a mongrel half-bred race there <mark3>came,</mark3><br>
With neither name, nor nation, speech nor <mark3>fame.</mark3><br>
In whose hot veins new mixtures quickly <mark4>ran,</mark4><br>
Infus'd betwixt a Saxon and a <mark4>Dane.</mark4><br>
While their rank daughters, to their parents <mark4>just,</mark4><br>
Receiv'd all nations with promiscuous <mark3>lust.</mark3><br>
This nauseous brood directly did <mark3>contain</mark3><br>
The well-extracted blood of <mark4>Englishmen.</mark4><br>
<br>
      Which medly canton'd in a heptarchy,<br>
A rhapsody of nations to <mark1>supply,</mark1><br>
Among themselves maintain'd eternal <mark4>wars,</mark4><br>
And still the ladies lov'd the <mark4>conquerors.</mark4><br>
<br>
The western Angles all the rest <mark5>subdu'd;</mark5><br>
A bloody nation, barbarous and <mark4>rude:</mark4><br>
Who by the tenure of the sword possest<br>
One part of Britain, and subdu'd the <mark4>rest</mark4><br>
And as great things denominate the <mark4>small,</mark4><br>
The conqu'ring part gave title to the <mark4>whole.</mark4><br>
The Scot, Pict, Britain, Roman, Dane, <mark4>submit,</mark4><br>
And with the English-Saxon all <mark4>unite:</mark4><br>
And these the mixture have so close pursu'd,<br>
The very name and memory's <mark1>subdu'd:</mark1><br>
No Roman now, no Britain does <mark4>remain;</mark4><br>
Wales strove to separate, but strove in <mark3>vain:</mark3><br>
The silent nations undistinguish'd <mark4>fall,</mark4><br>
And Englishman's the common name for <mark3>all.</mark3><br>
Fate jumbled them together, God knows <mark3>how;</mark3><br>
What e'er they were they're true-born English <mark3>now.</mark3><br>
<br>
The wonder which remains is at our <mark4>pride,</mark4><br>
To value that which all wise men <mark3>deride.</mark3><br>
For Englishmen to boast of <mark4>generation,</mark4><br>
Cancels their knowledge, and lampoons the <mark3>nation.</mark3><br>
A true-born Englishman's a <mark4>contradiction,</mark4><br>
In speech an irony, in fact a <mark3>fiction.</mark3><br>
A banter made to be a test of <mark4>fools,</mark4><br>
Which those that use it justly <mark4>ridicules.</mark4><br>
A metaphor invented to <mark4>express</mark4><br>
A man a-kin to all the <mark4>universe.</mark4><br>
<br>
For as the Scots, as learned men ha' <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
Throughout the world their wand'ring seed ha' <mark3>spread;</mark3><br>
So open-handed England, 'tis believ'd,<br>
Has all the gleanings of the world receiv'd.<br>
<br>
Some think of England 'twas our Saviour <mark4>meant,</mark4><br>
The Gospel should to all the world be <mark3>sent:</mark3><br>
Since, when the blessed sound did hither <mark3>reach,</mark3><br>
They to all nations might be said to <mark3>preach.</mark3><br>
<br>
      'Tis well that virtue gives nobility,<br>
How shall we else the want of birth and blood <mark1>supply?</mark1><br>
Since scarce one family is left <mark3>alive,</mark3><br>
Which does not from some foreigner <mark3>derive.</mark3><br>
