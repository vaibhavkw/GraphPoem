Title : As You Came from the Holy Land (attributed) <br>
Author : Sir Walter Ralegh <br><br>

As you came from the holy <mark1>land</mark1><br>
         Of Walsingham,<br>
Met you not with my true <mark1>love</mark1><br>
         By the way as you came?<br>
<br>
"How shall I know your true <mark1>love,</mark1><br>
That have met many <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
I went to the holy <mark1>land,</mark1><br>
That have come, that have <mark4>gone?"</mark4><br>
<br>
She is neither white, nor <mark4>brown,</mark4><br>
But as the heavens <mark3>fair;</mark3><br>
There is none hath a form so <mark4>divine</mark4><br>
In the earth, or the <mark3>air.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Such a one did I meet, good sir,<br>
Such an angelic <mark3>face,</mark3><br>
Who like a queen, like a nymph, did <mark4>appear</mark4><br>
By her gait, by her <mark3>grace."</mark3><br>
<br>
She hath left me here all <mark4>alone,</mark4><br>
All <mark3>alone</mark3>, as <mark3>unknown,</mark3><br>
Who sometimes did me lead with herself,<br>
And me loved as her <mark3>own.</mark3><br>
<br>
"What's the cause that she leaves you <mark1>alone,</mark1><br>
And a new way doth <mark3>take,</mark3><br>
Who loved you once as her <mark1>own,</mark1><br>
And her joy did you <mark3>make?"</mark3><br>
<br>
I have lov'd her all my youth;<br>
But now old, as you <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
Love likes not the falling <mark4>fruit</mark4><br>
From the withered <mark3>tree.</mark3><br>
<br>
Know that Love is a careless <mark4>child,</mark4><br>
And forgets promise <mark4>past;</mark4><br>
He is blind, he is deaf when he <mark4>list,</mark4><br>
And in faith never <mark4>fast.</mark4><br>
<br>
His desire is a dureless <mark4>content,</mark4><br>
And a trustless <mark3>joy:</mark3><br>
He is won with a world of <mark4>despair,</mark4><br>
And is lost with a <mark3>toy.</mark3><br>
<br>
Of womenkind such indeed is the <mark1>love,</mark1><br>
         Or the word love abus'd,<br>
Under which many childish <mark5>desires</mark5><br>
         And conceits are excus'd.<br>
<br>
But true love is a durable <mark4>fire,</mark4><br>
In the mind ever <mark3>burning,</mark3><br>
Never sick, never <mark4>old</mark4>, never <mark4>dead,</mark4><br>
From itself never <mark3>turning.</mark3><br>
