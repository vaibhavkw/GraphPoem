Title : Baudelaire <br>
Author : Delmore Schwartz <br><br>

When I fall <mark3>asleep</mark3>, and even during <mark3>sleep,</mark3><br>
I hear, quite distinctly, voices <mark4>speaking</mark4><br>
Whole phrases, commonplace and trivial,   <br>
Having no relation to my <mark4>affairs.</mark4><br>
<br>
Dear Mother, is any time left to <mark4>us</mark4><br>
In which to be happy? My debts are <mark4>immense.</mark4><br>
My bank account is subject to the court's <mark4>judgment.</mark4><br>
I know <mark4>nothing</mark4>, I cannot know <mark4>anything.</mark4><br>
I have lost the ability to make an <mark4>effort.</mark4><br>
But now as before my love for you <mark4>increases.</mark4><br>
You are always armed to stone me, <mark4>always:</mark4><br>
It is true. It dates from childhood. <br>
<br>
For the first time in my long <mark4>life</mark4><br>
I am almost happy. The book, almost <mark4>finished,</mark4><br>
Almost seems good. It will endure, a <mark4>monument</mark4><br>
To my obsessions, my hatred, my <mark4>disgust.</mark4><br>
<br>
Debts and inquietude persist and weaken <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
Satan glides before me, saying <mark4>sweetly:</mark4><br>
"Rest for a day! You can rest and play today.   <br>
Tonight you will work." When night <mark4>comes,</mark4><br>
My mind, terrified by the <mark4>arrears,</mark4><br>
Bored by <mark4>sadness</mark4>, paralyzed by <mark4>impotence,</mark4><br>
Promises: "Tomorrow: I will tomorrow." <br>
Tomorrow the same comedy enacts <mark4>itself</mark4><br>
With the same resolution, the same <mark4>weakness.</mark4><br>
<br>
I am sick of this life of furnished <mark4>rooms.</mark4><br>
I am sick of having colds and <mark4>headaches:</mark4><br>
You know my strange life. Every day <mark4>brings</mark4><br>
Its quota of wrath. You little know <br>
A poet's life, dear Mother: I must write <mark4>poems,</mark4><br>
The most fatiguing of <mark4>occupations.</mark4><br>
<br>
I am sad this morning. Do not reproach <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
I write from a cafe near the post <mark4>office,</mark4><br>
Amid the click of billiard <mark4>balls</mark4>, the clatter of <mark4>dishes,</mark4><br>
The pounding of my <mark4>heart</mark4>, I have been asked to <mark4>write</mark4><br>
"A History of Caricature." I have been asked to <mark1>write</mark1><br>
"A History of Sculpture." Shall I write a <mark4>history</mark4><br>
Of the caricatures of the sculptures of you in my <mark4>heart?</mark4><br>
<br>
Although it costs you countless <mark4>agony,</mark4><br>
Although you cannot believe it <mark4>necessary,</mark4><br>
And doubt that the sum is <mark4>accurate,</mark4><br>
Please send me money enough for at least three <mark4>weeks.</mark4><br>
