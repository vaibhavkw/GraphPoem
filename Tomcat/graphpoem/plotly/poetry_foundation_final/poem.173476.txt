Title : The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock <br>
Author : T. S. Eliot <br><br>

S'io credesse che mia risposta fosse A persona che mai tornasse al mondo, Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse. Ma percioche giammai di questo fondo Non torno vivo alcun, s'i'odo il vero, Senza tema d'infamia ti rispondo.<br>
Let us go then, you and <mark3>I,</mark3><br>
When the evening is spread out against the <mark3>sky</mark3><br>
Like a patient etherized upon a <mark4>table;</mark4><br>
Let us go, through certain half-deserted <mark3>streets,</mark3><br>
The muttering <mark3>retreats</mark3><br>
Of restless nights in one-night cheap <mark3>hotels</mark3><br>
And sawdust restaurants with <mark3>oyster-shells:</mark3><br>
Streets that follow like a tedious <mark4>argument</mark4><br>
Of insidious <mark4>intent</mark4><br>
To lead you to an overwhelming question <mark4>...</mark4><br>
Oh, do not ask, "What is <mark4>it?"</mark4><br>
Let us go and make our <mark3>visit.</mark3><br>
<br>
In the room the women come and <mark1>go</mark1><br>
Talking of <mark1>Michelangelo.</mark1><br>
<br>
The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the <mark4>window-panes,</mark4><br>
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the <mark1>window-panes,</mark1><br>
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening, <br>
Lingered upon the pools that stand in <mark4>drains,</mark4><br>
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from <mark4>chimneys,</mark4><br>
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden <mark3>leap,</mark3><br>
And seeing that it was a soft October <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
Curled once about the house, and fell <mark3>asleep.</mark3><br>
<br>
And indeed there will be <mark1>time</mark1><br>
For the yellow smoke that slides along the <mark4>street,</mark4><br>
Rubbing its back upon the <mark1>window-panes;</mark1><br>
There will be <mark1>time</mark1>, there will be <mark1>time</mark1><br>
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you <mark3>meet;</mark3><br>
There will be time to murder and <mark4>create,</mark4><br>
And time for all the works and days of <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
That lift and drop a question on your <mark3>plate;</mark3><br>
Time for you and time for <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
And time yet for a hundred indecisions, <br>
And for a hundred visions and <mark4>revisions,</mark4><br>
Before the taking of a toast and <mark3>tea.</mark3><br>
<br>
In the room the women come and <mark1>go</mark1><br>
Talking of <mark1>Michelangelo.</mark1><br>
<br>
And indeed there will be <mark1>time</mark1><br>
To wonder, "Do I dare?" and, "Do I <mark3>dare?"</mark3><br>
Time to turn back and descend the <mark3>stair,</mark3><br>
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair <mark3>--</mark3><br>
(They will say: "How his hair is growing <mark4>thin!")</mark4><br>
My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the <mark3>chin,</mark3><br>
My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin <mark3>--</mark3><br>
(They will say: "But how his arms and legs are <mark1>thin!")</mark1><br>
Do I <mark1>dare</mark1><br>
Disturb the <mark4>universe?</mark4><br>
In a minute there is <mark1>time</mark1><br>
For decisions and revisions which a minute will <mark4>reverse.</mark4><br>
<br>
For I have known them all already, known them <mark4>all:</mark4><br>
Have known the evenings, <mark4>mornings</mark4>, <mark4>afternoons,</mark4><br>
I have measured out my life with coffee <mark3>spoons;</mark3><br>
I know the voices dying with a dying <mark3>fall</mark3><br>
Beneath the music from a farther <mark4>room.</mark4><br>
So how should I <mark3>presume?</mark3><br>
<br>
And I have known the eyes already, known them <mark1>all--</mark1><br>
The eyes that fix you in a formulated <mark4>phrase,</mark4><br>
And when I am formulated, sprawling on a <mark1>pin,</mark1><br>
When I am pinned and wriggling on the <mark3>wall,</mark3><br>
Then how should I <mark3>begin</mark3><br>
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and <mark3>ways?</mark3><br>
And how should I <mark1>presume?</mark1><br>
<br>
And I have known the arms already, known them <mark1>all--</mark1><br>
Arms that are braceleted and white and <mark3>bare</mark3><br>
(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown <mark1>hair!)</mark1><br>
Is it perfume from a <mark4>dress</mark4><br>
That makes me so <mark3>digress?</mark3><br>
Arms that lie along a <mark4>table</mark4>, or wrap about a <mark3>shawl.</mark3><br>
And should I then <mark1>presume?</mark1><br>
And how should I <mark1>begin?</mark1><br>
<br>
Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow <mark1>streets</mark1><br>
And watched the smoke that rises from the <mark4>pipes</mark4><br>
Of lonely men in <mark4>shirt-sleeves</mark4>, leaning out of windows? <mark4>...</mark4><br>
<br>
I should have been a pair of ragged <mark4>claws</mark4><br>
Scuttling across the floors of silent <mark4>seas.</mark4><br>
<br>
And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so <mark4>peacefully!</mark4><br>
Smoothed by long <mark4>fingers,</mark4><br>
Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers, <br>
Stretched on the floor, here beside you and <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
Should I, after tea and cakes and <mark4>ices,</mark4><br>
Have the strength to force the moment to its <mark4>crisis?</mark4><br>
But though I have wept and <mark4>fasted</mark4>, wept and <mark4>prayed,</mark4><br>
Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a <mark5>platter,</mark5><br>
I am no prophet -- and here's no great <mark3>matter;</mark3><br>
I have seen the moment of my greatness <mark4>flicker,</mark4><br>
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and <mark3>snicker,</mark3><br>
And in short, I was <mark3>afraid.</mark3><br>
<br>
And would it have been worth it, after <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
After the cups, the marmalade, the <mark1>tea,</mark1><br>
Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Would it have been worth <mark4>while,</mark4><br>
To have bitten off the matter with a <mark3>smile,</mark3><br>
To have squeezed the universe into a <mark4>ball</mark4><br>
To roll it towards some overwhelming <mark1>question,</mark1><br>
To say: "I am Lazarus, come from the <mark4>dead,</mark4><br>
Come back to tell you <mark1>all</mark1>, I shall tell you <mark1>all"--</mark1><br>
If one, settling a pillow by her <mark3>head</mark3><br>
Should say: "That is not what I meant at <mark1>all;</mark1><br>
That is not it, at <mark1>all."</mark1><br>
<br>
And would it have been worth it, after <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
Would it have been worth <mark1>while,</mark1><br>
After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled <mark1>streets,</mark1><br>
After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the <mark4>floor--</mark4><br>
And this, and so much <mark3>more?--</mark3><br>
It is impossible to say just what I <mark4>mean!</mark4><br>
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a <mark3>screen:</mark3><br>
Would it have been worth <mark1>while</mark1><br>
If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a <mark1>shawl,</mark1><br>
And turning toward the window, should say: <br>
"That is not it at <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
That is not what I meant, at <mark1>all."</mark1><br>
<br>
No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to <mark3>be;</mark3><br>
Am an attendant lord, one that will <mark3>do</mark3><br>
To swell a progress, start a scene or <mark3>two,</mark3><br>
Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy <mark4>tool,</mark4><br>
Deferential, glad to be of <mark4>use,</mark4><br>
Politic, <mark4>cautious</mark4>, and <mark4>meticulous;</mark4><br>
Full of high <mark4>sentence</mark4>, but a bit <mark4>obtuse;</mark4><br>
At times, indeed, almost <mark4>ridiculous--</mark4><br>
Almost, at times, the <mark3>Fool.</mark3><br>
<br>
I grow old ... I grow old <mark4>...</mark4><br>
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers <mark3>rolled.</mark3><br>
<br>
Shall I part my hair behind?   Do I dare to eat a <mark5>peach?</mark5><br>
I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the <mark3>beach.</mark3><br>
I have heard the mermaids singing, each to <mark3>each.</mark3><br>
<br>
I do not think that they will sing to <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
<br>
I have seen them riding seaward on the <mark4>waves</mark4><br>
Combing the white hair of the waves blown <mark3>back</mark3><br>
When the wind blows the water white and <mark3>black.</mark3><br>
We have lingered in the chambers of the <mark3>sea</mark3><br>
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and <mark4>brown</mark4><br>
Till human voices wake us, and we <mark3>drown.</mark3><br>
