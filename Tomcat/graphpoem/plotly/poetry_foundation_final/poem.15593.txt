Title : Decline and Fall<br>
Author : John Frederick Nims<br><br>

We had a city also. Hand in <mark3>hand</mark3><br>
Wandered happy as travellers our own <mark3>land.</mark3><br>
Murmured in turn the hearsay of each <mark3>stone</mark3><br>
Or, where a legend faltered, lived our <mark3>own.</mark3><br>
The far-seen obelisk my father <mark3>set</mark3><br>
(Pinning two roads forever where they <mark3>met)</mark3><br>
Waved us in wandering circles, turned our <mark4>tread</mark4><br>
Where once morass engulfed that passionate <mark3>head.</mark3><br>
<br>
Cornice rose in ranges, rose so <mark3>high</mark3><br>
It saw no sky, that forum, but noon <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
Marble shone like shallows; columns <mark3>too</mark3><br>
Streamed with cool light as rocks in breakers <mark3>do.</mark3><br>
<br>
O marble many-colored as reach of <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
Tones so recollected and so <mark3>distraught.</mark3><br>
Golden: like swimmers when the August <mark3>shore</mark3><br>
Brightens their folklore poses more and <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
Or grey with silver: moon's whirling <mark3>spell</mark3><br>
Over the breathless olives we knew <mark3>well;</mark3><br>
Ivory as shoulders there that <mark4>summer-dressed</mark4><br>
Curve to come shyly naked, then find <mark3>rest</mark3><br>
(The tresses love dishevelled leaning <mark4>dazed</mark4><br>
And grateful). Or the wayward stone that <mark3>blazed</mark3><br>
As cheeks do. Or as eyes half-lowered <mark4>flare.</mark4><br>
Violet as veins <mark4>are</mark4>, love knows <mark3>where.</mark3><br>
Fine coral as the shy and wild tonguetip,   <br>
Undersea coral, rich as inner lip. <br>
<br>
There was a stone to build <mark4>on!</mark4><br>
Friezes <mark4>ran</mark4><br>
In strong chorales that where they closed <mark3>began;</mark3><br>
And statues: each a wrung or ringing <mark3>phrase</mark3><br>
In the soul's passionate cadence of her <mark3>days.</mark3><br>
<br>
O stone so matched and massive, worked so <mark1>well,</mark1><br>
Who could believe it when the first brick <mark3>fell?</mark3><br>
Who could imagine the unlucky <mark4>word</mark4><br>
Would darken to the worldwide sigh we <mark3>heard?</mark3><br>
How our eyes wrenched together and held <mark4>fast</mark4><br>
Each face tightening to a chalky <mark3>cast</mark3><br>
(So poor a copy of one hour <mark4>before).</mark4><br>
Who could believe the gloom, the funnelled <mark3>roar</mark3><br>
Of cornice falling, forum falling, <mark4>all</mark4><br>
Falling? Or dream it fallen? Not a <mark3>wall</mark3><br>
With eaves to route the rain. The rivers <mark4>swelled</mark4><br>
Till roads groped in lakebottom. Nothing <mark3>held</mark3><br>
Clean edge or corner. Caking, the black <mark4>flood</mark4><br>
Left every luminous room tunnels of <mark3>mud.</mark3><br>
Earth shook: the columns <mark4>walked</mark4>, in midair <mark4>clashed,</mark4><br>
And the steep stone exploded as it <mark3>crashed.</mark3><br>
<br>
Soon the barbarian swarmed like locusts <mark4>blown</mark4><br>
Between the flood and spasm of our <mark1>stone.</mark1><br>
Grunted to tug their huts and marble sties   <br>
Where friezes broke like foam in the blue <mark4>skies.</mark4><br>
Blue noses poked, recoiling as they <mark4>found</mark4><br>
Our young and glad-eyed statues <mark4>underground;</mark4><br>
Singing salvation, the lewd chisel pecks   <br>
At boy and girl: one mutilated sex. <br>
<br>
All our high moments cheapened--greed and grime   <br>
Charred them in rickety stithies to quicklime. <br>
<br>
Murderous world. That town that seemed a <mark4>star</mark4><br>
Rose in our soul. And there the ruins <mark3>are.</mark3><br>
We'll not walk there again. Who'd wish to <mark5>walk</mark5><br>
Where the rats gather and grey tourists <mark3>talk?</mark3><br>
Who'd walk there even alive? Or bid his <mark4>ghost</mark4><br>
Trail phosphor on the melancholy <mark3>coast?</mark3><br>
