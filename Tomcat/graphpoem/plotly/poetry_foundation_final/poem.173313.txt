Title : A Hymn to the Name and Honour of the Admirable Saint Teresa <br>
Author : Richard Crashaw <br><br>

Love, thou are absolute sole <mark4>lord</mark4><br>
Of life and death. To prove the <mark4>word,</mark4><br>
We'll now appeal to none of <mark3>all</mark3><br>
Those thy old soldiers, great and <mark3>tall,</mark3><br>
Ripe men of martyrdom, that could reach <mark3>down</mark3><br>
With strong arms their triumphant <mark3>crown;</mark3><br>
Such as could with lusty <mark3>breath</mark3><br>
Speak loud into the face of <mark3>death</mark3><br>
Their great Lord's glorious name; to <mark4>none</mark4><br>
Of those whose spacious bosoms spread a <mark4>throne</mark4><br>
For love at large to fill; spare blood and <mark4>sweat,</mark4><br>
And see him take a private <mark4>seat,</mark4><br>
Making his mansion in the <mark4>mild</mark4><br>
And milky soul of a soft <mark3>child.</mark3><br>
<br>
Scarce has she learn'd to lisp the <mark3>name</mark3><br>
Of martyr, yet she thinks it <mark3>shame</mark3><br>
Life should so long play with that <mark1>breath</mark1><br>
Which spent can buy so brave a <mark1>death.</mark1><br>
She never undertook to <mark2>know</mark2><br>
What death with love should have to <mark3>do;</mark3><br>
Nor has she e'er yet <mark4>understood</mark4><br>
Why to show love she should shed <mark4>blood;</mark4><br>
Yet though she cannot tell you <mark3>why,</mark3><br>
She can love, and she can <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
<br>
Scarce has she blood enough to <mark3>make</mark3><br>
A guilty sword blush for her <mark3>sake;</mark3><br>
Yet has she'a heart dares hope to <mark4>prove</mark4><br>
How much less strong is death than <mark4>love.</mark4><br>
<br>
Be love but there, let poor six <mark3>years</mark3><br>
Be pos'd with the maturest <mark3>fears</mark3><br>
Man trembles at, you straight shall <mark4>find</mark4><br>
Love knows no nonage, nor the <mark3>mind.</mark3><br>
'Tis love, not years or limbs that <mark4>can</mark4><br>
Make the martyr, or the <mark3>man.</mark3><br>
<br>
Love touch'd her heart, and lo it <mark3>beats</mark3><br>
High, and burns with such brave <mark3>heats,</mark3><br>
Such thirsts to die, as dares drink <mark3>up</mark3><br>
A thousand cold deaths in one <mark3>cup.</mark3><br>
Good reason, for she breathes all <mark3>fire;</mark3><br>
Her weak breast heaves with strong <mark3>desire</mark3><br>
Of what she may with fruitless <mark4>wishes</mark4><br>
Seek for amongst her mother's <mark4>kisses.</mark4><br>
<br>
Since 'tis not to be had at <mark4>home,</mark4><br>
She'll travel to a <mark4>martyrdom.</mark4><br>
No home for hers confesses <mark3>she</mark3><br>
But where she may a martyr <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
<br>
She'll to the Moors, and trade with <mark4>them</mark4><br>
For this unvalued <mark4>diadem.</mark4><br>
She'll offer them her dearest <mark1>breath,</mark1><br>
With Christ's name in 't, in change for <mark1>death.</mark1><br>
She'll bargain with them, and will <mark4>give</mark4><br>
Them God; teach them how to <mark3>live</mark3><br>
In him; or, if they this <mark3>deny,</mark3><br>
For him she'll teach them how to <mark1>die.</mark1><br>
So shall she leave amongst them <mark4>sown</mark4><br>
Her Lord's blood, or at least her <mark3>own.</mark3><br>
<br>
Farewell then, all the world, <mark3>adieu!</mark3><br>
Teresa is no more for <mark3>you.</mark3><br>
Farewell, all pleasures, sports, and <mark4>joys,</mark4><br>
(Never till now esteemed <mark3>toys)</mark3><br>
Farewell, whatever dear may <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
Mother's arms or father's <mark3>knee,</mark3><br>
Farewell house and farewell <mark1>home,</mark1><br>
She's for the Moors, and <mark1>martyrdom!</mark1><br>
<br>
Sweet, not so fast! lo, thy fair <mark4>spouse,</mark4><br>
Whom thou seek'st with so swift <mark4>vows,</mark4><br>
Calls thee back, and bids thee <mark4>come</mark4><br>
T' embrace a milder <mark1>martyrdom.</mark1><br>
<br>
Blest powers forbid thy tender <mark3>life</mark3><br>
Should bleed upon a barbarous <mark3>knife;</mark3><br>
Or some base hand have power to <mark4>rase</mark4><br>
Thy breast's chaste cabinet, and uncase<br>
A soul kept there so sweet; oh <mark2>no,</mark2><br>
Wise Heav'n will never have it <mark3>so;</mark3><br>
Thou art Love's victim, and must <mark1>die</mark1><br>
A death more mystical and <mark3>high;</mark3><br>
Into Love's arms thou shalt let <mark3>fall</mark3><br>
A still-surviving <mark4>funeral.</mark4><br>
He is the dart must make the <mark1>death</mark1><br>
Whose stroke shall taste thy hallow'd <mark1>breath;</mark1><br>
A dart thrice dipp'd in that rich <mark4>flame</mark4><br>
Which writes thy spouse's radiant <mark1>name</mark1><br>
Upon the roof of heav'n, where <mark3>aye</mark3><br>
It shines, and with a sovereign ray<br>
Beats bright upon the burning <mark4>faces</mark4><br>
Of <mark4>souls</mark4>, which in that name's sweet <mark3>graces</mark3><br>
Find everlasting smiles. So <mark4>rare,</mark4><br>
So spiritual, <mark4>pure</mark4>, and <mark3>fair</mark3><br>
Must be th' immortal <mark4>instrument</mark4><br>
Upon whose choice point shall be <mark4>sent</mark4><br>
A life so lov'd; and that there <mark1>be</mark1><br>
Fit executioners for <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
The fair'st and first-born sons of <mark1>fire,</mark1><br>
Blest Seraphim, shall leave their <mark3>quire</mark3><br>
And turn Love's soldiers, upon <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
To exercise their <mark4>archery.</mark4><br>
<br>
Oh, how oft shalt thou <mark4>complain</mark4><br>
Of a sweet and subtle <mark3>pain,</mark3><br>
Of intolerable <mark1>joys,</mark1><br>
Of a death in which who <mark4>dies</mark4><br>
Loves his death, and dies <mark3>again,</mark3><br>
And would forever so be <mark3>slain,</mark3><br>
And lives and dies, and knows not <mark1>why</mark1><br>
To live, but that he thus may never leave to <mark1>die.</mark1><br>
<br>
How kindly will thy gentle <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
Kiss the sweetly-killing <mark3>dart!</mark3><br>
And close in his embraces <mark4>keep</mark4><br>
Those delicious wounds, that <mark3>weep</mark3><br>
Balsam to heal themselves with. <mark4>Thus</mark4><br>
When these thy <mark4>deaths</mark4>, so <mark4>numerous,</mark4><br>
Shall all at last die into <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
And melt thy soul's sweet <mark4>mansion</mark4><br>
Like a soft lump of incense, hasted<br>
By too hot a fire, and <mark4>wasted</mark4><br>
Into perfuming clouds, so <mark4>fast</mark4><br>
Shalt thou exhale to Heav'n at <mark3>last</mark3><br>
In a resolving sigh; and <mark4>then,</mark4><br>
O what? Ask not the tongues of <mark3>men;</mark3><br>
Angels cannot tell; <mark4>suffice,</mark4><br>
Thyself shall feel thine own full <mark1>joys</mark1><br>
And hold them fast forever. <mark4>There</mark4><br>
So soon as thou shalt first <mark4>appear,</mark4><br>
The moon of maiden stars, thy <mark4>white</mark4><br>
Mistress, attended by such <mark3>bright</mark3><br>
Souls as thy shining self, shall <mark1>come</mark1><br>
And in her first ranks make thee <mark4>room;</mark4><br>
Where 'mongst her snowy <mark4>family</mark4><br>
Immortal welcomes wait for <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
<br>
O what delight, when reveal'd Life shall <mark4>stand</mark4><br>
And teach thy lips heav'n with his <mark3>hand,</mark3><br>
On which thou now mayst to thy <mark1>wishes</mark1><br>
Heap up thy consecrated <mark1>kisses.</mark1><br>
What joys shall seize thy soul when <mark1>she,</mark1><br>
Bending her blessed eyes on <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
(Those second smiles of heav'n) shall <mark1>dart</mark1><br>
Her mild rays through thy melting <mark1>heart!</mark1><br>
<br>
Angels, thy old friends, there shall greet <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
Glad at their own home now to meet <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
<br>
All thy good works which went <mark4>before</mark4><br>
And waited for thee, at the <mark3>door,</mark3><br>
Shall own thee there, and all in <mark1>one</mark1><br>
Weave a <mark4>constellation</mark4><br>
Of crowns, with which the King, thy <mark1>spouse,</mark1><br>
Shall build up thy triumphant <mark4>brows.</mark4><br>
<br>
All thy old woes shall now smile on <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
And thy pains sit bright upon <mark1>thee;</mark1><br>
All thy sorrows here shall <mark4>shine,</mark4><br>
All thy suff'rings be <mark3>divine;</mark3><br>
Tears shall take comfort and turn <mark4>gems,</mark4><br>
And wrongs repent to <mark5>diadems.</mark5><br>
Ev'n thy deaths shall live, and <mark3>new</mark3><br>
Dress the soul that erst they <mark3>slew;</mark3><br>
Thy wounds shall blush to such bright <mark4>scars</mark4><br>
As keep account of the Lamb's <mark4>wars.</mark4><br>
<br>
Those rare works where thou shalt leave <mark4>writ</mark4><br>
Love's noble history, with <mark3>wit</mark3><br>
Taught thee by none but him, while <mark4>here</mark4><br>
They feed our souls, shall clothe thine <mark1>there.</mark1><br>
Each heav'nly word by whose hid <mark1>flame</mark1><br>
Our hard hearts shall strike fire, the <mark3>same</mark3><br>
Shall flourish on thy brows, and <mark1>be</mark1><br>
Both fire to us and flame to <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
Whose light shall live bright in thy <mark4>face</mark4><br>
By glory, in our hearts by <mark3>grace.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thou shalt look round about and <mark3>see</mark3><br>
Thousands of crown'd souls throng to <mark1>be</mark1><br>
Themselves thy crown; sons of thy <mark1>vows,</mark1><br>
The virgin-births with which thy sovereign <mark1>spouse</mark1><br>
Made fruitful thy fair soul, go <mark3>now</mark3><br>
And with them all about thee, <mark3>bow</mark3><br>
To him. "Put on," he'll say, "put <mark4>on,</mark4><br>
My rosy love, that thy rich <mark4>zone</mark4><br>
Sparkling with the sacred <mark4>flames</mark4><br>
Of thousand souls whose happy <mark3>names</mark3><br>
Heav'n keeps upon thy score. Thy <mark1>bright</mark1><br>
Life brought them first to kiss the <mark3>light</mark3><br>
That kindled them to stars." And <mark1>so</mark1><br>
Thou with the Lamb, thy Lord, shalt <mark3>go,</mark3><br>
And wheresoe'er he sets his <mark1>white</mark1><br>
Steps, walk with him those ways of <mark1>light</mark1><br>
Which who in death would live to <mark1>see</mark1><br>
Must learn in life to die like <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
