Title : Huge Vapours Brood above the Clifted Shore <br>
Author : Charlotte Smith <br><br>

Huge vapours brood above the clifted <mark3>shore,</mark3><br>
Night o'er the ocean settles, dark and <mark4>mute,</mark4><br>
Save where is heard the repercussive <mark3>roar</mark3><br>
Of drowsy billows, on the rugged <mark4>foot</mark4><br>
Of rocks remote; or still more distant <mark3>tone</mark3><br>
Of seamen, in the anchored bark, that <mark3>tell</mark3><br>
The watch relieved; or one deep voice <mark3>alone,</mark3><br>
Singing the hour, and bidding "strike the <mark3>bell."</mark3><br>
All is black shadow, but the lucid <mark4>line</mark4><br>
Marked by the light surf on the level <mark3>sand,</mark3><br>
Or where afar, the ship-lights faintly <mark3>shine</mark3><br>
Like wandering fairy fires, that oft on <mark3>land</mark3><br>
Mislead the pilgrim; such the dubious <mark3>ray</mark3><br>
That wavering reason lends, in life's long darkling <mark3>way.</mark3><br>
