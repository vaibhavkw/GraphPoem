Title : Love Song <br>
Author : Dorothy Parker <br><br>

My own dear love, he is strong and <mark3>bold</mark3><br>
And he cares not what comes <mark3>after.</mark3><br>
His words ring sweet as a chime of <mark3>gold,</mark3><br>
And his eyes are lit with <mark3>laughter.</mark3><br>
He is jubilant as a flag <mark4>unfurled--</mark4><br>
Oh, a girl, she'd not forget <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
My own dear love, he is all my <mark3>world,--</mark3><br>
And I wish I'd never met <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
<br>
My love, he's mad, and my love, he's <mark3>fleet,</mark3><br>
And a wild young wood-thing bore <mark1>him!</mark1><br>
The ways are fair to his roaming <mark3>feet,</mark3><br>
And the skies are sunlit for <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
As sharply sweet to my heart he <mark3>seems</mark3><br>
As the fragrance of <mark4>acacia.</mark4><br>
My own dear love, he is all my <mark3>dreams,--</mark3><br>
And I wish he were in <mark4>Asia.</mark4><br>
<br>
My love runs by like a day in June, <br>
And he makes no friends of <mark4>sorrows.</mark4><br>
He'll tread his galloping rigadoon <br>
      In the pathway of the morrows. <br>
He'll live his days where the sunbeams <mark4>start,</mark4><br>
Nor could storm or wind uproot <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
My own dear love, he is all my <mark3>heart,--</mark3><br>
And I wish somebody'd shoot <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
