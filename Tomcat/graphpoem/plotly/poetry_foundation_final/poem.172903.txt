Title : The New Decalogue <br>
Author : Ambrose Bierce <br><br>

Have but one God: thy knees were <mark3>sore</mark3><br>
If bent in prayer to three or <mark3>four.</mark3><br>
<br>
Adore no images save <mark3>those</mark3><br>
The coinage of thy country <mark3>shows.</mark3><br>
<br>
Take not the Name in vain. <mark3>Direct</mark3><br>
Thy swearing unto some <mark3>effect.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thy hand from Sunday work be <mark3>held--</mark3><br>
Work not at all unless <mark3>compelled.</mark3><br>
<br>
Honor thy <mark4>parents</mark4>, and <mark4>perchance</mark4><br>
Their wills thy fortunes may <mark3>advance.</mark3><br>
<br>
Kill not--death liberates thy <mark3>foe</mark3><br>
From persecution's constant <mark3>woe.</mark3><br>
<br>
Kiss not thy neighbor's wife. Of <mark4>course</mark4><br>
There's no objection to <mark3>divorce.</mark3><br>
<br>
To steal were folly, for 'tis <mark3>plain</mark3><br>
In cheating there is greater <mark3>gain.</mark3><br>
<br>
Bear not false witness. Shake your <mark4>head</mark4><br>
And say that you have "heard it <mark3>said."</mark3><br>
<br>
Who stays to covet ne'er will <mark3>catch</mark3><br>
An opportunity to <mark3>snatch.</mark3><br>
