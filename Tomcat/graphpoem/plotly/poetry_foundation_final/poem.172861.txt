Title : Stanzas from the Grande Chartreuse <br>
Author : Matthew Arnold <br><br>

Through Alpine meadows <mark4>soft-suffused</mark4><br>
With rain, where thick the crocus <mark3>blows,</mark3><br>
Past the dark forges long <mark5>disused,</mark5><br>
The mule-track from Saint Laurent <mark3>goes.</mark3><br>
The bridge is cross'd, and slow we <mark4>ride,</mark4><br>
Through forest, up the <mark4>mountain-side.</mark4><br>
<br>
The autumnal evening darkens <mark4>round,</mark4><br>
The wind is up, and drives the <mark3>rain;</mark3><br>
While, hark! far down, with strangled <mark3>sound</mark3><br>
Doth the Dead Guier's stream <mark3>complain,</mark3><br>
Where that wet smoke, among the <mark4>woods,</mark4><br>
Over his boiling cauldron <mark5>broods.</mark5><br>
<br>
Swift rush the spectral vapours <mark3>white</mark3><br>
Past limestone scars with ragged <mark4>pines,</mark4><br>
Showing--then blotting from our <mark3>sight!--</mark3><br>
Halt--through the cloud-drift something <mark3>shines!</mark3><br>
High in the valley, wet and <mark5>drear,</mark5><br>
The huts of Courrerie <mark4>appear.</mark4><br>
<br>
Strike leftward! cries our guide; and <mark3>higher</mark3><br>
Mounts up the stony <mark3>forest-way.</mark3><br>
At last the encircling trees <mark3>retire;</mark3><br>
Look! through the showery twilight <mark3>grey</mark3><br>
What pointed roofs are these <mark3>advance?--</mark3><br>
A palace of the Kings of <mark3>France?</mark3><br>
<br>
Approach, for what we seek is <mark4>here!</mark4><br>
Alight, and sparely sup, and <mark4>wait</mark4><br>
For rest in this outbuilding <mark4>near;</mark4><br>
Then cross the sward and reach that <mark3>gate.</mark3><br>
Knock; pass the wicket! Thou art <mark5>come</mark5><br>
To the Carthusians' world-famed <mark4>home.</mark4><br>
<br>
The silent courts, where night and <mark3>day</mark3><br>
Into their stone-carved basins <mark4>cold</mark4><br>
The splashing icy fountains <mark3>play--</mark3><br>
The humid corridors <mark3>behold!</mark3><br>
Where, ghostlike in the deepening <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
Cowl'd forms brush by in gleaming <mark1>white.</mark1><br>
<br>
The <mark4>chapel</mark4>, where no organ's <mark4>peal</mark4><br>
Invests the stern and naked <mark4>prayer--</mark4><br>
With penitential cries they <mark3>kneel</mark3><br>
And wrestle; rising then, with <mark3>bare</mark3><br>
And white uplifted faces <mark4>stand,</mark4><br>
Passing the Host from hand to <mark3>hand;</mark3><br>
<br>
Each takes, and then his visage <mark4>wan</mark4><br>
Is buried in his cowl once <mark4>more.</mark4><br>
The cells!--the suffering Son of <mark4>Man</mark4><br>
Upon the wall--the knee-worn <mark3>floor--</mark3><br>
And where they sleep, that wooden <mark4>bed,</mark4><br>
Which shall their coffin be, when <mark3>dead!</mark3><br>
<br>
The library, where tract and <mark3>tome</mark3><br>
Not to feed priestly pride are <mark4>there,</mark4><br>
To hymn the conquering march of <mark3>Rome,</mark3><br>
Nor yet to amuse, as ours <mark4>are!</mark4><br>
They paint of souls the inner <mark3>strife,</mark3><br>
Their drops of blood, their death in <mark3>life.</mark3><br>
<br>
The garden, overgrown--yet <mark4>mild,</mark4><br>
See, fragrant herbs are flowering <mark1>there!</mark1><br>
Strong children of the Alpine <mark3>wild</mark3><br>
Whose culture is the brethren's <mark3>care;</mark3><br>
Of human tasks their only <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
And cheerful works beneath the <mark3>sun.</mark3><br>
<br>
Those halls, too, destined to <mark4>contain</mark4><br>
Each its own pilgrim-host of <mark4>old,</mark4><br>
From England, Germany, or <mark3>Spain--</mark3><br>
All are before me! I <mark1>behold</mark1><br>
The House, the Brotherhood <mark4>austere!</mark4><br>
--And what am I, that I am <mark1>here?</mark1><br>
<br>
For rigorous teachers seized my <mark3>youth,</mark3><br>
And purged its faith, and trimm'd its <mark4>fire,</mark4><br>
Show'd me the high, white star of <mark3>Truth,</mark3><br>
There bade me gaze, and there <mark3>aspire.</mark3><br>
Even now their whispers pierce the <mark4>gloom:</mark4><br>
What dost thou in this living <mark3>tomb?</mark3><br>
<br>
Forgive me, masters of the <mark4>mind!</mark4><br>
At whose behest I long <mark3>ago</mark3><br>
So much unlearnt, so much <mark3>resign'd--</mark3><br>
I come not here to be your <mark3>foe!</mark3><br>
I seek these anchorites, not in <mark3>ruth,</mark3><br>
To curse and to deny your <mark1>truth;</mark1><br>
<br>
Not as their friend, or child, I <mark3>speak!</mark3><br>
But as, on some far northern <mark4>strand,</mark4><br>
Thinking of his own Gods, a <mark3>Greek</mark3><br>
In pity and mournful awe might <mark1>stand</mark1><br>
Before some fallen Runic <mark4>stone--</mark4><br>
For both were faiths, and both are <mark4>gone.</mark4><br>
<br>
Wandering between two worlds, one <mark1>dead,</mark1><br>
The other powerless to be <mark4>born,</mark4><br>
With nowhere yet to rest my <mark3>head,</mark3><br>
Like these, on earth I wait <mark3>forlorn.</mark3><br>
Their faith, my tears, the world <mark4>deride--</mark4><br>
I come to shed them at their <mark3>side.</mark3><br>
<br>
Oh, hide me in your gloom <mark4>profound,</mark4><br>
Ye solemn seats of holy <mark4>pain!</mark4><br>
Take me, cowl'd forms, and fence me <mark1>round,</mark1><br>
Till I possess my soul <mark3>again;</mark3><br>
Till free my thoughts before me <mark4>roll,</mark4><br>
Not chafed by hourly false <mark3>control!</mark3><br>
<br>
For the world cries your faith is <mark3>now</mark3><br>
But a dead time's exploded <mark4>dream;</mark4><br>
My melancholy, sciolists <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
Is a pass'd mode, an outworn <mark3>theme--</mark3><br>
As if the world had ever <mark4>had</mark4><br>
A faith, or sciolists been <mark3>sad!</mark3><br>
<br>
Ah, if it be pass'd, take <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
At least, the restlessness, the <mark1>pain;</mark1><br>
Be man henceforth no more a <mark3>prey</mark3><br>
To these out-dated stings <mark1>again!</mark1><br>
The nobleness of grief is <mark1>gone</mark1><br>
Ah, leave us not the fret <mark4>alone!</mark4><br>
<br>
But--if you cannot give us <mark4>ease--</mark4><br>
Last of the race of them who <mark3>grieve</mark3><br>
Here leave us to die out with <mark3>these</mark3><br>
Last of the people who <mark3>believe!</mark3><br>
Silent, while years engrave the <mark3>brow;</mark3><br>
Silent--the best are silent <mark1>now.</mark1><br>
<br>
Achilles ponders in his <mark4>tent,</mark4><br>
The kings of modern thought are <mark4>dumb,</mark4><br>
Silent they are though not <mark3>content,</mark3><br>
And wait to see the future <mark1>come.</mark1><br>
They have the grief men had of <mark4>yore,</mark4><br>
But they contend and cry no <mark1>more.</mark1><br>
<br>
Our fathers water'd with their <mark4>tears</mark4><br>
This sea of time whereon we <mark4>sail,</mark4><br>
Their voices were in all men's <mark3>ears</mark3><br>
We pass'd within their puissant <mark3>hail.</mark3><br>
Still the same ocean round us <mark4>raves,</mark4><br>
But we stand mute, and watch the <mark3>waves.</mark3><br>
<br>
For what avail'd it, all the <mark4>noise</mark4><br>
And outcry of the former <mark4>men?--</mark4><br>
Say, have their sons achieved more <mark3>joys,</mark3><br>
Say, is life lighter now than <mark3>then?</mark3><br>
The sufferers died, they left their <mark1>pain--</mark1><br>
The pangs which tortured them <mark3>remain.</mark3><br>
<br>
What helps it now, that Byron <mark3>bore,</mark3><br>
With haughty scorn which mock'd the <mark4>smart,</mark4><br>
Through Europe to the AEtolian <mark3>shore</mark3><br>
The pageant of his bleeding <mark3>heart?</mark3><br>
That thousands counted every <mark4>groan,</mark4><br>
And Europe made his woe her <mark3>own?</mark3><br>
<br>
What boots it, Shelley! that the <mark4>breeze</mark4><br>
Carried thy lovely wail <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
Musical through Italian <mark3>trees</mark3><br>
Which fringe thy soft blue Spezzian <mark3>bay?</mark3><br>
Inheritors of thy <mark4>distress</mark4><br>
Have restless hearts one throb the <mark3>less?</mark3><br>
<br>
Or are we easier, to have <mark4>read,</mark4><br>
O Obermann! the sad, stern <mark3>page,</mark3><br>
Which tells us how thou hidd'st thy <mark1>head</mark1><br>
From the fierce tempest of thine <mark3>age</mark3><br>
In the lone brakes of Fontainebleau, <br>
Or chalets near the Alpine <mark3>snow?</mark3><br>
<br>
Ye slumber in your silent <mark4>grave!--</mark4><br>
The world, which for an idle <mark1>day</mark1><br>
Grace to your mood of sadness <mark3>gave,</mark3><br>
Long since hath flung her weeds <mark1>away.</mark1><br>
The eternal trifler breaks your <mark4>spell;</mark4><br>
But we--we learned your lore too <mark3>well!</mark3><br>
<br>
Years hence, perhaps, may dawn an <mark1>age,</mark1><br>
More fortunate, alas! than we, <br>
Which without hardness will be <mark3>sage,</mark3><br>
And gay without frivolity. <br>
Sons of the world, oh, speed those <mark4>years;</mark4><br>
But, while we wait, allow our <mark1>tears!</mark1><br>
<br>
Allow them! We admire with <mark3>awe</mark3><br>
The exulting thunder of your <mark4>race;</mark4><br>
You give the universe your <mark3>law,</mark3><br>
You triumph over time and <mark3>space!</mark3><br>
Your pride of life, your tireless <mark4>powers,</mark4><br>
We laud them, but they are not <mark3>ours.</mark3><br>
<br>
We are like children rear'd in <mark4>shade</mark4><br>
Beneath some old-world abbey <mark4>wall,</mark4><br>
Forgotten in a <mark3>forest-glade,</mark3><br>
And secret from the eyes of <mark3>all.</mark3><br>
Deep, deep the greenwood round them <mark1>waves,</mark1><br>
Their abbey, and its close of <mark3>graves!</mark3><br>
<br>
But, where the road runs near the <mark4>stream,</mark4><br>
Oft through the trees they catch a <mark4>glance</mark4><br>
Of passing troops in the sun's <mark3>beam--</mark3><br>
Pennon, and plume, and flashing <mark3>lance!</mark3><br>
Forth to the world those soldiers <mark4>fare,</mark4><br>
To life, to cities, and to <mark4>war!</mark4><br>
<br>
And through the wood, another <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
Faint bugle-notes from far are <mark4>borne,</mark4><br>
Where hunters gather, staghounds <mark1>bay,</mark1><br>
Round some fair forest-lodge at <mark3>morn.</mark3><br>
Gay dames are there, in sylvan <mark4>green;</mark4><br>
Laughter and cries--those notes <mark3>between!</mark3><br>
<br>
The banners flashing through the <mark1>trees</mark1><br>
Make their blood dance and chain their <mark4>eyes;</mark4><br>
That bugle-music on the <mark1>breeze</mark1><br>
Arrests them with a charm'd <mark4>surprise.</mark4><br>
Banner by turns and bugle <mark5>woo:</mark5><br>
Ye shy recluses, follow <mark3>too!</mark3><br>
<br>
O children, what do ye <mark3>reply?--</mark3><br>
"Action and pleasure, will ye <mark4>roam</mark4><br>
Through these secluded dells to <mark3>cry</mark3><br>
And call us?--but too late ye <mark1>come!</mark1><br>
Too late for us your call ye <mark3>blow,</mark3><br>
Whose bent was taken long <mark1>ago.</mark1><br>
<br>
"Long since we pace this shadow'd <mark3>nave;</mark3><br>
We watch those yellow tapers <mark4>shine,</mark4><br>
Emblems of hope over the <mark1>grave,</mark1><br>
In the high altar's depth <mark3>divine;</mark3><br>
The organ carries to our <mark4>ear</mark4><br>
Its accents of another <mark3>sphere.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Fenced early in this cloistral <mark1>round</mark1><br>
Of reverie, of shade, of <mark1>prayer,</mark1><br>
How should we grow in other <mark3>ground?</mark3><br>
How can we flower in foreign <mark3>air?</mark3><br>
--Pass, banners, pass, and bugles, <mark4>cease;</mark4><br>
And leave our desert to its <mark3>peace!"</mark3><br>
