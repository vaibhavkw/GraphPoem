Title : Low Barometer <br>
Author : Robert Bridges <br><br>

The south-wind strengthens to a <mark3>gale,</mark3><br>
Across the moon the clouds fly <mark3>fast,</mark3><br>
The house is smitten as with a <mark3>flail,</mark3><br>
The chimney shudders to the <mark3>blast.</mark3><br>
<br>
On such a <mark4>night</mark4>, when Air has <mark4>loosed</mark4><br>
Its guardian grasp on blood and <mark3>brain,</mark3><br>
Old terrors then of god or <mark4>ghost</mark4><br>
Creep from their caves to life <mark3>again;</mark3><br>
<br>
And Reason kens he herits <mark4>in</mark4><br>
A haunted house. Tenants <mark4>unknown</mark4><br>
Assert their squalid lease of <mark4>sin</mark4><br>
With earlier title than his <mark4>own.</mark4><br>
<br>
Unbodied <mark4>presences</mark4>, the <mark4>pack'd</mark4><br>
Pollution and remorse of <mark3>Time,</mark3><br>
Slipp'd from oblivion <mark4>reenact</mark4><br>
The horrors of unhouseld <mark3>crime.</mark3><br>
<br>
Some men would quell the thing with <mark4>prayer</mark4><br>
Whose sightless footsteps pad the <mark4>floor,</mark4><br>
Whose fearful trespass mounts the <mark4>stair</mark4><br>
Or burts the lock'd forbidden <mark4>door.</mark4><br>
<br>
Some have seen corpses long interr'd<br>
Escape from hallowing <mark4>control,</mark4><br>
Pale charnel forms--nay ev'n have <mark4>heard</mark4><br>
The shrilling of a troubled <mark3>soul,</mark3><br>
<br>
That wanders till the dawn hath <mark4>cross'd</mark4><br>
The dolorous dark, or Earth hath <mark4>wound</mark4><br>
Closer her storm-spredd cloke, and <mark4>thrust</mark4><br>
The baleful phantoms <mark4>underground.</mark4><br>
