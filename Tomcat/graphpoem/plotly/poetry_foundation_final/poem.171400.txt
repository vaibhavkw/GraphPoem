Title : The Vacuum <br>
Author : Howard Nemerov <br><br>

The house is so quiet now <br>
The vacuum cleaner sulks in the corner <mark4>closet,</mark4><br>
Its bag limp as a stopped lung, its <mark4>mouth</mark4><br>
Grinning into the floor, maybe at my <br>
Slovenly life, my dog-dead <mark4>youth.</mark4><br>
<br>
I've lived this way long enough, <br>
But when my old woman died her <mark4>soul</mark4><br>
Went into that vacuum cleaner, and I can't <mark4>bear</mark4><br>
To see the bag swell like a belly, eating the <mark4>dust</mark4><br>
And the woolen mice, and begin to <mark4>howl</mark4><br>
<br>
Because there is old filth <mark4>everywhere</mark4><br>
She used to crawl, in the corner and under the <mark4>stair.</mark4><br>
I know now how life is cheap as <mark4>dirt,</mark4><br>
And still the hungry, angry <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
Hangs on and howls, biting at <mark3>air.</mark3><br>
