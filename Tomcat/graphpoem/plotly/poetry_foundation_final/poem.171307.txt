Title : The Intruder <br>
Author : Carolyn Kizer <br><br>

My mother--preferring the strange to the tame: <br>
Dove-note, bone marrow, deer <mark3>dung,</mark3><br>
Frog's belly distended with finny <mark3>young,</mark3><br>
Leaf-mold wilderness, harebell, toadstool, <br>
Odd, small snakes roving through the <mark4>leaves,</mark4><br>
Metallic beetles rambling over stones: all <br>
Wild and natural!--flashed out her instinctive love, and quick, she   <br>
Picked up the fluttering, bleeding bat the cat laid at her <mark3>feet,</mark3><br>
And held the little horror to the mirror, <mark4>where</mark4><br>
He gazed on <mark4>himself</mark4>, and shrieked like an old screen door far <mark4>off.</mark4><br>
<br>
Depended from her pinched thumb, each <mark4>wing</mark4><br>
Came clattering down like a small black shutter. <br>
Still tranquil, she began, "It's rather sweet <mark3>..."</mark3><br>
The soft mouse body, the hard feral <mark4>glint</mark4><br>
In the caught eyes. Then we <mark3>saw,</mark3><br>
And recoiled: lice, pallid, yellow, <br>
Nested within the wing-pits, cozily sucked and snoozed.   <br>
The thing dropped from her hands, and with its <mark4>thud,</mark4><br>
Swiftly, the cat, with a clean careful mouth <br>
Closed on the soiled webs, growling, took them out to the back <mark5>stoop.</mark5><br>
<br>
But still, dark blood, a sticky puddle on the <mark4>floor</mark4><br>
Remained, of all my mother's tender, wounding <mark4>passion</mark4><br>
For a whole wild, lost, betrayed, and secret <mark4>life</mark4><br>
Among its dens and <mark4>burrows</mark4>, its clean <mark4>stones,</mark4><br>
Whose denizens can turn upon the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
With spitting tongue, an odor, talon, <mark3>claw,</mark3><br>
To sting or soil benevolence, <mark4>alien</mark4><br>
As our clumsy traps, our random scatter of <mark4>shot.</mark4><br>
She swept to the kitchen. Turning on the <mark4>tap,</mark4><br>
She washed and washed the pity from her <mark4>hands.</mark4><br>
