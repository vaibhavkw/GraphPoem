Title : Fragment 2: I know 'tis but a Dream, yet feel more anguish <br>
Author : Samuel Taylor Coleridge <br><br>

I know 'tis but a Dream, yet feel more anguish<br>
Than if 'twere Truth. It has been often so:<br>
Must I die under it? Is no one near?<br>
Will no one hear these stifled groans and wake me?<br>
