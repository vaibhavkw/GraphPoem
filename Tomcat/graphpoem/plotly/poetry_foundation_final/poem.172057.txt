Title : Adam's Curse <br>
Author : William Butler Yeats <br><br>

We sat together at one summer's <mark3>end,</mark3><br>
That beautiful mild woman, your close <mark3>friend,</mark3><br>
And you and I, and talked of <mark4>poetry.</mark4><br>
I said, 'A line will take us hours <mark4>maybe;</mark4><br>
Yet if it does not seem a moment's <mark3>thought,</mark3><br>
Our stitching and unstitching has been <mark3>naught.</mark3><br>
Better go down upon your <mark3>marrow-bones</mark3><br>
And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break <mark3>stones</mark3><br>
Like an old <mark4>pauper</mark4>, in all kinds of <mark4>weather;</mark4><br>
For to articulate sweet sounds <mark3>together</mark3><br>
Is to work harder than all these, and <mark4>yet</mark4><br>
Be thought an idler by the noisy <mark3>set</mark3><br>
Of bankers, schoolmasters, and <mark4>clergymen</mark4><br>
The martyrs call the <mark4>world.'</mark4><br>
And <mark4>thereupon</mark4><br>
That beautiful mild woman for whose <mark4>sake</mark4><br>
There's many a one shall find out all <mark4>heartache</mark4><br>
On finding that her voice is sweet and <mark3>low</mark3><br>
Replied, 'To be born woman is to <mark3>know--</mark3><br>
Although they do not talk of it at <mark4>school--</mark4><br>
That we must labour to be <mark4>beautiful.'</mark4><br>
I said, 'It's certain there is no fine thing   <br>
Since Adam's fall but needs much labouring. <br>
There have been lovers who thought love should <mark3>be</mark3><br>
So much compounded of high <mark4>courtesy</mark4><br>
That they would sigh and quote with learned <mark3>looks</mark3><br>
Precedents out of beautiful old <mark3>books;</mark3><br>
Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.' <br>
<br>
We sat grown quiet at the name of <mark4>love;</mark4><br>
We saw the last embers of daylight <mark3>die,</mark3><br>
And in the trembling blue-green of the <mark3>sky</mark3><br>
A moon, worn as if it had been a <mark4>shell</mark4><br>
Washed by time's waters as they rose and <mark3>fell</mark3><br>
About the stars and broke in days and <mark4>years.</mark4><br>
<br>
I had a thought for no one's but your <mark3>ears:</mark3><br>
That you were beautiful, and that I <mark4>strove</mark4><br>
To love you in the old high way of <mark1>love;</mark1><br>
That it had all seemed happy, and yet we'd <mark4>grown</mark4><br>
As weary-hearted as that hollow <mark4>moon.</mark4><br>
