Title : The Sorrow of Love <br>
Author : William Butler Yeats <br><br>

The brawling of a sparrow in the <mark3>eaves,</mark3><br>
The brilliant moon and all the milky <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
And all that famous harmony of <mark3>leaves,</mark3><br>
Had blotted out man's image and his <mark3>cry.</mark3><br>
<br>
A girl arose that had red mournful <mark3>lips</mark3><br>
And seemed the greatness of the world in <mark4>tears,</mark4><br>
Doomed like Odysseus and the labouring <mark3>ships</mark3><br>
And proud as Priam murdered with his <mark3>peers;</mark3><br>
<br>
<mark4>Arose</mark4>, and on the instant clamorous <mark1>eaves,</mark1><br>
A climbing moon upon an empty <mark1>sky,</mark1><br>
And all that lamentation of the <mark1>leaves,</mark1><br>
Could but compose man's image and his <mark1>cry.</mark1><br>
