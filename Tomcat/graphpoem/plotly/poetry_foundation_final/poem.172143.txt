Author : Cathy Song <br><br>

Somebody been giving you Stink <mark1>Eye?</mark1><br>
Let me tell you about Stink <mark1>Eye.</mark1><br>
Stink Eye no mean <mark4>nothing</mark4><br>
when you owe somebody <mark4>money.</mark4><br>
Pay up, girl. No be in <mark4>debt.</mark4><br>
But Stink Eye means <mark4>something</mark4><br>
when you owe somebody <mark1>nothing.</mark1><br>
Remember when Connie Mamazuka, the girl with the <mark4>mustache,</mark4><br>
grabbed your lipstick in the PE locker <mark1>room</mark1><br>
and smeared it all over her big fat <mark5>lips?</mark5><br>
Wasn't 'cause she like your <mark5>lipstick.</mark5><br>
Was 'cause you was one cute skinny <mark4>chick.</mark4><br>
She was giving you Stink Eye all <mark4>along</mark4><br>
and you never even know <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
Now you know <mark1>it</mark1><br>
and now you watch for <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
You was always catching Stink <mark1>Eye,</mark1><br>
always crying to your mother about <mark4>somebody</mark4><br>
icing you <mark4>out.</mark4><br>
When Stink Eye is cold, it is fucking <mark4>freezing,</mark4><br>
it can make you shiver and <mark3>cry,</mark3><br>
"But Mommy, Mommy, what did I <mark3>do?"</mark3><br>
Took you long time to know <br>
you never do <mark1>nothing</mark1><br>
but you was good at <mark1>something,</mark1><br>
something Stink Eye like try <mark3>steal</mark3><br>
not 'cause Stink Eye going use <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
Stink Eye just no <mark4>like</mark4><br>
you use <mark1>it</mark1><br>
'cause if you use <mark1>it</mark1><br>
only going make Stink Eye <mark3>feel</mark3><br>
more ugly, feel more <mark4>stupid.</mark4><br>
Easy for <mark4>spot</mark4><br>
Stink Eye coming from one mousy <mark4>thing.</mark4><br>
More tricky for <mark1>spot</mark1><br>
Stink Eye coming from some of the friendliest <mark4>faces.</mark4><br>
And you the dumb one, left dazed and <mark4>hurt.</mark4><br>
"But she seemed so <mark4>sympathetic."</mark4><br>
Yeah, <mark4>right.</mark4><br>
Stink Eye sideswipes into <mark3>you</mark3><br>
out of <mark4>nowhere</mark4><br>
where somebody been <mark4>thinking</mark4><br>
evil thoughts about <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
wishing bad luck to blow bad breath upon <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
knock you <mark4>down,</mark4><br>
forget your <mark4>words,</mark4><br>
drop your <mark4>tools,</mark4><br>
make you sputter and <mark4>drool.</mark4><br>
Under the <mark4>bed,</mark4><br>
in Stink Eye's <mark1>room,</mark1><br>
get one picture of <mark1>you</mark1><br>
stabbed like one pin <mark4>cushion</mark4><br>
with so many needles, <mark4>stabbed</mark4><br>
like one cactus, stabbed like one <mark4>porcupine.</mark4><br>
Stink Eye even dreams about <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
Careful of that coat you <mark4>wear,</mark4><br>
the one you blossom <mark1>in</mark1>, feel loved <mark4>in,</mark4><br>
the one that keeps you <mark4>warm.</mark4><br>
Stink Eye like snatch it right off <mark1>you</mark1><br>
'cause Stink Eye just no can stand to see <br>
you look so <mark3>cool.</mark3><br>
Stink Eye wants a piece of <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
So choose to be naive, girl, or wake up <br>
'cause Stink Eye been waiting to sit on your <mark4>chest,</mark4><br>
pounce on your <mark4>flesh,</mark4><br>
squeeze the living air right out of <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
watch you flatten like one used-up tube of <mark4>toothpaste.</mark4><br>
Suck up your <mark4>goodies,</mark4><br>
<br>
ready to gorge on your <mark4>talents,</mark4><br>
feast on your <mark4>fears.</mark4><br>
So girl, run fast, spell good, write well, add up, think <mark4>quick,</mark4><br>
talk sharp, walk pretty, jump high, throw hard, sing <mark4>sweet,</mark4><br>
leap <mark4>far.</mark4><br>
Now you know <mark1>it</mark1><br>
and now you watch for <mark1>it</mark1><br>
'cause Stink Eye gets bigger and meaner and <mark1>stronger</mark1><br>
as you get better and smarter and <mark1>stronger.</mark1><br>
Scary thing about Stink <mark1>Eye,</mark1><br>
Stink Eye always looking for <mark4>more--</mark4><br>
as much as you willing to give.<br>
