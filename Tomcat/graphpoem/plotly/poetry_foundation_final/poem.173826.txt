Title : Do you Remember me? or are you Proud? <br>
Author : Walter Savage Landor <br><br>

"Do you remember me? or are you <mark3>proud?"</mark3><br>
Lightly advancing thro' her star-trimm'd <mark3>crowd,</mark3><br>
Ianthe said, and lookt into my <mark3>eyes,</mark3><br>
"A yes, a yes, to both: for <mark4>Memory</mark4><br>
Where you but once have been must ever <mark4>be,</mark4><br>
And at your voice Pride from his throne must <mark3>rise."</mark3><br>
