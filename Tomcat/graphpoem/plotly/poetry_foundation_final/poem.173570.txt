Title : On the Death of Richard West <br>
Author : Thomas Gray <br><br>

In vain to me the smiling Mornings <mark4>shine,</mark4><br>
And reddening Phoebus lifts his golden <mark3>fire;</mark3><br>
The birds in vain their amorous descant <mark4>join;</mark4><br>
Or cheerful fields resume their green <mark3>attire;</mark3><br>
These ears, alas! for other notes repine,<br>
A different object do these eyes <mark3>require;</mark3><br>
My lonely anguish melts no heart but <mark4>mine;</mark4><br>
And in my breast the imperfect joys <mark3>expire.</mark3><br>
Yet Morning smiles the busy race to <mark4>cheer,</mark4><br>
And new-born pleasure brings to happier <mark4>men;</mark4><br>
The fields to all their wonted tribute <mark4>bear;</mark4><br>
To warm their little loves the birds <mark4>complain;</mark4><br>
I fruitless mourn to him that cannot <mark4>hear,</mark4><br>
And weep the more because I weep in <mark3>vain.</mark3><br>
