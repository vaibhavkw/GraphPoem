Title : The Wreckage <br>
Author : Donald Hall <br><br>

At the edge of the city the <mark4>pickerel</mark4><br>
vomits and dies. The <mark4>river</mark4><br>
with its white hair staggers to the <mark1>sea.</mark1><br>
<br>
My life lay crumpled like a smashed <mark4>car.</mark4><br>
<br>
Windows barred, ivy, square <mark4>stone.</mark4><br>
Lines gather at mouth and at <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
like cracks in a <mark4>membrane.</mark4><br>
Eyeballs and tongue spill on the <mark4>floor</mark4><br>
in a puddle of yolks and <mark4>whites.</mark4><br>
<br>
The intact 707 <br>
under the clear wave, the sun <mark5>shining.</mark5><br>
<br>
The playhouse of my grandfather's <mark4>mother</mark4><br>
stands north of the shed: <mark4>spiders</mark4><br>
and the dolls' teacups of dead <mark4>women.</mark4><br>
In Ohio the K Mart <mark4>shrugs;</mark4><br>
it knows it is going to die. <br>
<br>
A stone, the closed eye of the <mark4>dirt.</mark4><br>
<br>
Outside before <mark4>dawn</mark4><br>
houses sail up <br>
like wrecks from the bottom of the <mark1>sea.</mark1><br>
A door clicks; a light <mark4>opens.</mark4><br>
<br>
If the world is a dream, <br>
so is the puffed stomach of <mark4>Juan,</mark4><br>
and the rich in Connecticut are <mark4>dreamers.</mark4><br>
<br>
There are <mark4>bachelors</mark4><br>
who live in shacks made of oil <mark4>cans</mark4><br>
and broken doors, who stitch their <mark4>shirts</mark4><br>
until the cloth disappears under <mark4>stitches,</mark4><br>
who collect nails in Ball <mark4>jars.</mark4><br>
<br>
A trolley car comes out of the <mark4>elms,</mark4><br>
the tracks laid through an acre of wheat <mark4>stubble,</mark4><br>
slanting downhill. I board <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
and cross the field into the new <mark4>pine.</mark4><br>
