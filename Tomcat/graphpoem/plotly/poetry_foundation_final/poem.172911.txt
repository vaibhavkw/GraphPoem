Title : The Clod and the Pebble <br>
Author : William Blake <br><br>

"Love seeketh not itself to <mark3>please,</mark3><br>
Nor for itself hath any <mark3>care,</mark3><br>
But for another gives its <mark3>ease,</mark3><br>
And builds a Heaven in Hell's <mark3>despair."</mark3><br>
<br>
So sung a little Clod of Clay <br>
Trodden with the cattle's <mark3>feet,</mark3><br>
But a Pebble of the brook <br>
Warbled out these metres <mark3>meet:</mark3><br>
<br>
"Love seeketh only self to <mark1>please,</mark1><br>
To bind another to its <mark4>delight,</mark4><br>
Joys in another's loss of <mark1>ease,</mark1><br>
And builds a Hell in Heaven's <mark3>despite."</mark3><br>
