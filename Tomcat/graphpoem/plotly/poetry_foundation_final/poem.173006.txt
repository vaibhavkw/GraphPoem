Title : Confessions <br>
Author : Robert Browning <br><br>

What is he buzzing in my <mark3>ears?</mark3><br>
"Now that I come to <mark3>die,</mark3><br>
Do I view the world as a vale of <mark3>tears?"</mark3><br>
Ah, reverend sir, not <mark3>I!</mark3><br>
<br>
What I viewed there once, what I view <mark3>again</mark3><br>
Where the physic bottles <mark3>stand</mark3><br>
On the table's edge,--is a suburb <mark3>lane,</mark3><br>
With a wall to my bedside <mark3>hand.</mark3><br>
<br>
That lane sloped, much as the bottles <mark3>do,</mark3><br>
      From a house you could descry<br>
O'er the garden-wall; is the curtain <mark3>blue</mark3><br>
Or green to a healthy <mark2>eye?</mark2><br>
<br>
To mine, it serves for the old June <mark4>weather</mark4><br>
Blue above lane and <mark3>wall;</mark3><br>
And that farthest bottle labelled <mark4>"Ether"</mark4><br>
Is the house o'ertopping <mark3>all.</mark3><br>
<br>
At a terrace, somewhere near the <mark4>stopper,</mark4><br>
There watched for me, one <mark4>June,</mark4><br>
A girl: I know, sir, it's <mark3>improper,</mark3><br>
My poor mind's out of <mark3>tune.</mark3><br>
<br>
Only, there was a way... you <mark3>crept</mark3><br>
Close by the side, to <mark3>dodge</mark3><br>
Eyes in the house, two eyes <mark3>except:</mark3><br>
They styled their house "The <mark3>Lodge."</mark3><br>
<br>
What right had a lounger up their <mark1>lane?</mark1><br>
But, by creeping very <mark4>close,</mark4><br>
With the good wall's help,--their eyes might <mark3>strain</mark3><br>
      And stretch themselves to Oes,<br>
<br>
Yet never catch her and me <mark4>together,</mark4><br>
As she left the attic, <mark3>there,</mark3><br>
By the rim of the bottle labelled <mark1>"Ether,"</mark1><br>
And stole from stair to <mark3>stair,</mark3><br>
<br>
And stood by the rose-wreathed gate. <mark4>Alas,</mark4><br>
We loved, sir--used to <mark4>meet:</mark4><br>
How sad and bad and mad it <mark4>was--</mark4><br>
But then, how it was <mark3>sweet!</mark3><br>
