Title : The Solitary Reaper <br>
Author : William Wordsworth <br><br>

Behold her, single in the <mark4>field,</mark4><br>
Yon solitary Highland <mark3>Lass!</mark3><br>
Reaping and singing by herself;<br>
Stop here, or gently <mark3>pass!</mark3><br>
Alone she cuts and binds the <mark3>grain,</mark3><br>
And sings a melancholy <mark3>strain;</mark3><br>
O listen! for the Vale <mark4>profound</mark4><br>
Is overflowing with the <mark3>sound.</mark3><br>
<br>
No Nightingale did ever chaunt<br>
More welcome notes to weary <mark3>bands</mark3><br>
Of travellers in some shady haunt,<br>
Among Arabian <mark3>sands:</mark3><br>
A voice so thrilling ne'er was <mark4>heard</mark4><br>
In spring-time from the <mark3>Cuckoo-bird,</mark3><br>
Breaking the silence of the <mark4>seas</mark4><br>
Among the farthest <mark4>Hebrides.</mark4><br>
<br>
Will no one tell me what she <mark4>sings?--</mark4><br>
Perhaps the plaintive numbers <mark3>flow</mark3><br>
For old, unhappy, far-off <mark3>things,</mark3><br>
And battles long <mark3>ago:</mark3><br>
Or is it some more humble <mark3>lay,</mark3><br>
Familiar matter of <mark3>to-day?</mark3><br>
Some natural sorrow, loss, or <mark3>pain,</mark3><br>
That has <mark4>been</mark4>, and may be <mark3>again?</mark3><br>
<br>
Whate'er the theme, the Maiden <mark5>sang</mark5><br>
As if her song could have no <mark4>ending;</mark4><br>
I saw her singing at her work,<br>
And o'er the sickle <mark3>bending;--</mark3><br>
I listened, motionless and <mark3>still;</mark3><br>
And, as I mounted up the <mark3>hill,</mark3><br>
The music in my heart I <mark3>bore,</mark3><br>
Long after it was heard no <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
