Title : There was a little girl <br>
Author : Henry Wadsworth Longfellow <br><br>

There was a little <mark3>girl,</mark3><br>
Who had a little <mark3>curl,</mark3><br>
Right in the middle of her <mark4>forehead.</mark4><br>
When she was <mark4>good,</mark4><br>
She was very good <mark4>indeed,</mark4><br>
But when she was bad she was <mark4>horrid.</mark4><br>
