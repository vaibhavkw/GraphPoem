Title : I Dreamed That in a City Dark as Paris <br>
Author : Louis Simpson <br><br>

I dreamed that in a city dark as <mark4>Paris</mark4><br>
I stood alone in a deserted <mark4>square.</mark4><br>
The night was trembling with a <mark4>violet</mark4><br>
Expectancy. At the far edge it <mark4>moved</mark4><br>
And rumbled; on that flickering <mark4>horizon</mark4><br>
The guns were pumping color in the <mark1>sky.</mark1><br>
<br>
There was the Front. But I was lonely <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
Left behind, abandoned by the army.   <br>
The empty city and the empty <mark1>square</mark1><br>
Was my inhabitation, my <mark4>unrest.</mark4><br>
The helmet with its vestige of a <mark3>crest,</mark3><br>
The rifle in my hands, long out of <mark4>date,</mark4><br>
The belt I wore, the trailing <mark4>overcoat</mark4><br>
And hobnail boots, were those of a poilu.   <br>
I was the man, as awkward as a <mark3>bear.</mark3><br>
<br>
Over the rooftops where cathedrals <mark4>loomed</mark4><br>
In speaking majesty, two aeroplanes <br>
Forlorn as birds, appeared. Then growing large,   <br>
The German Taube and the Nieuport <mark4>Scout,</mark4><br>
They chased each other tumbling through the <mark1>sky,</mark1><br>
Till one streamed down on fire to the earth. <br>
<br>
These wars have been so great, they are <mark4>forgotten</mark4><br>
Like the Egyptian dynasts. My <mark4>confrere</mark4><br>
In whose thick boots I <mark4>stood</mark4>, were you <mark4>amazed</mark4><br>
To wander through my brain four decades later   <br>
As I have wandered in a dream through yours? <br>
<br>
The violence of waking life <mark4>disrupts</mark4><br>
The order of our death. Strange dreams <mark3>occur,</mark3><br>
For dreams are licensed as they never <mark3>were.</mark3><br>
