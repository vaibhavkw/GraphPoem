Title : The Wreck of the Thresher <br>
Author : William Meredith <br><br>

(Lost at Sea, April 10, 1963)<br>
I stand on the ledge where rock runs into the <mark4>river</mark4><br>
As the night turns brackish with morning, and mourn the <mark3>drowned.</mark3><br>
Here the sea is diluted with river; I watch it slaver <br>
Like a dog curing of rabies. Its ravening <mark4>over,</mark4><br>
Lickspittle ocean nuzzles the dry <mark3>ground.</mark3><br>
(But the dream that woke me was worse than the sea's <mark3>gray</mark3><br>
Slip-slap; there are no such sounds by <mark3>day.)</mark3><br>
<br>
This crushing of people is something we live <mark4>with.</mark4><br>
Daily, by unaccountable <mark4>whim</mark4><br>
Or caught up in some harebrained scheme of <mark4>death,</mark4><br>
Tangled in cars, dropped from the sky, in <mark4>flame,</mark4><br>
Men and women break the pledge of <mark3>breath:</mark3><br>
And now under water, gone all jetsam and <mark4>small</mark4><br>
In the pressure of oceans collected, a squad of brave men in a <mark4>hull.</mark4><br>
<br>
(Why can't our dreams be content with the terrible <mark3>facts?</mark3><br>
The only animal cursed with responsible <mark3>sleep,</mark3><br>
We trace disaster always to our own <mark3>acts.</mark3><br>
I met a monstrous self trapped in the black <mark3>deep:</mark3><br>
All these years, he smiled, I've drilled at <mark3>sea</mark3><br>
For this crush of water. Then he saved only <mark3>me.)</mark3><br>
<br>
We invest ships with life. Look at a <mark4>harbor</mark4><br>
At first light: with better grace than <mark3>men</mark3><br>
In their movements the vessels run to their <mark4>labors</mark4><br>
Working the fields that the tide has made green <mark3>again;</mark3><br>
Their beauty is womanly, they are named for ladies and <mark4>queens,</mark4><br>
Although by a wise superstition these are <mark4>called</mark4><br>
After fish, the finned boats, silent and <mark4>submarine.</mark4><br>
The crushing of any ship has always been <mark4>held</mark4><br>
In <mark4>dread</mark4>, like a house burned or a great tree <mark3>felled.</mark3><br>
<br>
I think of how sailors laugh, as if cold and <mark3>wet</mark3><br>
And dark and lost were their private, funny <mark4>derision</mark4><br>
And I can judge then what dark <mark4>compression</mark4><br>
Astonishes them now, their sunken faces <mark3>set</mark3><br>
Unsmiling, where the currents sluice to and <mark3>fro</mark3><br>
And without humor, somewhere northeast of here and <mark3>below.</mark3><br>
<br>
<mark4>(Sea-brothers</mark4>, I lower to you the ingenuity of <mark4>dreams,</mark4><br>
Strange lungs and bells to escape in; let me stay aboard <mark4>last?</mark4><br>
We amend our dreams in half-sleep. Then it <mark3>seems</mark3><br>
Easy to talk to the severe dead and explain the <mark3>past.</mark3><br>
Now they are saying, Do not be ashamed to stay <mark4>alive,</mark4><br>
You have dreamt nothing that we do not <mark4>forgive.</mark4><br>
And gentlier, Study something deeper than <mark4>yourselves,</mark4><br>
As, how the heart, when it turns diver, delves and <mark4>saves.)</mark4><br>
<br>
Whether we give assent to this or <mark3>rage</mark3><br>
Is a question of temperament and does not <mark4>matter.</mark4><br>
Some will has been done past our <mark4>understanding,</mark4><br>
Past our guilt surely, equal to our <mark4>fears.</mark4><br>
Dullards, we are set again to the cryptic blank <mark3>page</mark3><br>
Where the sea schools us with terrible <mark4>water.</mark4><br>
The noise of a boat breaking up and its men is in our <mark3>ears.</mark3><br>
The bottom here is too far down for our <mark4>sounding;</mark4><br>
The ocean was salt before we crawled to <mark3>tears.</mark3><br>
