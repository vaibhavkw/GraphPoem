Title : A Coronet for his Mistress, Philosophy <br>
Author : George Chapman <br><br>

Muses that sing love's sensual empery,<br>
And lovers kindling your enraged <mark3>fires</mark3><br>
At Cupid's bonfires burning in the eye,<br>
Blown with the empty breath of vain <mark3>desires;</mark3><br>
You that prefer the painted <mark4>cabinet</mark4><br>
Before the wealthy jewels it doth store <mark3>ye,</mark3><br>
That all your joys in dying figures <mark4>set,</mark4><br>
And stain the living substance of your <mark4>glory;</mark4><br>
Abjure those joys, abhor their <mark4>memory,</mark4><br>
And let my love the honour'd subject <mark4>be</mark4><br>
Of love, and honour's complete <mark4>history.</mark4><br>
Your eyes were never yet let in to <mark3>see</mark3><br>
The majesty and riches of the <mark3>mind,</mark3><br>
But dwell in darkness; for your god is <mark3>blind.</mark3><br>
