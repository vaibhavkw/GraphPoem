Title : Song for Ishtar <br>
Author : Denise Levertov <br><br>

The moon is a <mark1>sow</mark1><br>
and grunts in my <mark4>throat</mark4><br>
Her great shining shines through me   <br>
so the mud of my hollow <mark4>gleams</mark4><br>
and breaks in silver <mark4>bubbles</mark4><br>
<br>
She is a <mark1>sow</mark1><br>
and I a pig and a <mark4>poet</mark4><br>
<br>
When she opens her <mark4>white</mark4><br>
lips to devour me I bite back   <br>
and laughter rocks the moon <br>
<br>
In the black of desire <br>
we rock and grunt, grunt and   <br>
