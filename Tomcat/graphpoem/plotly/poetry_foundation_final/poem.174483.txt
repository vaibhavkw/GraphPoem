Author : Edmund Spenser <br><br>

By that he ended had his ghostly <mark4>sermon,</mark4><br>
The fox was well induc'd to be a <mark4>parson,</mark4><br>
And of the priest eftsoons gan to <mark3>inquire,</mark3><br>
How to a benefice he might <mark3>aspire.</mark3><br>
"Marry, there" (said the priest) "is art <mark3>indeed:</mark3><br>
Much good deep learning one thereout may <mark3>read;</mark3><br>
For that the ground-work is, and end of <mark4>all,</mark4><br>
How to obtain a <mark4>beneficial.</mark4><br>
First, therefore, when ye have in handsome <mark3>wise</mark3><br>
Yourself attired, as you can <mark3>devise,</mark3><br>
Then to some nobleman yourself <mark3>apply,</mark3><br>
Or other great one in the worldes <mark3>eye,</mark3><br>
That hath a zealous <mark4>disposition</mark4><br>
To God, and so to his <mark4>religion.</mark4><br>
There must thou fashion eke a godly <mark4>zeal,</mark4><br>
Such as no carpers may contrare <mark3>reveal;</mark3><br>
For each thing feigned ought more wary <mark4>be.</mark4><br>
There thou must walk in sober <mark4>gravity,</mark4><br>
And seem as saint-like as Saint Radegund: <br>
Fast much, pray oft, look lowly on the <mark4>ground,</mark4><br>
And unto every one do courtesy <mark3>meek:</mark3><br>
These looks (nought saying) do a benefice <mark3>seek,</mark3><br>
But be thou sure one not to lack or <mark3>long.</mark3><br>
And if thee list unto the court to <mark3>throng,</mark3><br>
And there to hunt after the hoped <mark3>prey,</mark3><br>
Then must thou thee dispose another <mark3>way:</mark3><br>
For there thou needs must learn to laugh, to <mark3>lie,</mark3><br>
To face, to forge, to scoff, to <mark5>company,</mark5><br>
To crouch, to please, to be a <mark4>beetle-stock</mark4><br>
Of thy great master's will, to scorn, or <mark3>mock.</mark3><br>
So may'st thou chance mock out a <mark5>benefice,</mark5><br>
Unless thou canst one conjure by <mark2>device,</mark2><br>
Or cast a figure for a bishopric; <br>
And if one could, it were but a school <mark4>trick.</mark4><br>
These be the ways by which without <mark4>reward</mark4><br>
Livings in court be gotten, though full <mark4>hard;</mark4><br>
For nothing there is done without a <mark3>fee:</mark3><br>
The courtier needs must recompensed <mark1>be</mark1><br>
With a benevolence, or have in <mark4>gage</mark4><br>
The primitias of your <mark4>parsonage:</mark4><br>
Scarce can a bishopric forpass them <mark3>by,</mark3><br>
But that it must be gelt in privity. <br>
Do not thou therefore seek a living <mark4>there,</mark4><br>
But of more private persons seek <mark4>elsewhere,</mark4><br>
Whereas thou may'st compound a better <mark4>penny,</mark4><br>
Ne let thy learning question'd be of <mark3>any.</mark3><br>
For some good gentleman, that hath the <mark3>right</mark3><br>
Unto his church for to present a <mark3>wight,</mark3><br>
Will cope with thee in reasonable <mark1>wise;</mark1><br>
That if the living yearly do <mark3>arise</mark3><br>
To forty pound, that then his youngest <mark4>son</mark4><br>
Shall twenty have, and twenty thou hast <mark3>won:</mark3><br>
Thou hast it won, for it is of frank <mark4>gift,</mark4><br>
And he will care for all the rest to <mark3>shift,</mark3><br>
Both that the bishop may admit of <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
And that therein thou may'st maintained <mark1>be.</mark1><br>
This is the way for one that is unlearn'd <br>
Living to get, and not to be <mark4>discern'd.</mark4><br>
But they that are great clerks, have nearer <mark4>ways,</mark4><br>
For learning sake to living them to <mark3>raise;</mark3><br>
Yet many eke of them (God wot) are <mark4>driven</mark4><br>
T' accept a benefice in pieces <mark3>riven.</mark3><br>
How say'st thou (friend), have I not well <mark5>discourst</mark5><br>
Upon this common-place (though plain, not <mark4>worst)?</mark4><br>
Better a short tale than a bad long shriving. <br>
Needs any more to learn to get a <mark4>living?"</mark4><br>
<br>
"Now sure, and by my halidom," (quoth <mark3>he)</mark3><br>
"Ye a great master are in your <mark3>degree:</mark3><br>
Great thanks I yield you for your <mark4>discipline,</mark4><br>
And do not doubt but duly to <mark4>incline</mark4><br>
My wits thereto, as ye shall shortly <mark4>hear."</mark4><br>
The priest him wish'd good speed, and well to <mark4>fare:</mark4><br>
So parted they, as either's way them <mark4>led.</mark4><br>
But th' ape and fox ere long so well them <mark3>sped,</mark3><br>
Through the priest's wholesome counsel lately <mark4>taught,</mark4><br>
And through their own fair handling wisely <mark3>wrought,</mark3><br>
That they a benefice 'twixt them <mark4>obtained;</mark4><br>
And crafty Reynold was a priest <mark3>ordained,</mark3><br>
And th' ape his parish clerk procur'd to <mark1>be.</mark1><br>
Then made they revel rout and goodly <mark3>glee;</mark3><br>
But, ere long time had passed, they so <mark4>ill</mark4><br>
Did order their affairs, that th' evil <mark3>will</mark3><br>
Of all their parish'ners they had <mark4>constrain'd;</mark4><br>
Who to the Ordinary of them <mark3>complain'd,</mark3><br>
How foully they their offices abus'd, <br>
And them of crimes and heresies accus'd, <br>
That pursuivants he often for them <mark4>sent;</mark4><br>
But they neglected his <mark5>commandement.</mark5><br>
So long persisted obstinate and <mark4>bold,</mark4><br>
Till at the length he published to <mark3>hold</mark3><br>
A visitation, and them cited <mark5>thether:</mark5><br>
Then was high time their wits about to geather. <br>
What did they <mark4>then</mark4>, but made a <mark4>composition</mark4><br>
With their next neighbour priest, for light <mark3>condition,</mark3><br>
To whom their living they resigned <mark4>quite</mark4><br>
For a few pence, and ran away by <mark3>night.</mark3><br>
