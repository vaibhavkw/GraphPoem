Title : Duns Scotus's Oxford <br>
Author : Gerard Manley Hopkins <br><br>

Towery city and branchy between <mark3>towers;</mark3><br>
Cuckoo-echoing, bell-swarmed, lark charmed, rook racked, <mark3>river-rounded;</mark3><br>
The dapple-eared lily below thee; that country and town <mark3>did</mark3><br>
Once encounter in, here coped & poised <mark3>powers;</mark3><br>
<br>
Thou hast a base and brickish skirt there, <mark3>sours</mark3><br>
That neighbour-nature thy grey beauty is <mark3>grounded</mark3><br>
Best in; graceless growth, thou hast <mark3>confounded</mark3><br>
Rural, rural keeping -- folk, flocks, and <mark3>flowers.</mark3><br>
<br>
Yet ah! this air I gather and I <mark3>release</mark3><br>
He lived on; these weeds and waters, these walls are <mark4>what</mark4><br>
He haunted who of all men most sways my spirits to <mark3>peace;</mark3><br>
<br>
Of realty the rarest-veined unraveller; a <mark4>not</mark4><br>
Rivalled insight, be rival Italy or <mark3>Greece;</mark3><br>
Who fired France for Mary without <mark3>spot.</mark3><br>
