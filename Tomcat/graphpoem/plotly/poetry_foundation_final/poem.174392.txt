Title : Julian and Maddalo <br>
Author : Percy Bysshe Shelley <br><br>

<br>
I rode one evening with Count <mark1>Maddalo</mark1><br>
Upon the bank of land which breaks the <mark3>flow</mark3><br>
Of Adria towards Venice: a bare <mark3>strand</mark3><br>
Of hillocks, heap'd from ever-shifting <mark3>sand,</mark3><br>
Matted with thistles and amphibious <mark3>weeds,</mark3><br>
Such as from earth's embrace the salt ooze <mark3>breeds,</mark3><br>
Is this; an uninhabited <mark4>sea-side,</mark4><br>
Which the lone fisher, when his nets are <mark4>dried,</mark4><br>
Abandons; and no other object <mark5>breaks</mark5><br>
The waste, but one dwarf tree and some few <mark3>stakes</mark3><br>
Broken and unrepair'd, and the tide <mark3>makes</mark3><br>
A narrow space of level sand <mark4>thereon,</mark4><br>
Where 'twas our wont to ride while day went <mark4>down.</mark4><br>
This ride was my <mark4>delight</mark4>, I love all <mark4>waste</mark4><br>
And solitary places; where we <mark3>taste</mark3><br>
The pleasure of believing what we <mark3>see</mark3><br>
Is boundless, as we wish our souls to <mark3>be:</mark3><br>
And such was this wide ocean, and this <mark3>shore</mark3><br>
More barren than its billows; and yet <mark3>more</mark3><br>
Than all, with a remember'd friend I <mark4>love</mark4><br>
To ride as then I rode; for the winds <mark4>drove</mark4><br>
The living spray along the sunny <mark4>air</mark4><br>
Into our faces; the blue heavens were <mark3>bare,</mark3><br>
Stripp'd to their depths by the awakening <mark3>north;</mark3><br>
And, from the waves, sound like delight broke <mark3>forth</mark3><br>
Harmonizing with solitude, and <mark4>sent</mark4><br>
Into our hearts aereal merriment.<br>
So, as we rode, we talk'd; and the swift <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
Winging itself with laughter, linger'd <mark4>not,</mark4><br>
But flew from brain to brain?such glee was <mark4>ours,</mark4><br>
Charg'd with light memories of remember'd <mark2>hours,</mark2><br>
None slow enough for sadness: till we <mark3>came</mark3><br>
Homeward, which always makes the spirit <mark3>tame.</mark3><br>
This day had been cheerful but cold, and now<br>
The sun was sinking, and the wind also.<br>
Our talk grew somewhat serious, as may <mark1>be</mark1><br>
Talk interrupted with such raillery<br>
As mocks itself, because it cannot <mark4>scorn</mark4><br>
The thoughts it would extinguish: 'twas <mark3>forlorn,</mark3><br>
Yet pleasing, such as once, so poets <mark3>tell,</mark3><br>
The devils held within the dales of <mark3>Hell</mark3><br>
Concerning God, freewill and <mark4>destiny:</mark4><br>
Of all that earth has been or yet may <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
All that vain men imagine or <mark4>believe,</mark4><br>
Or hope can paint or suffering may <mark3>achieve,</mark3><br>
We descanted, and I (for ever <mark4>still</mark4><br>
Is it not wise to make the best of <mark3>ill?)</mark3><br>
Argu'd against despondency, but <mark3>pride</mark3><br>
Made my companion take the darker <mark3>side.</mark3><br>
The sense that he was greater than his <mark4>kind</mark4><br>
Had struck, methinks, his eagle spirit <mark3>blind</mark3><br>
By gazing on its own exceeding <mark4>light.</mark4><br>
Meanwhile the sun paus'd ere it should <mark3>alight,</mark3><br>
Over the horizon of the mountains?Oh,<br>
How beautiful is sunset, when the <mark3>glow</mark3><br>
Of Heaven descends upon a land like <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
Thou Paradise of exiles, <mark4>Italy!</mark4><br>
Thy mountains, seas, and <mark4>vineyards</mark4>, and the <mark3>towers</mark3><br>
Of cities they encircle! It was <mark1>ours</mark1><br>
To stand on thee, beholding it: and <mark4>then,</mark4><br>
Just where we had dismounted, the Count's <mark3>men</mark3><br>
Were waiting for us with the <mark1>gondola.</mark1><br>
As those who pause on some delightful <mark3>way</mark3><br>
Though bent on pleasant pilgrimage, we <mark4>stood</mark4><br>
Looking upon the evening, and the <mark4>flood</mark4><br>
Which lay between the city and the <mark1>shore,</mark1><br>
Pav'd with the image of the sky.... The <mark3>hoar</mark3><br>
And aery Alps towards the North <mark4>appear'd</mark4><br>
Through mist, an heaven-sustaining bulwark <mark3>rear'd</mark3><br>
Between the East and West; and half the <mark3>sky</mark3><br>
Was roof'd with clouds of rich emblazonry<br>
Dark purple at the zenith, which still <mark3>grew</mark3><br>
Down the steep West into a wondrous <mark3>hue</mark3><br>
Brighter than burning gold, even to the <mark4>rent</mark4><br>
Where the swift sun yet paus'd in his <mark3>descent</mark3><br>
Among the many-folded hills: they were<br>
Those famous Euganean hills, which <mark4>bear,</mark4><br>
As seen from Lido thro' the harbour <mark4>piles,</mark4><br>
The likeness of a clump of peaked <mark3>isles?</mark3><br>
And then?as if the Earth and Sea had <mark4>been</mark4><br>
Dissolv'd into one lake of fire, were <mark4>seen</mark4><br>
Those mountains towering as from waves of <mark3>flame</mark3><br>
Around the vaporous sun, from which there <mark1>came</mark1><br>
The inmost purple spirit of light, and <mark4>made</mark4><br>
Their very peaks transparent. "Ere it <mark3>fade,"</mark3><br>
Said my <mark4>companion</mark4>, "I will show you <mark4>soon</mark4><br>
A better station"?so, o'er the lagune<br>
We glided; and from that funereal <mark5>bark</mark5><br>
I lean'd, and saw the city, and could <mark3>mark</mark3><br>
How from their many isles, in evening's <mark4>gleam,</mark4><br>
Its temples and its palaces did <mark3>seem</mark3><br>
Like fabrics of enchantment pil'd to <mark4>Heaven.</mark4><br>
I was about to speak, when?"We are <mark4>even</mark4><br>
Now at the point I meant," said <mark1>Maddalo,</mark1><br>
And bade the gondolieri cease to <mark3>row.</mark3><br>
"Look, Julian, on the west, and listen <mark4>well</mark4><br>
If you hear not a deep and heavy <mark3>bell."</mark3><br>
I look'd, and saw between us and the <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
A building on an island; such a <mark3>one</mark3><br>
As age to age might add, for uses <mark4>vile,</mark4><br>
A windowless, deform'd and dreary <mark3>pile;</mark3><br>
And on the top an open tower, where <mark3>hung</mark3><br>
A bell, which in the radiance sway'd and <mark3>swung;</mark3><br>
We could just hear its hoarse and iron <mark3>tongue:</mark3><br>
The broad sun sunk behind it, and it <mark4>toll'd</mark4><br>
In strong and black relief. "What we <mark4>behold</mark4><br>
Shall be the madhouse and its belfry <mark5>tower,"</mark5><br>
Said Maddalo, "and ever at this <mark3>hour</mark3><br>
Those who may cross the water, hear that <mark1>bell</mark1><br>
Which calls the maniacs, each one from his <mark3>cell,</mark3><br>
To vespers." "As much skill as need to <mark3>pray</mark3><br>
In thanks or hope for their dark lot have <mark3>they</mark3><br>
To their stern Maker," I replied. "O <mark3>ho!</mark3><br>
You talk as in years past," said <mark1>Maddalo.</mark1><br>
" 'Tis strange men change not. You were ever <mark1>still</mark1><br>
Among Christ's flock a perilous <mark4>infidel,</mark4><br>
A wolf for the meek lambs?if you can't <mark4>swim</mark4><br>
Beware of Providence." I look'd on <mark3>him,</mark3><br>
But the gay smile had faded in his <mark3>eye.</mark3><br>
"And such," he cried, "is our <mark4>mortality,</mark4><br>
And this must be the emblem and the <mark4>sign</mark4><br>
Of what should be eternal and <mark3>divine!</mark3><br>
And like that black and dreary <mark4>bell</mark4>, the <mark4>soul,</mark4><br>
Hung in a heaven-illumin'd tower, must <mark3>toll</mark3><br>
Our thoughts and our desires to meet <mark3>below</mark3><br>
Round the rent heart and pray?as madmen <mark3>do</mark3><br>
For what? they know not?till the night of <mark4>death,</mark4><br>
As sunset that strange vision, severeth<br>
Our memory from itself, and us from <mark4>all</mark4><br>
We sought and yet were baffled." I <mark3>recall</mark3><br>
The sense of what he said, although I <mark4>mar</mark4><br>
The force of his expressions. The broad <mark3>star</mark3><br>
Of day meanwhile had sunk behind the <mark4>hill,</mark4><br>
And the black bell became <mark4>invisible,</mark4><br>
And the red tower look'd gray, and all <mark4>between</mark4><br>
The churches, ships and palaces were <mark1>seen</mark1><br>
Huddled in gloom;?into the purple <mark3>sea</mark3><br>
The orange hues of heaven sunk <mark4>silently.</mark4><br>
We hardly spoke, and soon the <mark1>gondola</mark1><br>
Convey'd me to my lodgings by the <mark1>way.</mark1><br>
<br>
The following morn was rainy, cold and <mark3>dim:</mark3><br>
Ere Maddalo arose, I call'd on <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
And whilst I waited with his child I <mark4>play'd;</mark4><br>
A lovelier toy sweet Nature never <mark1>made,</mark1><br>
A serious, subtle, wild, yet gentle <mark4>being,</mark4><br>
Graceful without design and unforeseeing,<br>
With eyes?Oh speak not of her eyes!?which <mark1>seem</mark1><br>
Twin mirrors of Italian Heaven, yet <mark1>gleam</mark1><br>
With such deep meaning, as we never <mark1>see</mark1><br>
But in the human countenance: with <mark3>me</mark3><br>
She was a special favourite: I had nurs'd<br>
Her fine and feeble limbs when she came <mark4>first</mark4><br>
To this bleak world; and she yet seem'd to <mark3>know</mark3><br>
On second sight her ancient <mark5>playfellow,</mark5><br>
Less chang'd than she was by six months or <mark3>so;</mark3><br>
For after her first shyness was worn <mark4>out</mark4><br>
We sate there, rolling billiard balls <mark3>about,</mark3><br>
When the Count enter'd. Salutations <mark4>past?</mark4><br>
"The word you spoke last night might well have <mark3>cast</mark3><br>
A darkness on my spirit?if man <mark1>be</mark1><br>
The passive thing you say, I should not <mark1>see</mark1><br>
Much harm in the religions and old <mark4>saws</mark4><br>
(Though I may never own such leaden <mark3>laws)</mark3><br>
Which break a teachless nature to the <mark4>yoke:</mark4><br>
Mine is another faith"?thus much I <mark3>spoke</mark3><br>
And noting he replied not, added: <mark2>"See</mark2><br>
This lovely child, blithe, innocent and <mark3>free;</mark3><br>
She spends a happy time with little <mark4>care,</mark4><br>
While we to such sick thoughts subjected <mark4>are</mark4><br>
As came on you last night. It is our <mark4>will</mark4><br>
That thus enchains us to permitted <mark1>ill.</mark1><br>
We might be otherwise. We might be <mark1>all</mark1><br>
We dream of happy, high, majestical.<br>
Where is the love, beauty, and truth we <mark4>seek</mark4><br>
But in our mind? and if we were not <mark3>weak</mark3><br>
Should we be less in deed than in <mark3>desire?"</mark3><br>
"Ay, if we were not weak?and we <mark4>aspire</mark4><br>
How vainly to be strong!" said <mark1>Maddalo:</mark1><br>
"You talk Utopia." "It remains to <mark1>know,"</mark1><br>
I then rejoin'd, "and those who try may <mark4>find</mark4><br>
How strong the chains are which our spirit <mark3>bind;</mark3><br>
Brittle perchance as straw.... We are assur'd<br>
Much may be conquer'd, much may be endur'd,<br>
Of what degrades and crushes us. We <mark1>know</mark1><br>
That we have power over ourselves to <mark1>do</mark1><br>
And suffer?what, we know not till we <mark3>try;</mark3><br>
But something nobler than to live and <mark3>die:</mark3><br>
So taught those kings of old <mark4>philosophy</mark4><br>
Who reign'd, before Religion made men <mark1>blind;</mark1><br>
And those who suffer with their suffering <mark1>kind</mark1><br>
Yet feel their faith, religion." "My dear <mark4>friend,"</mark4><br>
Said Maddalo, "my judgement will not <mark3>bend</mark3><br>
To your opinion, though I think you <mark4>might</mark4><br>
Make such a system <mark3>refutation-tight</mark3><br>
As far as words go. I knew one like <mark3>you</mark3><br>
Who to this city came some months <mark3>ago,</mark3><br>
With whom I argu'd in this sort, and <mark3>he</mark3><br>
Is now gone mad?and so he answer'd <mark1>me?</mark1><br>
Poor fellow! but if you would like to <mark3>go</mark3><br>
We'll visit him, and his wild talk will <mark3>show</mark3><br>
How vain are such aspiring <mark4>theories."</mark4><br>
"I hope to prove the induction <mark4>otherwise,</mark4><br>
And that a want of that true theory, <mark1>still,</mark1><br>
Which seeks a 'soul of goodness' in things <mark1>ill</mark1><br>
Or in himself or <mark4>others</mark4>, has thus <mark4>bow'd</mark4><br>
His being. There are some by nature <mark4>proud,</mark4><br>
Who patient in all else demand but <mark4>this?</mark4><br>
To love and be belov'd with <mark4>gentleness;</mark4><br>
And being scorn'd, what wonder if they <mark1>die</mark1><br>
Some living death? this is not <mark1>destiny</mark1><br>
But man's own wilful <mark1>ill."</mark1><br>
<br>
As thus I <mark1>spoke</mark1><br>
Servants announc'd the gondola, and <mark3>we</mark3><br>
Through the fast-falling rain and high-wrought <mark1>sea</mark1><br>
Sail'd to the island where the madhouse <mark4>stands.</mark4><br>
