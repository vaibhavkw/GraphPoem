Title : The Little White Hearse <br>
Author : Ella Wheeler Wilcox <br><br>

Somebody's baby was buried <mark3>to-day--</mark3><br>
The empty white hearse from the grave rumbled <mark3>back,</mark3><br>
And the morning somehow seemed less smiling and <mark3>gay</mark3><br>
As I paused on the walk while it crossed on its <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
And a shadow seemed drawn o'er the sun's golden <mark3>track.</mark3><br>
<br>
Somebody's baby was laid out to <mark3>rest,</mark3><br>
White as a snowdrop, and fair to <mark3>behold,</mark3><br>
And the soft little hands were crossed over the <mark3>breast,</mark3><br>
And those hands and the lips and the eyelids were <mark3>pressed</mark3><br>
With kisses as hot as the eyelids were <mark3>cold.</mark3><br>
<br>
Somebody saw it go out of her <mark4>sight,</mark4><br>
Under the coffin lid--out through the <mark3>door;</mark3><br>
Somebody finds only darkness and <mark3>blight</mark3><br>
All through the glory of summer-sun <mark3>light;</mark3><br>
Somebody's baby will waken no <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
<br>
Somebody's sorrow is making me <mark3>weep:</mark3><br>
I know not her name, but I echo her <mark3>cry,</mark3><br>
For the dearly bought baby she longed so to <mark3>keep,</mark3><br>
The baby that rode to its long-lasting <mark3>sleep</mark3><br>
In the little white hearse that went rumbling <mark3>by.</mark3><br>
<br>
I know not her name, but her sorrow I <mark3>know;</mark3><br>
While I paused on the crossing I lived it once <mark1>more,</mark1><br>
And back to my heart surged that river of <mark3>woe</mark3><br>
That but in the breast of a mother can <mark3>flow;</mark3><br>
For the little white hearse has been, too, at my <mark1>door.</mark1><br>
