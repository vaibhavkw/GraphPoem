Title : The Landlord's Tale. Paul Revere's Ride <br>
Author : Henry Wadsworth Longfellow <br><br>

Listen, my children, and you shall <mark4>hear</mark4><br>
Of the midnight ride of Paul <mark4>Revere,</mark4><br>
On the eighteenth of April, in <mark4>Seventy-five;</mark4><br>
Hardly a man is now <mark4>alive</mark4><br>
Who remembers that famous day and <mark3>year.</mark3><br>
<br>
He said to his friend, "If the British <mark3>march</mark3><br>
By land or sea from the town <mark3>to-night,</mark3><br>
Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry <mark3>arch</mark3><br>
Of the North Church tower as a signal <mark3>light,--</mark3><br>
One, if by land, and two, if by <mark3>sea;</mark3><br>
And I on the opposite shore will <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
Ready to ride and spread the <mark3>alarm</mark3><br>
Through every Middlesex village and <mark3>farm,</mark3><br>
For the country folk to be up and to <mark3>arm."</mark3><br>
Then he said, "Good night!" and with muffled <mark4>oar</mark4><br>
Silently rowed to the Charlestown <mark3>shore,</mark3><br>
Just as the moon rose over the <mark3>bay,</mark3><br>
Where swinging wide at her moorings <mark3>lay</mark3><br>
The Somerset, British <mark4>man-of-war;</mark4><br>
A phantom ship, with each mast and <mark4>spar</mark4><br>
Across the moon like a prison <mark3>bar,</mark3><br>
And a huge black hulk, that was <mark4>magnified</mark4><br>
By its own reflection in the <mark4>tide.</mark4><br>
<br>
Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and <mark4>street,</mark4><br>
Wanders and watches with eager <mark3>ears,</mark3><br>
Till in the silence around him he <mark3>hears</mark3><br>
The muster of men at the barrack <mark4>door,</mark4><br>
The sound of arms, and the tramp of <mark3>feet,</mark3><br>
And the measured tread of the grenadiers, <br>
Marching down to their boats on the <mark1>shore.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then he climbed the tower of the Old North <mark4>Church,</mark4><br>
By the wooden stairs, with stealthy <mark4>tread,</mark4><br>
To the belfry-chamber <mark3>overhead,</mark3><br>
And startled the pigeons from their <mark3>perch</mark3><br>
On the sombre rafters, that round him <mark4>made</mark4><br>
Masses and moving shapes of shade, <mark3>--</mark3><br>
By the trembling ladder, steep and <mark3>tall,</mark3><br>
To the highest window in the <mark3>wall,</mark3><br>
Where he paused to listen and look <mark3>down</mark3><br>
A moment on the roofs of the <mark3>town,</mark3><br>
And the moonlight flowing over <mark3>all.</mark3><br>
Beneath, in the <mark4>churchyard</mark4>, lay the <mark4>dead,</mark4><br>
In their night-encampment on the <mark4>hill,</mark4><br>
Wrapped in silence so deep and <mark3>still</mark3><br>
That he could hear, like a sentinel's <mark1>tread,</mark1><br>
The watchful night-wind, as it <mark4>went</mark4><br>
Creeping along from tent to <mark3>tent,</mark3><br>
And seeming to whisper, "All is <mark4>well!"</mark4><br>
A moment only he feels the <mark3>spell</mark3><br>
Of the place and the hour, and the secret <mark3>dread</mark3><br>
Of the lonely belfry and the <mark1>dead;</mark1><br>
For suddenly all his thoughts are <mark3>bent</mark3><br>
On a shadowy something far <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
Where the river widens to meet the bay, <mark1>--</mark1><br>
A line of black that bends and <mark3>floats</mark3><br>
On the rising tide, like a bridge of <mark3>boats.</mark3><br>
<br>
Meanwhile, impatient to mount and <mark4>ride,</mark4><br>
Booted and <mark4>spurred</mark4>, with a heavy <mark3>stride</mark3><br>
On the opposite shore walked Paul <mark1>Revere.</mark1><br>
Now he patted his horse's <mark3>side,</mark3><br>
Now gazed at the landscape far and <mark3>near,</mark3><br>
Then, impetuous, stamped the <mark5>earth,</mark5><br>
And turned and tightened his saddle <mark3>girth;</mark3><br>
But mostly he watched with eager <mark3>search</mark3><br>
The belfry-tower of the Old North <mark1>Church,</mark1><br>
As it rose above the graves on the <mark1>hill,</mark1><br>
Lonely and spectral and sombre and <mark1>still.</mark1><br>
And lo! as he looks, on the belfry's <mark4>height</mark4><br>
A glimmer, and then a gleam of <mark1>light!</mark1><br>
He springs to the saddle, the bridle he <mark4>turns,</mark4><br>
But lingers and gazes, till full on his <mark3>sight</mark3><br>
A second lamp in the belfry <mark3>burns!</mark3><br>
A hurry of hoofs in a village <mark1>street,</mark1><br>
A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the <mark3>dark,</mark3><br>
And beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a <mark3>spark</mark3><br>
Struck out by a steed flying fearless and <mark3>fleet:</mark3><br>
That was all! And <mark4>yet</mark4>, through the gloom and the <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
The fate of a nation was riding that <mark3>night;</mark3><br>
And the spark struck out by that steed, in his <mark3>flight,</mark3><br>
Kindled the land into flame with its <mark4>heat.</mark4><br>
He has left the village and mounted the <mark3>steep,</mark3><br>
And beneath him, tranquil and broad and <mark3>deep,</mark3><br>
Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean <mark4>tides;</mark4><br>
And under the alders, that skirt its <mark3>edge,</mark3><br>
Now soft on the sand, now loud on the <mark3>ledge,</mark3><br>
Is heard the tramp of his steed as he <mark3>rides.</mark3><br>
<br>
It was twelve by the village <mark4>clock,</mark4><br>
When he crossed the bridge into Medford <mark1>town.</mark1><br>
He heard the crowing of the <mark3>cock,</mark3><br>
And the barking of the farmer's <mark3>dog,</mark3><br>
And felt the damp of the river <mark3>fog,</mark3><br>
That rises after the sun goes <mark1>down.</mark1><br>
<br>
It was one by the village <mark1>clock,</mark1><br>
When he galloped into <mark4>Lexington.</mark4><br>
He saw the gilded weathercock <br>
Swim in the moonlight as he <mark4>passed,</mark4><br>
And the meeting-house windows, blank and <mark4>bare,</mark4><br>
Gaze at him with a spectral <mark3>glare,</mark3><br>
As if they already stood <mark3>aghast</mark3><br>
At the bloody work they would look <mark4>upon.</mark4><br>
<br>
It was two by the village <mark1>clock,</mark1><br>
When he came to the bridge in Concord <mark1>town.</mark1><br>
He heard the bleating of the <mark3>flock,</mark3><br>
And the twitter of birds among the <mark4>trees,</mark4><br>
And felt the breath of the morning <mark3>breeze</mark3><br>
Blowing over the meadows <mark3>brown.</mark3><br>
And one was safe and asleep in his <mark4>bed</mark4><br>
Who at the bridge would be first to <mark4>fall,</mark4><br>
Who that day would be lying <mark1>dead,</mark1><br>
Pierced by a British <mark3>musket-ball.</mark3><br>
<br>
You know the rest. In the books you have <mark3>read,</mark3><br>
How the British Regulars fired and fled, <mark3>--</mark3><br>
How the farmers gave them ball for <mark3>ball,</mark3><br>
From behind each fence and farm-yard <mark1>wall,</mark1><br>
Chasing the red-coats down the <mark4>lane,</mark4><br>
Then crossing the fields to emerge <mark3>again</mark3><br>
Under the trees at the turn of the <mark4>road,</mark4><br>
And only pausing to fire and <mark3>load.</mark3><br>
<br>
So through the night rode Paul <mark1>Revere;</mark1><br>
And so through the night went his cry of <mark1>alarm</mark1><br>
To every Middlesex village and farm, <mark1>--</mark1><br>
A cry of defiance and not of <mark3>fear,</mark3><br>
A voice in the darkness, a knock at the <mark1>door,</mark1><br>
And a word that shall echo forevermore! <br>
For, borne on the night-wind of the <mark3>Past,</mark3><br>
Through all our history, to the <mark3>last,</mark3><br>
In the hour of darkness and peril and <mark4>need,</mark4><br>
The people will waken and listen to <mark1>hear</mark1><br>
The hurrying hoof-beats of that <mark3>steed,</mark3><br>
And the midnight message of Paul <mark1>Revere.</mark1><br>
