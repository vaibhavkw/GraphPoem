Title : The Affliction of Richard <br>
Author : Robert Bridges <br><br>

      Love not too much. But how,<br>
When thou hast made me <mark3>such,</mark3><br>
And dost thy gifts bestow,<br>
How can I love too <mark3>much?</mark3><br>
Though I must fear to <mark3>lose,</mark3><br>
And drown my joy in <mark3>care,</mark3><br>
With all its thorns I <mark3>choose</mark3><br>
The path of love and <mark3>prayer.</mark3><br>
<br>
Though thou, I know not <mark3>why,</mark3><br>
Didst kill my childish <mark3>trust,</mark3><br>
That breach with toil did <mark3>I</mark3><br>
Repair, because I <mark3>must:</mark3><br>
And spite of frighting <mark4>schemes,</mark4><br>
With which the fiends of <mark3>Hell</mark3><br>
Blaspheme thee in my <mark3>dreams,</mark3><br>
So far I have hoped <mark3>well.</mark3><br>
<br>
But what the heavenly <mark3>key,</mark3><br>
What marvel in me <mark4>wrought</mark4><br>
Shall quite exculpate <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
I have no shadow of <mark3>thought.</mark3><br>
What am I that <mark4>complain?</mark4><br>
The love, from which <mark4>began</mark4><br>
My question sad and <mark4>vain,</mark4><br>
Justifies thee to <mark4>man.</mark4><br>
