Title : One Home <br>
Author : William E. Stafford <br><br>

Mine was a Midwest home--you can keep your <mark4>world.</mark4><br>
Plain black hats rode the thoughts that made our <mark4>code.</mark4><br>
We sang hymns in the house; the roof was near <mark4>God.</mark4><br>
<br>
The light bulb that hung in the pantry made a wan <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
but we could read by it the names of <mark4>preserves--</mark4><br>
outside, the buffalo grass, and the wind in the <mark3>night.</mark3><br>
<br>
A wildcat sprang at Grandpa on the Fourth of <mark3>July</mark3><br>
when he was cutting plum bushes for fuel, <br>
before Indians pulled the West over the edge of the <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
<br>
To anyone who looked at us we <mark4>said</mark4>, "My <mark4>friend";</mark4><br>
liking the cut of a thought, we could say "Hello." <br>
(But plain black hats rode the thoughts that made our <mark1>code.)</mark1><br>
<br>
The sun was over our town; it was like a <mark4>blade.</mark4><br>
Kicking cottonwood leaves we ran toward <mark4>storms.</mark4><br>
Wherever we looked the land would hold us up.<br>
