Title : Faesulan Idyl <br>
Author : Walter Savage Landor <br><br>

Here, where precipitate Spring with one light <mark4>bound</mark4><br>
Into hot Summer's lusty arms <mark4>expires;</mark4><br>
And where go forth at morn, at eve, at <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
Soft airs, that want the lute to play with them,<br>
And softer sighs, that know not what they <mark4>want;</mark4><br>
Under a wall, beneath an <mark3>orange-tree</mark3><br>
Whose tallest flowers could tell the lowlier <mark4>ones</mark4><br>
Of sights in Fiesole right up <mark3>above,</mark3><br>
While I was gazing a few paces off<br>
At what they seemed to show me with their <mark4>nods,</mark4><br>
Their frequent whispers and their pointing <mark4>shoots,</mark4><br>
A gentle maid came down the <mark4>garden-steps</mark4><br>
And gathered the pure treasure in her <mark4>lap.</mark4><br>
I heard the branches rustle, and stept <mark1>forth</mark1><br>
To drive the ox away, or mule, or <mark4>goat,</mark4><br>
(Such I believed it must be); for sweet <mark4>scents</mark4><br>
Are the swift vehicles of still sweeter <mark4>thoughts,</mark4><br>
And nurse and pillow the dull memory<br>
That would let drop without them her best <mark4>stores.</mark4><br>
They bring me tales of youth and tones of <mark3>love,</mark3><br>
And 'tis and ever was my wish and way<br>
To let all flowers live freely, and all die,<br>
Whene'er their Genius bids their souls <mark4>depart,</mark4><br>
Among their kindred in their native <mark4>place.</mark4><br>
I never pluck the rose; the violet's <mark4>head</mark4><br>
Hath shaken with my breath upon its <mark4>bank</mark4><br>
And not reproacht me; the ever-sacred <mark4>cup</mark4><br>
Of the pure lily hath between my <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
Felt safe, unsoil'd, nor lost one grain of <mark4>gold.</mark4><br>
I saw the light that made the glossy <mark4>leaves</mark4><br>
More glossy; the fair arm, the fairer <mark4>cheek</mark4><br>
Warmed by the eye intent on its <mark4>pursuit;</mark4><br>
I saw the foot, <mark4>that</mark4>, altho <mark4>half-erect</mark4><br>
From its grey slipper, could not lift her <mark3>up</mark3><br>
To what she wanted: I held down a <mark4>branch</mark4><br>
And gather'd her some blossoms, since their <mark4>hour</mark4><br>
Was come, and bees had wounded them, and <mark4>flies</mark4><br>
Of harder wing were working their way thro<br>
And scattering them in fragments under <mark4>foot.</mark4><br>
So crisp were some, they rattled unevolved,<br>
Others, ere broken off, fell into <mark4>shells,</mark4><br>
For such appear the petals when detacht,<br>
Unbending, brittle, lucid, white like <mark3>snow,</mark3><br>
And like snow not seen thro, by eye or <mark4>sun:</mark4><br>
Yet every one her gown received from <mark3>me</mark3><br>
Was fairer than the first . . I thought not <mark3>so,</mark3><br>
But so she praised them to reward my <mark4>care.</mark4><br>
I said: you find the <mark4>largest.</mark4><br>
<br>
This <mark4>indeed,</mark4><br>
Cried she, is large and <mark4>sweet.</mark4><br>
<br>
She held one <mark1>forth,</mark1><br>
Whether for me to look at or to <mark4>take</mark4><br>
She knew not, nor did I; but taking <mark4>it</mark4><br>
Would best have solved (and this she felt) her <mark4>doubts.</mark4><br>
I dared not touch <mark4>it</mark4>, for it seemed a <mark4>part</mark4><br>
Of her own self; fresh, full, the most <mark4>mature</mark4><br>
Of blossoms, yet a blossom; with a <mark4>touch</mark4><br>
To fall, and yet unfallen.<br>
<br>
She drew <mark4>back</mark4><br>
The boon she tendered, and then, finding <mark4>not</mark4><br>
The ribbon at her waist to fix it <mark4>in,</mark4><br>
Dropt <mark4>it</mark4>, as loth to drop it, on the <mark4>rest.</mark4><br>
