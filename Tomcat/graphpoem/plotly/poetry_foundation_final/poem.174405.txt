Title : The Question <br>
Author : Percy Bysshe Shelley <br><br>

I dreamed that, as I wandered by the <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
Bare Winter suddenly was changed to <mark4>Spring,</mark4><br>
And gentle odours led my steps <mark3>astray,</mark3><br>
Mixed with a sound of waters <mark4>murmuring</mark4><br>
Along a shelving bank of turf, which <mark3>lay</mark3><br>
Under a copse, and hardly dared to <mark4>fling</mark4><br>
Its green arms round the bosom of the <mark3>stream,</mark3><br>
But kissed it and then fled, as thou mightest in <mark3>dream.</mark3><br>
<br>
There grew pied wind-flowers and <mark4>violets,</mark4><br>
Daisies, those pearled Arcturi of the <mark3>earth,</mark3><br>
The constellated flower that never <mark4>sets;</mark4><br>
Faint oxlips; tender bluebells, at whose <mark3>birth</mark3><br>
The sod scarce heaved; and that tall flower that wets?<br>
Like a child, half in tenderness and <mark3>mirth?</mark3><br>
Its mother's face with Heaven's collected <mark4>tears,</mark4><br>
When the low wind, its playmate's voice, it <mark4>hears.</mark4><br>
<br>
And in the warm hedge grew lush <mark4>eglantine,</mark4><br>
Green cowbind and the moonlight-coloured <mark3>may,</mark3><br>
And cherry-blossoms, and white cups, whose <mark4>wine</mark4><br>
Was the bright dew, yet drained not by the <mark3>day;</mark3><br>
And wild roses, and ivy <mark4>serpentine,</mark4><br>
With its dark buds and leaves, wandering <mark1>astray;</mark1><br>
And flowers azure, black, and streaked with <mark3>gold,</mark3><br>
Fairer than any wakened eyes <mark3>behold.</mark3><br>
<br>
And nearer to the river's trembling <mark3>edge</mark3><br>
There grew broad flag-flowers, purple pranked with <mark3>white,</mark3><br>
And starry river buds among the <mark3>sedge,</mark3><br>
And floating water-lilies, broad and <mark3>bright,</mark3><br>
Which lit the oak that overhung the <mark3>hedge</mark3><br>
With moonlight beams of their own watery <mark3>light;</mark3><br>
And bulrushes, and reeds of such deep <mark4>green</mark4><br>
As soothed the dazzled eye with sober <mark3>sheen.</mark3><br>
<br>
Methought that of these visionary <mark4>flowers</mark4><br>
I made a nosegay, bound in such a <mark1>way</mark1><br>
That the same <mark4>hues</mark4>, which in their natural <mark3>bowers</mark3><br>
Were mingled or opposed, the like <mark3>array</mark3><br>
Kept these imprisoned children of the <mark3>Hours</mark3><br>
Within my hand,?and then, elate and <mark3>gay,</mark3><br>
I hastened to the spot whence I had <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
That I might there present it!?Oh! to <mark4>whom?</mark4><br>
