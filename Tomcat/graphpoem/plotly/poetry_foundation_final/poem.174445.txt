Title : The Battle of Blenheim <br>
Author : Robert Southey <br><br>

<br>
It was a summer <mark4>evening,</mark4><br>
Old Kaspar's work was <mark3>done,</mark3><br>
And he before his cottage <mark3>door</mark3><br>
Was sitting in the <mark3>sun,</mark3><br>
And by him sported on the <mark4>green</mark4><br>
His little grandchild <mark4>Wilhelmine.</mark4><br>
<br>
She saw her brother <mark4>Peterkin</mark4><br>
Roll something large and <mark3>round,</mark3><br>
Which he beside the rivulet<br>
In playing there had <mark3>found;</mark3><br>
He came to ask what he had <mark1>found,</mark1><br>
That was so large, and smooth, and <mark1>round.</mark1><br>
<br>
Old Kaspar took it from the boy,<br>
Who stood expectant <mark3>by;</mark3><br>
And then the old man shook his <mark4>head,</mark4><br>
And, with a natural <mark3>sigh,</mark3><br>
"'Tis some poor fellow's skull," said <mark1>he,</mark1><br>
"Who fell in the great <mark1>victory.</mark1><br>
<br>
"I find them in the <mark4>garden,</mark4><br>
For there's many here <mark3>about;</mark3><br>
And often when I go to plough,<br>
The ploughshare turns them <mark3>out!</mark3><br>
For many thousand men," said <mark1>he,</mark1><br>
"Were slain in that great <mark1>victory."</mark1><br>
<br>
"Now tell us what 'twas all <mark1>about,"</mark1><br>
Young Peterkin, he <mark3>cries;</mark3><br>
And little Wilhelmine looks up<br>
With wonder-waiting <mark3>eyes;</mark3><br>
"Now tell us all about the <mark3>war,</mark3><br>
And what they fought each other <mark3>for."</mark3><br>
<br>
"It was the English," Kaspar <mark4>cried,</mark4><br>
"Who put the French to <mark3>rout;</mark3><br>
But what they fought each other <mark1>for,</mark1><br>
I could not well make <mark1>out;</mark1><br>
But everybody said," quoth <mark1>he,</mark1><br>
"That 'twas a famous <mark1>victory.</mark1><br>
<br>
"My father lived at Blenheim <mark4>then,</mark4><br>
Yon little stream hard <mark1>by;</mark1><br>
They burnt his dwelling to the <mark4>ground,</mark4><br>
And he was forced to <mark3>fly;</mark3><br>
So with his wife and child he <mark4>fled,</mark4><br>
Nor had he where to rest his <mark1>head.</mark1><br>
<br>
"With fire and sword the country <mark1>round</mark1><br>
Was wasted far and <mark4>wide,</mark4><br>
And many a childing mother <mark1>then,</mark1><br>
And new-born baby <mark3>died;</mark3><br>
But things like that, you know, must <mark4>be</mark4><br>
At every famous <mark1>victory.</mark1><br>
<br>
"They say it was a shocking <mark4>sight</mark4><br>
After the field was <mark4>won;</mark4><br>
For many thousand bodies <mark4>here</mark4><br>
Lay rotting in the <mark1>sun;</mark1><br>
But things like that, you know, must <mark1>be</mark1><br>
After a famous <mark1>victory.</mark1><br>
<br>
"Great praise the Duke of Marlbro' <mark1>won,</mark1><br>
And our good Prince <mark4>Eugene."</mark4><br>
"Why, 'twas a very wicked <mark4>thing!"</mark4><br>
Said little <mark1>Wilhelmine.</mark1><br>
"Nay... nay... my little girl," quoth <mark1>he,</mark1><br>
"It was a famous <mark1>victory.</mark1><br>
<br>
"And everybody praised the Duke<br>
Who this great fight did <mark4>win."</mark4><br>
"But what good came of it at <mark4>last?"</mark4><br>
Quoth little <mark1>Peterkin.</mark1><br>
"Why that I cannot tell," said <mark1>he,</mark1><br>
"But 'twas a famous <mark1>victory."</mark1><br>
