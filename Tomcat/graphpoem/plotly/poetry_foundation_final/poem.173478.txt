Title : Preludes <br>
Author : T. S. Eliot <br><br>

<br>
The winter evening settles <mark4>down</mark4><br>
With smell of steaks in passageways. <br>
Six <mark4>o'clock.</mark4><br>
The burnt-out ends of smoky <mark4>days.</mark4><br>
And now a gusty shower <mark3>wraps</mark3><br>
The grimy <mark3>scraps</mark3><br>
Of withered leaves about your <mark3>feet</mark3><br>
And newspapers from vacant <mark4>lots;</mark4><br>
The showers <mark3>beat</mark3><br>
On broken blinds and <mark3>chimney-pots,</mark3><br>
And at the corner of the <mark3>street</mark3><br>
A lonely cab-horse steams and <mark4>stamps.</mark4><br>
<br>
And then the lighting of the <mark3>lamps.</mark3><br>
<br>
The morning comes to <mark4>consciousness</mark4><br>
Of faint stale smells of <mark4>beer</mark4><br>
From the sawdust-trampled <mark1>street</mark1><br>
With all its muddy feet that <mark4>press</mark4><br>
To early <mark4>coffee-stands.</mark4><br>
With the other masquerades <br>
That time <mark4>resumes,</mark4><br>
One thinks of all the <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
That are raising dingy <mark4>shades</mark4><br>
In a thousand furnished <mark4>rooms.</mark4><br>
You tossed a blanket from the <mark4>bed,</mark4><br>
<br>
You lay upon your back, and <mark4>waited;</mark4><br>
You dozed, and watched the night <mark3>revealing</mark3><br>
The thousand sordid <mark4>images</mark4><br>
Of which your soul was <mark4>constituted;</mark4><br>
They flickered against the <mark3>ceiling.</mark3><br>
And when all the world came <mark4>back</mark4><br>
And the light crept up between the <mark4>shutters</mark4><br>
And you heard the sparrows in the <mark3>gutters,</mark3><br>
You had such a vision of the <mark1>street</mark1><br>
As the street hardly <mark4>understands;</mark4><br>
Sitting along the bed's edge, <mark4>where</mark4><br>
You curled the papers from your <mark3>hair,</mark3><br>
Or clasped the yellow soles of <mark1>feet</mark1><br>
In the palms of both soiled <mark1>hands.</mark1><br>
His soul stretched tight across the <mark4>skies</mark4><br>
That fade behind a city <mark4>block,</mark4><br>
<br>
Or trampled by insistent <mark1>feet</mark1><br>
At four and five and six <mark1>o'clock;</mark1><br>
And short square fingers stuffing <mark4>pipes,</mark4><br>
And evening <mark4>newspapers</mark4>, and <mark3>eyes</mark3><br>
Assured of certain <mark4>certainties,</mark4><br>
The conscience of a blackened <mark1>street</mark1><br>
Impatient to assume the <mark4>world.</mark4><br>
I am moved by fancies that are <mark3>curled</mark3><br>
Around these images, and <mark4>cling:</mark4><br>
The notion of some infinitely gentle <br>
<br>
Infinitely suffering <mark3>thing.</mark3><br>
Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh; <br>
The worlds revolve like ancient <mark4>women</mark4><br>
Gathering fuel in vacant <mark1>lots.</mark1><br>
