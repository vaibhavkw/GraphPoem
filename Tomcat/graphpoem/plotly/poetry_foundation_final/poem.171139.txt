Title : Love Like Salt <br>
Author : Lisel Mueller <br><br>

It lies in our hands in <mark4>crystals</mark4><br>
too intricate to decipher <br>
<br>
It goes into the <mark4>skillet</mark4><br>
without being given a second <mark4>thought</mark4><br>
<br>
It spills on the floor so fine <br>
we step all over <mark4>it</mark4><br>
<br>
We carry a pinch behind each <mark4>eyeball</mark4><br>
<br>
It breaks out on our <mark4>foreheads</mark4><br>
<br>
We store it inside our <mark4>bodies</mark4><br>
in secret wineskins <br>
<br>
At supper, we pass it around the <mark4>table</mark4><br>
talking of holidays and the sea.<br>
