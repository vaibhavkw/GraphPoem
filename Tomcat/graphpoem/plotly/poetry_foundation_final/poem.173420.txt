Title : Idea 20: An evil spirit, your beauty, haunts me still <br>
Author : Michael Drayton <br><br>

<br>
An evil spirit, your beauty, haunts me <mark3>still,</mark3><br>
Wherewith, alas, I have been long <mark4>possess'd,</mark4><br>
Which ceaseth not to tempt me to each <mark3>ill,</mark3><br>
Nor gives me once but one poor minute's rest.<br>
In me it speaks, whether I sleep or <mark3>wake;</mark3><br>
And when by means to drive it out I try,<br>
With greater torments then it me doth <mark3>take,</mark3><br>
And tortures me in most extremity.<br>
Before my face it lays down my <mark4>despairs,</mark4><br>
And hastes me on unto a sudden <mark3>death;</mark3><br>
Now tempting me to drown myself in <mark3>tears,</mark3><br>
And then in sighing to give up my <mark3>breath.</mark3><br>
Thus am I still provok'd to every <mark4>evil</mark4><br>
By this good-wicked spirit, sweet <mark4>angel-devil.</mark4><br>
