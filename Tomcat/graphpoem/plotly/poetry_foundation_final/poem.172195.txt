Title : John Lennon <br>
Author : Mary Jo Salter <br><br>

The music was already turning <mark4>sad,</mark4><br>
those fresh-faced voices singing in a <mark4>round</mark4><br>
the lie that time could set its needle <mark4>back</mark4><br>
<br>
and play from the beginning. Had you <mark4>lived</mark4><br>
to eighty, as you'd <mark4>wished</mark4>, who knows?--you <mark4>might</mark4><br>
have broken from the circle of that <mark4>past</mark4><br>
<br>
more ours than yours. Never even <mark4>sure</mark4><br>
which was the truest color for your <mark4>hair</mark4><br>
(it changed with each photographer), we <mark4>claimed</mark4><br>
<br>
you for ourselves; called you John and <mark3>named</mark3><br>
the day you left us (spun out like a <mark4>reel--</mark4><br>
the last broadcast to prove you'd lived at <mark4>all)</mark4><br>
<br>
an end to hope itself. It isn't <mark3>true,</mark3><br>
and worse, does you no justice if we <mark3>call</mark3><br>
your death the death of anything but <mark3>you.</mark3><br>
<br>
It put you in the headlines once <mark4>again:</mark4><br>
<br>
years after you'd left the <mark4>band</mark4>, you <mark4>joined</mark4><br>
another--of those whose lives, in breaking, <mark4>link</mark4><br>
all memory with their end. The studio   <br>
      of history can tamper with you now, <br>
<br>
as if there'd always been a single <mark4>track</mark4><br>
chance traveled on, and your discordant <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
had led us to the final <mark4>violence.</mark4><br>
<br>
Yet like the times when I, a star-crossed <mark4>fan,</mark4><br>
had catalogued your favorite <mark4>foods</mark4>, your <mark4>views</mark4><br>
on monarchy and war, and gaily <mark4>clipped</mark4><br>
<br>
your quips and daily antics from the <mark3>news,</mark3><br>
I keep a loving record of your death.   <br>
All the evidence is in--of <mark4>what,</mark4><br>
<br>
and to what end, it's hard to figure <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
riddles you might have beat into a song.   <br>
A younger face of yours, a cover <mark4>shot,</mark4><br>
<br>
            peered from all the newsstands as if proof <br>
of some noteworthy thing you'd newly <mark4>done.</mark4><br>
