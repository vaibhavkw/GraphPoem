Title : Lapis Lazuli <br>
Author : William Butler Yeats <br><br>

(for Harry <mark4>Clifton)</mark4><br>
I have heard that hysterical women <mark3>say</mark3><br>
They are sick of the palette and <mark3>fiddle-bow,</mark3><br>
Of poets that are always <mark3>gay,</mark3><br>
For everybody knows or else should <mark3>know</mark3><br>
That if nothing drastic is <mark4>done</mark4><br>
Aeroplane and Zeppelin will come <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
Pitch like King Billy bomb-balls <mark4>in</mark4><br>
Until the town lie beaten <mark4>flat.</mark4><br>
<br>
All perform their tragic <mark3>play,</mark3><br>
There struts Hamlet, there is <mark4>Lear,</mark4><br>
That's <mark4>Ophelia</mark4>, that <mark4>Cordelia;</mark4><br>
Yet they, should the last scene be <mark4>there,</mark4><br>
The great stage curtain about to <mark4>drop,</mark4><br>
If worthy their prominent part in the <mark1>play,</mark1><br>
Do not break up their lines to <mark4>weep.</mark4><br>
They know that Hamlet and Lear are <mark1>gay;</mark1><br>
Gaiety transfiguring all that <mark3>dread.</mark3><br>
All men have aimed <mark4>at</mark4>, found and <mark4>lost;</mark4><br>
Black out; Heaven blazing into the <mark3>head:</mark3><br>
Tragedy wrought to its uttermost. <br>
Though Hamlet rambles and Lear <mark3>rages,</mark3><br>
And all the drop scenes drop at <mark4>once</mark4><br>
Upon a hundred thousand <mark3>stages,</mark3><br>
It cannot grow by an inch or an <mark4>ounce.</mark4><br>
<br>
On their own feet they came, or on <mark4>shipboard,</mark4><br>
Camel-back, horse-back, <mark3>ass-back</mark3>, <mark3>mule-back,</mark3><br>
Old civilisations put to the <mark4>sword.</mark4><br>
Then they and their wisdom went to <mark3>rack:</mark3><br>
No handiwork of Callimachus <br>
Who handled marble as if it were <mark4>bronze,</mark4><br>
Made draperies that seemed to <mark4>rise</mark4><br>
When sea-wind swept the corner, <mark4>stands;</mark4><br>
His long lamp chimney shaped like the stem <br>
Of a slender palm, stood but a <mark3>day;</mark3><br>
All things fall and are built <mark4>again</mark4><br>
And those that build them again are <mark1>gay.</mark1><br>
<br>
Two Chinamen, behind them a <mark4>third,</mark4><br>
Are carved in Lapis <mark4>Lazuli,</mark4><br>
Over them flies a long-legged <mark3>bird</mark3><br>
A symbol of <mark4>longevity;</mark4><br>
The third, doubtless a <mark4>serving-man,</mark4><br>
Carries a musical <mark4>instrument.</mark4><br>
<br>
Every discolouration of the <mark4>stone,</mark4><br>
Every accidental crack or <mark4>dent</mark4><br>
Seems a water-course or an <mark4>avalanche,</mark4><br>
Or lofty slope where it still <mark4>snows</mark4><br>
Though doubtless plum or <mark4>cherry-branch</mark4><br>
Sweetens the little half-way <mark4>house</mark4><br>
Those Chinamen climb towards, and <mark3>I</mark3><br>
Delight to imagine them seated <mark1>there;</mark1><br>
There, on the mountain and the <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
On all the tragic scene they <mark3>stare.</mark3><br>
One asks for mournful <mark4>melodies;</mark4><br>
Accomplished fingers begin to <mark1>play.</mark1><br>
Their eyes mid many <mark4>wrinkles</mark4>, their <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
Their ancient, glittering eyes, are <mark1>gay.</mark1><br>
