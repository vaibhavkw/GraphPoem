Title : Locksley Hall <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

Comrades, leave me here a little, while as yet 't is early <mark3>morn:</mark3><br>
Leave me here, and when you want me, sound upon the <mark3>bugle-horn.</mark3><br>
<br>
'T is the place, and all around it, as of old, the curlews <mark3>call,</mark3><br>
Dreary gleams about the moorland flying over Locksley <mark3>Hall;</mark3><br>
<br>
Locksley Hall, that in the distance overlooks the sandy <mark4>tracts,</mark4><br>
And the hollow ocean-ridges roaring into <mark4>cataracts.</mark4><br>
<br>
Many a night from yonder ivied casement, ere I went to <mark3>rest,</mark3><br>
Did I look on great Orion sloping slowly to the <mark3>West.</mark3><br>
<br>
Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising thro' the mellow <mark3>shade,</mark3><br>
Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver <mark3>braid.</mark3><br>
<br>
Here about the beach I wander'd, nourishing a youth <mark3>sublime</mark3><br>
With the fairy tales of science, and the long result of <mark3>Time;</mark3><br>
<br>
When the centuries behind me like a fruitful land reposed;<br>
When I clung to all the present for the promise that it <mark4>closed:</mark4><br>
<br>
When I dipt into the future far as human eye could <mark3>see;</mark3><br>
Saw the Vision of the world and all the wonder that would <mark3>be.?</mark3><br>
<br>
In the Spring a fuller crimson comes upon the robin's <mark3>breast;</mark3><br>
In the Spring the wanton lapwing gets himself another <mark3>crest;</mark3><br>
<br>
In the Spring a livelier iris changes on the burnish'd <mark3>dove;</mark3><br>
In the Spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of <mark3>love.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then her cheek was pale and thinner than should be for one so <mark3>young,</mark3><br>
And her eyes on all my motions with a mute observance <mark3>hung.</mark3><br>
<br>
And I said, "My cousin Amy, speak, and speak the truth to <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
Trust me, cousin, all the current of my being sets to <mark3>thee."</mark3><br>
<br>
On her pallid cheek and forehead came a colour and a <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
As I have seen the rosy red flushing in the northern <mark3>night.</mark3><br>
<br>
And she turn'd?her bosom shaken with a sudden storm of <mark3>sighs?</mark3><br>
All the spirit deeply dawning in the dark of hazel <mark3>eyes?</mark3><br>
<br>
Saying, "I have hid my feelings, fearing they should do me <mark4>wrong";</mark4><br>
Saying, "Dost thou love me, cousin?" <mark4>weeping</mark4>, "I have loved thee <mark3>long."</mark3><br>
<br>
Love took up the glass of Time, and turn'd it in his glowing <mark4>hands;</mark4><br>
Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden <mark3>sands.</mark3><br>
<br>
Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all the chords with <mark3>might;</mark3><br>
Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, pass'd in music out of <mark3>sight.</mark3><br>
<br>
Many a morning on the moorland did we hear the copses <mark4>ring,</mark4><br>
And her whisper throng'd my pulses with the fulness of the <mark3>Spring.</mark3><br>
<br>
Many an evening by the waters did we watch the stately <mark4>ships,</mark4><br>
And our spirits rush'd together at the touching of the <mark3>lips.</mark3><br>
<br>
O my cousin, shallow-hearted! O my Amy, mine no <mark5>more!</mark5><br>
O the dreary, dreary moorland! O the barren, barren <mark3>shore!</mark3><br>
<br>
Falser than all fancy fathoms, falser than all songs have <mark4>sung,</mark4><br>
Puppet to a father's threat, and servile to a shrewish <mark3>tongue!</mark3><br>
<br>
Is it well to wish thee happy??having known me?to <mark4>decline</mark4><br>
On a range of lower feelings and a narrower heart than <mark3>mine!</mark3><br>
<br>
Yet it shall be; thou shalt lower to his level day by <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
What is fine within thee growing coarse to sympathize with <mark3>clay.</mark3><br>
<br>
As the husband is, the wife is: thou art mated with a <mark4>clown,</mark4><br>
And the grossness of his nature will have weight to drag thee <mark3>down.</mark3><br>
<br>
He will hold thee, when his passion shall have spent its novel <mark4>force,</mark4><br>
Something better than his dog, a little dearer than his <mark3>horse.</mark3><br>
<br>
What is this? his eyes are heavy; think not they are glazed with <mark4>wine.</mark4><br>
Go to him, it is thy duty, kiss him, take his hand in <mark3>thine.</mark3><br>
<br>
It may be my lord is weary, that his brain is <mark4>overwrought:</mark4><br>
Soothe him with thy finer fancies, touch him with thy lighter <mark3>thought.</mark3><br>
<br>
He will answer to the purpose, easy things to <mark4>understand?</mark4><br>
Better thou wert dead before me, tho' I slew thee with my <mark3>hand!</mark3><br>
<br>
Better thou and I were lying, hidden from the heart's <mark4>disgrace,</mark4><br>
Roll'd in one another's arms, and silent in a last <mark3>embrace.</mark3><br>
<br>
Cursed be the social wants that sin against the strength of <mark5>youth!</mark5><br>
Cursed be the social lies that warp us from the living <mark3>truth!</mark3><br>
<br>
Cursed be the sickly forms that err from honest Nature's <mark4>rule!</mark4><br>
Cursed be the gold that gilds the straiten'd forehead of the <mark3>fool!</mark3><br>
<br>
Well?'t is well that I should bluster!?Hadst thou less unworthy <mark4>proved?</mark4><br>
Would to God?for I had loved thee more than ever wife was <mark4>loved.</mark4><br>
<br>
Am I mad, that I should cherish that which bears but bitter <mark4>fruit?</mark4><br>
I will pluck it from my bosom, tho' my heart be at the <mark3>root.</mark3><br>
<br>
Never, tho' my mortal summers to such length of years should <mark4>come</mark4><br>
As the many-winter'd crow that leads the clanging rookery <mark4>home.</mark4><br>
<br>
Where is comfort? in division of the records of the <mark4>mind?</mark4><br>
Can I part her from herself, and love her, as I knew her, <mark3>kind?</mark3><br>
<br>
I remember one that perish'd; sweetly did she speak and <mark4>move;</mark4><br>
Such a one do I remember, whom to look at was to <mark1>love.</mark1><br>
<br>
Can I think of her as dead, and love her for the love she <mark3>bore?</mark3><br>
No?she never loved me truly; love is love for <mark4>evermore.</mark4><br>
<br>
Comfort? comfort scorn'd of devils! this is truth the poet <mark4>sings,</mark4><br>
That a sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier <mark3>things.</mark3><br>
<br>
Drug thy memories, lest thou learn it, lest thy heart be put to <mark5>proof,</mark5><br>
In the dead unhappy night, and when the rain is on the <mark3>roof.</mark3><br>
<br>
Like a dog, he hunts in dreams, and thou art staring at the <mark4>wall,</mark4><br>
Where the dying night-lamp flickers, and the shadows rise and <mark3>fall.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then a hand shall pass before thee, pointing to his drunken <mark3>sleep,</mark3><br>
To thy widow'd marriage-pillows, to the tears that thou wilt <mark3>weep.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thou shalt hear the "Never, never," whisper'd by the phantom <mark4>years,</mark4><br>
And a song from out the distance in the ringing of thine <mark3>ears;</mark3><br>
<br>
And an eye shall vex thee, looking ancient kindness on thy <mark4>pain.</mark4><br>
Turn thee, turn thee on thy pillow; get thee to thy rest <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
<br>
Nay, but Nature brings thee solace; for a tender voice will <mark3>cry.</mark3><br>
'T is a purer life than thine, a lip to drain thy trouble <mark3>dry.</mark3><br>
<br>
Baby lips will laugh me down; my latest rival brings thee <mark1>rest.</mark1><br>
Baby fingers, waxen touches, press me from the mother's <mark1>breast.</mark1><br>
<br>
O, the child too clothes the father with a dearness not his <mark3>due.</mark3><br>
Half is thine and half is his: it will be worthy of the <mark3>two.</mark3><br>
<br>
O, I see thee old and formal, fitted to thy petty <mark4>part,</mark4><br>
With a little hoard of maxims preaching down a daughter's <mark3>heart.</mark3><br>
<br>
"They were dangerous guides the feelings?she herself was not <mark4>exempt?</mark4><br>
Truly, she herself had suffer'd"?Perish in thy <mark3>self-contempt!</mark3><br>
<br>
Overlive it?lower yet?be happy! wherefore should I <mark4>care?</mark4><br>
I myself must mix with action, lest I wither by <mark3>despair.</mark3><br>
<br>
What is that which I should turn to, lighting upon days like <mark4>these?</mark4><br>
Every door is barr'd with gold, and opens but to golden <mark3>keys.</mark3><br>
<br>
Every gate is throng'd with suitors, all the markets <mark5>overflow.</mark5><br>
I have but an angry fancy; what is that which I should <mark3>do?</mark3><br>
<br>
I had been content to perish, falling on the foeman's <mark4>ground,</mark4><br>
When the ranks are roll'd in vapour, and the winds are laid with <mark3>sound.</mark3><br>
<br>
But the jingling of the guinea helps the hurt that Honour <mark4>feels,</mark4><br>
And the nations do but murmur, snarling at each other's <mark3>heels.</mark3><br>
<br>
Can I but relive in sadness? I will turn that earlier <mark3>page.</mark3><br>
Hide me from my deep emotion, O thou wondrous <mark3>Mother-Age!</mark3><br>
<br>
Make me feel the wild pulsation that I felt before the <mark4>strife,</mark4><br>
When I heard my days before me, and the tumult of my <mark3>life;</mark3><br>
<br>
Yearning for the large excitement that the coming years would <mark4>yield,</mark4><br>
Eager-hearted as a boy when first he leaves his father's <mark3>field,</mark3><br>
<br>
And at night along the dusky highway near and nearer <mark4>drawn,</mark4><br>
Sees in heaven the light of London flaring like a dreary <mark3>dawn;</mark3><br>
<br>
And his spirit leaps within him to be gone before him <mark4>then,</mark4><br>
Underneath the light he looks at, in among the throngs of <mark3>men:</mark3><br>
<br>
Men, my brothers, men the workers, ever reaping something <mark3>new:</mark3><br>
That which they have done but earnest of the things that they shall <mark1>do:</mark1><br>
<br>
For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could <mark1>see,</mark1><br>
Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would <mark1>be;</mark1><br>
<br>
Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic <mark4>sails,</mark4><br>
Pilots of the purple twilight dropping down with costly <mark3>bales;</mark3><br>
<br>
Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rain'd a ghastly <mark2>dew</mark2><br>
From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central <mark3>blue;</mark3><br>
<br>
Far along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing <mark4>warm,</mark4><br>
With the standards of the peoples plunging thro' the <mark4>thunder-storm;</mark4><br>
<br>
Till the war-drum throbb'd no longer, and the battle-flags were furl'd<br>
In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the <mark4>world.</mark4><br>
<br>
There the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in <mark3>awe,</mark3><br>
And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal <mark3>law.</mark3><br>
<br>
So I triumph'd ere my passion sweeping thro' me left me <mark1>dry,</mark1><br>
Left me with the palsied heart, and left me with the jaundiced <mark3>eye;</mark3><br>
<br>
Eye, to which all order festers, all things here are out of <mark4>joint:</mark4><br>
Science moves, but slowly, slowly, creeping on from point to <mark3>point:</mark3><br>
<br>
Slowly comes a hungry people, as a lion, creeping <mark5>nigher,</mark5><br>
Glares at one that nods and winks behind a slowly-dying <mark4>fire.</mark4><br>
<br>
Yet I doubt not thro' the ages one increasing purpose <mark4>runs,</mark4><br>
And the thoughts of men are widen'd with the process of the <mark3>suns.</mark3><br>
<br>
What is that to him that reaps not harvest of his youthful <mark4>joys,</mark4><br>
Tho' the deep heart of existence beat for ever like a <mark3>boy's?</mark3><br>
<br>
Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and I linger on the <mark1>shore,</mark1><br>
And the individual withers, and the world is more and <mark1>more.</mark1><br>
<br>
Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and he bears a laden <mark1>breast,</mark1><br>
Full of sad experience, moving toward the stillness of his <mark1>rest.</mark1><br>
<br>
Hark, my merry comrades call me, sounding on the <mark1>bugle-horn,</mark1><br>
They to whom my foolish passion were a target for their <mark3>scorn:</mark3><br>
<br>
Shall it not be scorn to me to harp on such a moulder'd <mark4>string?</mark4><br>
I am shamed thro' all my nature to have loved so slight a <mark3>thing.</mark3><br>
<br>
Weakness to be wroth with weakness! woman's pleasure, woman's <mark1>pain?</mark1><br>
Nature made them blinder motions bounded in a shallower <mark3>brain:</mark3><br>
<br>
Woman is the lesser man, and all thy passions, match'd with <mark1>mine,</mark1><br>
Are as moonlight unto sunlight, and as water unto <mark1>wine?</mark1><br>
<br>
Here at least, where nature sickens, nothing. Ah, for some <mark4>retreat</mark4><br>
Deep in yonder shining <mark4>Orient</mark4>, where my life began to <mark3>beat;</mark3><br>
<br>
Where in wild Mahratta-battle fell my father evil-starr'd,?<br>
I was left a trampled orphan, and a selfish uncle's <mark4>ward.</mark4><br>
<br>
Or to burst all links of habit?there to wander far <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
On from island unto island at the gateways of the <mark1>day.</mark1><br>
<br>
Larger constellations burning, mellow moons and happy <mark4>skies,</mark4><br>
Breadths of tropic shade and palms in cluster, knots of <mark4>Paradise.</mark4><br>
<br>
Never comes the trader, never floats an European flag,<br>
Slides the bird o'er lustrous woodland, swings the trailer from the crag;<br>
<br>
Droops the heavy-blossom'd bower, hangs the heavy-fruited <mark3>tree?</mark3><br>
Summer isles of Eden lying in dark-purple spheres of <mark3>sea.</mark3><br>
<br>
There methinks would be enjoyment more than in this march of <mark1>mind,</mark1><br>
In the steamship, in the railway, in the thoughts that shake <mark3>mankind.</mark3><br>
<br>
There the passions cramp'd no longer shall have scope and breathing <mark4>space;</mark4><br>
I will take some savage woman, she shall rear my dusky <mark3>race.</mark3><br>
<br>
Iron-jointed, supple-sinew'd, they shall dive, and they shall <mark4>run,</mark4><br>
Catch the wild goat by the hair, and hurl their lances in the <mark3>sun;</mark3><br>
<br>
Whistle back the parrot's call, and leap the rainbows of the <mark4>brooks,</mark4><br>
Not with blinded eyesight poring over miserable <mark3>books?</mark3><br>
<br>
Fool, again the dream, the fancy! but I know my words are <mark4>wild,</mark4><br>
But I count the gray barbarian lower than the Christian <mark3>child.</mark3><br>
<br>
I, to herd with narrow <mark4>foreheads</mark4>, vacant of our glorious <mark4>gains,</mark4><br>
Like a beast with lower <mark4>pleasures</mark4>, like a beast with lower <mark3>pains!</mark3><br>
<br>
Mated with a squalid savage?what to me were sun or clime?<br>
I the heir of all the ages, in the foremost files of <mark1>time?</mark1><br>
<br>
I that rather held it better men should perish one by <mark3>one,</mark3><br>
Than that earth should stand at gaze like Joshua's moon in Ajalon!<br>
<br>
Not in vain the distance beacons. Forward, forward let us <mark4>range,</mark4><br>
Let the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of <mark3>change.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thro' the shadow of the globe we sweep into the younger <mark1>day;</mark1><br>
Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of <mark3>Cathay.</mark3><br>
<br>
Mother-Age (for mine I knew not) help me as when life <mark3>begun:</mark3><br>
Rift the hills, and roll the waters, flash the lightnings, weigh the <mark1>Sun.</mark1><br>
<br>
O, I see the crescent promise of my spirit hath not <mark4>set.</mark4><br>
Ancient founts of inspiration well thro' all my fancy <mark3>yet.</mark3><br>
<br>
Howsoever these things be, a long farewell to Locksley <mark1>Hall!</mark1><br>
Now for me the woods may wither, now for me the roof-tree <mark1>fall.</mark1><br>
<br>
Comes a vapour from the margin, blackening over heath and <mark4>holt,</mark4><br>
Cramming all the blast before <mark4>it</mark4>, in its breast a <mark4>thunderbolt.</mark4><br>
<br>
Let it fall on Locksley Hall, with rain or hail, or fire or <mark3>snow;</mark3><br>
For the mighty wind arises, roaring seaward, and I <mark3>go.</mark3><br>
