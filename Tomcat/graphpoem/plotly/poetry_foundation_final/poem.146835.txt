Title : Heat Wave <br>
Author : Samuel Menashe <br><br>

Sheets entangle him   <br>
Naked on his <mark5>bed</mark5><br>
Like a toppled <mark4>mast</mark4><br>
Slack sails <mark5>bedeck</mark5><br>
At sea, no <mark4>ballast</mark4><br>
For that even <mark5>keel</mark5><br>
He cannot <mark5>keep--</mark5><br>
No steering <mark3>wheel</mark3><br>
As he falls <mark3>asleep</mark3><br>
