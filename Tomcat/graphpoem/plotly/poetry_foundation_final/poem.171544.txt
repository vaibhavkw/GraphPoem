Title : After Midnight <br>
Author : Louis Simpson <br><br>

The dark streets are <mark4>deserted,</mark4><br>
With only a drugstore glowing   <br>
<mark4>Softly</mark4>, like a sleeping <mark4>body;</mark4><br>
<br>
With one white, naked bulb   <br>
In the back, that <mark4>shines</mark4><br>
On suicides and <mark4>abortions.</mark4><br>
<br>
Who lives in these dark <mark4>houses?</mark4><br>
I am suddenly aware   <br>
I might live here myself. <br>
<br>
The garage man <mark4>returns</mark4><br>
And puts the change in my <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
Counting the singles <mark4>carefully.</mark4><br>
