Title : Eternity Blues <br>
Author : Hayden Carruth <br><br>

I just had the old Dodge in the <mark1>shop</mark1><br>
with that same damned front-end <mark4>problem,</mark4><br>
and I was out, so to speak, for a test <mark4>run,</mark4><br>
<br>
loafing along, maybe 35 <mark4>m.p.h.,</mark4><br>
down the old Corvallis <mark4>road,</mark4><br>
holding her out of the ruts and <mark4>potholes.</mark4><br>
<br>
That's out in Montana, the Bitterroot Valley.   <br>
Long ways from home is how they say <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
Long ways from home, boys, long long ways from <mark4>home.</mark4><br>
<br>
Might as well not put this clunker in the <mark1>shop</mark1><br>
and keep my hard-earned in my <mark4>pocket,</mark4><br>
she wobbles and humps like a scared <mark4>rabbit.</mark4><br>
<br>
But it's a real fine summer day in <mark4>Corvallis,</mark4><br>
and I'm loafing along watching the <mark4>sprayers</mark4><br>
do their slow drag on the fields of <mark4>alfalfa,</mark4><br>
<br>
and I come to a side road with a little green <mark4>sign</mark4><br>
says "Kurtz Lane" and I said to myself out <mark4>loud,</mark4><br>
"Mistah Kurtz--he alive. Him doing just <mark3>fine,"</mark3><br>
<br>
because of the sign, you see, and because I'm <mark4>lonesome</mark4><br>
and maybe kind of bitter in spite of the <mark4>sunshine.</mark4><br>
It's still a goddamn long ways from <mark1>home.</mark1><br>
<br>
That's one thing, though, that Heart of <mark4>Darkness,</mark4><br>
I read that story every year, I never <mark4>forget</mark4><br>
that crazy old son-of-a-bitch, that <mark4>Kurtz.</mark4><br>
<br>
And the next thing I see about a <mark4>quarter-mile</mark4><br>
down the road is somebody small on the <mark4>shoulder,</mark4><br>
a kid looking for a ride home, I <mark4>figure.</mark4><br>
<br>
And he's a kid all right, maybe ten or <mark4>eleven,</mark4><br>
but no Montana boy, he's an <mark4>Oriental,</mark4><br>
one of those Laotians that got <mark4>resettled.</mark4><br>
<br>
Can't figure why they brought them to <mark4>Montana.</mark4><br>
He's got those big eyes and caved-in <mark4>cheeks</mark4><br>
like the pictures on the TV during <mark4>Vietnam,</mark4><br>
<br>
and his mouth is open a little. I say to myself,   <br>
I'll give him a ride if he wants, and I <mark4>even</mark4><br>
begin to slow <mark4>down</mark4>, but he <mark4>didn't</mark4><br>
<br>
put up his thumb. Just when I went by, he <mark4>waved,</mark4><br>
real quick and shy, but still like he was <mark3>trying</mark3><br>
to reach me. I drove on. Then I bust out <mark3>crying.</mark3><br>
