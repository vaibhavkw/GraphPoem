Title : Graves <br>
Author : Hayden Carruth <br><br>

Both of us had been <mark4>close</mark4><br>
to Joel, and at Joel's death <br>
my friend had gone to the <mark4>wake</mark4><br>
and the memorial <mark4>service</mark4><br>
and more recently he <mark4>had</mark4><br>
visited Joel's grave, there <br>
at the back of the grassy <br>
cemetery among the <mark4>trees,</mark4><br>
"a quiet, gentle place," he <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
"befitting Joel." And I <mark1>said,</mark1><br>
"What's the point of going   <br>
to look at graves?" I <mark4>went</mark4><br>
into one of my <mark4>celebrated</mark4><br>
tirades. "People go to <mark4>look</mark4><br>
at the grave of Keats or <mark4>Hart</mark4><br>
Crane, they go traveling just to   <br>
do it, what a waste of <mark1>time.</mark1><br>
What do they find there? Hell,   <br>
I wouldn't go look at the grave of   <br>
Shakespeare if it was <mark4>just</mark4><br>
down the <mark4>street</mark4>, I <mark4>wouldn't</mark4><br>
look at--" And I stopped. I <br>
was about to say the grave of <mark4>God</mark4><br>
until I realized I'm looking at <mark4>it</mark4><br>
all the <mark1>time....</mark1><br>
