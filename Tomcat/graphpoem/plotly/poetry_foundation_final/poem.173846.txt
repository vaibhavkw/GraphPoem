Title : Piano <br>
Author : D. H. Lawrence <br><br>

Softly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to <mark3>me;</mark3><br>
Taking me back down the vista of years, till I <mark3>see</mark3><br>
A child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling <mark3>strings</mark3><br>
And pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she <mark3>sings.</mark3><br>
<br>
In spite of myself, the insidious mastery of <mark3>song</mark3><br>
Betrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to <mark3>belong</mark3><br>
To the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter <mark3>outside</mark3><br>
And hymns in the cosy parlour, the tinkling piano our <mark3>guide.</mark3><br>
<br>
So now it is vain for the singer to burst into <mark3>clamour</mark3><br>
With the great black piano appassionato. The <mark3>glamour</mark3><br>
Of childish days is upon me, my manhood is <mark3>cast</mark3><br>
Down in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the <mark3>past.</mark3><br>
