Title : A Noiseless Patient Spider <br>
Author : Walt Whitman <br><br>

A noiseless patient spider, <br>
I mark'd where on a little promontory it stood <mark4>isolated,</mark4><br>
Mark'd how to explore the vacant vast surrounding, <br>
It launch'd forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself, <br>
Ever unreeling <mark1>them</mark1>, ever tirelessly speeding <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
<br>
And you O my soul where you <mark4>stand,</mark4><br>
Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space, <br>
Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
Till the bridge you will need be form'd, till the ductile anchor <mark4>hold,</mark4><br>
Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.<br>
