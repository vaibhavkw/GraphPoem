Title : The Elements of San Joaquin <br>
Author : Gary Soto <br><br>

for Cesar <mark4>Chavez</mark4><br>
<br>
The wind sprays pale dirt into my mouth <br>
The small, almost invisible <mark4>scars</mark4><br>
On my <mark4>hands.</mark4><br>
The pores in my throat and <mark4>elbows</mark4><br>
<br>
Have taken in a seed of dirt of their <mark4>own.</mark4><br>
After a day in the grape fields near Rolinda <br>
<br>
A fine <mark4>silt</mark4>, washed by <mark4>sweat,</mark4><br>
Has settled into the <mark4>lines</mark4><br>
On my wrists and <mark4>palms.</mark4><br>
Already I am becoming the <mark1>valley,</mark1><br>
<br>
A soil that sprouts <mark1>nothing.</mark1><br>
For any of <mark4>us.</mark4><br>
A dry wind over the <mark1>valley</mark1><br>
<br>
Peeled mountains, grain by <mark4>grain,</mark4><br>
<br>
To small slopes, loose <mark4>dirt</mark4><br>
Where red ants <mark4>tunnel.</mark4><br>
The wind <mark4>strokes</mark4><br>
The skulls and spines of <mark4>cattle</mark4><br>
<br>
To white dust, to <mark1>nothing,</mark1><br>
Covers the spiked tracks of <mark4>beetles,</mark4><br>
Of tumbleweed, of <mark4>sparrows</mark4><br>
<br>
That pecked the ground for <mark4>insects.</mark4><br>
Evenings, when I am in the yard <mark4>weeding,</mark4><br>
The wind picks up the breath of my <mark4>armpits</mark4><br>
<br>
Like <mark4>dust</mark4>, swirls <mark4>it</mark4><br>
Miles away<br>
And drops <mark1>it</mark1><br>
On the ear of a rabid <mark3>dog,</mark3><br>
<br>
And I take on another life.<br>
When you got up this morning the <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
Blazed an hour in the sky,<br>
<br>
A lizard <mark4>hid</mark4><br>
<br>
Under the curled leaves of manzanita <br>
And winked its dark <mark4>lids.</mark4><br>
<br>
Later, the sky <mark5>grayed,</mark5><br>
And the cold wind you <mark4>breathed</mark4><br>
Was moving under your skin and already <mark4>far</mark4><br>
<br>
From the small hives of your <mark4>lungs.</mark4><br>
At dusk the first stars <mark4>appear.</mark4><br>
Not one eager finger points toward them. <br>
A little later the stars spread with the <mark4>night</mark4><br>
<br>
And an orange moon <mark4>rises</mark4><br>
<br>
To lead them, like a shepherd, toward <mark4>dawn.</mark4><br>
In June the sun is a bonnet of <mark3>light</mark3><br>
Coming <mark1>up,</mark1><br>
Little by <mark4>little,</mark4><br>
From behind a skyline of <mark4>pine.</mark4><br>
<br>
The pastures sway with <mark4>fiddle-neck,</mark4><br>
<br>
Tassels of <mark4>foxtail.</mark4><br>
At Piedra<br>
A couple fish on the river's edge, <br>
Their shadows deep against the <mark4>water.</mark4><br>
<br>
Above, in the stubbled <mark4>slopes,</mark4><br>
Cows climb <mark4>down</mark4><br>
<br>
As the heat <mark1>rises</mark1><br>
In a mist of blond <mark4>locusts,</mark4><br>
Returning to the <mark1>valley.</mark1><br>
When autumn rains flatten sycamore <mark4>leaves,</mark4><br>
The tiny volcanos of <mark1>dirt</mark1><br>
Ants raised around their <mark4>holes,</mark4><br>
I should be out of <mark4>work.</mark4><br>
My silverware and stack of plates will go <mark4>unused</mark4><br>
<br>
Like the old, my two good <mark4>slacks</mark4><br>
<br>
Will smother under a growth of <mark4>lint</mark4><br>
And smell of the old <mark4>dust</mark4><br>
That <mark1>rises</mark1><br>
When the closet door opens or <mark4>closes.</mark4><br>
<br>
The skin of my belly will tighten like a <mark4>belt</mark4><br>
And there will be no reason for <mark4>pockets.</mark4><br>
East of the sun's slant, in the vineyard that never <mark4>failed,</mark4><br>
A wind crossed my face, moving the <mark1>dust</mark1><br>
And a portion of my voice a step closer to a new <mark3>year.</mark3><br>
The sky went black in the ninth hour of rolling <mark4>trays,</mark4><br>
<br>
And in the distance ropes of rain dropped to pull <mark3>me</mark3><br>
From the thick harvest that was not <mark4>mine.</mark4><br>
<br>
If you go to your window<br>
<br>
You will notice a fog drifting <mark4>in.</mark4><br>
The sun is no stronger than a <mark4>flashlight.</mark4><br>
Not all the <mark4>sweaters</mark4><br>
<br>
Hung in closets all <mark4>summer</mark4><br>
Could soak up this mist. The <mark3>fog:</mark3><br>
A mouth nibbling everything to its <mark4>origin,</mark4><br>
<br>
Pomegranate <mark4>trees</mark4>, stolen <mark4>bicycles,</mark4><br>
<br>
The string of lights at a used-car <mark4>lot,</mark4><br>
A Pontiac with scorched <mark4>valves.</mark4><br>
<br>
In Fresno the fog is <mark4>passing</mark4><br>
The young thief prying a window <mark4>screen,</mark4><br>
Graying my hair that <mark4>falls</mark4><br>
<br>
And goes unfound, my <mark4>fingerprints</mark4><br>
Slowly growing a fur of <mark1>dust?</mark1><br>
One hundred years from now<br>
<br>
There should be no reason to <mark5>believe</mark5><br>
I <mark4>lived.</mark4><br>
<br>
In this moment when the light starts <mark1>up</mark1><br>
In the east and <mark4>rubs</mark4><br>
The horizon until it catches <mark4>fire,</mark4><br>
We enter the fields to hoe,<br>
Row after row, among the small flags of <mark4>onion,</mark4><br>
<br>
Waving off the dragonflies <br>
That ladder the <mark4>air.</mark4><br>
And tears the onions <mark4>raise</mark4><br>
<br>
Do not begin in your eyes but in <mark4>ours,</mark4><br>
<br>
In the salt <mark4>blown</mark4><br>
From one blister into <mark4>another;</mark4><br>
They begin in <mark4>knowing</mark4><br>
<br>
You will never waken to <mark3>bear</mark3><br>
The hour timed to a heart <mark4>beat,</mark4><br>
The wind pressing us closer to the <mark4>ground.</mark4><br>
When the season <mark4>ends,</mark4><br>
<br>
And the onions are unplugged from their <mark4>sleep,</mark4><br>
We won't forget what you failed to <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
And nothing will <mark4>heal</mark4><br>
Under the rain's broken <mark4>fingers.</mark4><br>
