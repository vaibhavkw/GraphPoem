Title : Cool Pastoral on Bloor Street <br>
Author : John Reibetanz <br><br>

<br>
Consider the tragic <mark4>fortitude</mark4><br>
of mannikins, the courage it <mark4>takes</mark4><br>
   under casual poses to do <br>
nothing interminably each <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
To face unflinching (through sunlit <mark4>glass</mark4><br>
<br>
that bars them from it) the rushing <mark3>surf</mark3><br>
of life within reach where they must <mark4>stand</mark4><br>
marooned on their islands' plastic <mark3>turf,</mark3><br>
and not to cry out: more <mark4>heroic</mark4><br>
<br>
than those Romans the lava rain <mark4>stunned</mark4><br>
to statues--misshaped by the <mark4>panic</mark4><br>
that twisted their limbs, glazed with their <mark4>pain</mark4><br>
in black rock--friezes of <mark4>agony.</mark4><br>
<br>
You would never know, from the <mark4>relaxed</mark4><br>
   swivel of this woman's wrist as she <br>
completes a backhand with her <mark4>racket,</mark4><br>
that she will never take <mark4>another</mark4><br>
<br>
swing, or from her smile that she has <mark4>stood</mark4><br>
balanced here on one foot all <mark4>summer</mark4><br>
like one of Dante's damned, and not <mark4>cracked.</mark4><br>
   'Cracked' is my father's word for 'crazy,' <br>
<br>
as in 'You'd have to be cracked to <mark3>pay</mark3><br>
<br>
that much for a pair of shoes.' He's <mark4>not</mark4><br>
crazy, but he forgets, and <mark3>today</mark3><br>
as we pay out his visit's <mark4>hours</mark4><br>
strolling on Bloor, he thinks up the <mark4>same</mark4><br>
questions again minutes after <mark4>he's</mark4><br>
<br>
nodded and smiled at answers to <mark4>them.</mark4><br>
Looking for things to look at and <mark1>not</mark1><br>
think, I focus on another grove <br>
of mummers: headless, their necks poke <mark4>out</mark4><br>
<br>
like worms from the smartly <mark4>turned-over</mark4><br>
collars of turtlenecks and <mark4>jackets.</mark4><br>
You can tell they've also lost their <mark4>arms</mark4><br>
   from the way the sleeves plummet slackly <br>
<br>
off their shoulders--although they, <mark4>ashamed</mark4><br>
   to show the mutilation, act cool <br>
and tuck the cuffs into their <mark4>pockets.</mark4><br>
   I look at my father--hands trembling, <br>
<br>
head crazed like china with minute <mark4>cracks</mark4><br>
   through which years exit invisibly-- <br>
and must remind myself his show <mark4>is</mark4><br>
kinder, the long-running <mark4>comedy</mark4><br>
<br>
where he's played every <mark4>part</mark4>, from <mark4>fresh-faced</mark4><br>
mooning lover to child-duped <mark4>parent</mark4><br>
to doddering senex: still free now <br>
(while heart and limbs play their <mark4>duet)</mark4><br>
<br>
to do a walk-on, ad lib, bow <mark1>out.</mark1><br>
He sweats a little in the <mark4>sunshine.</mark4><br>
Summer stock, lacking the tragic <mark4>poise</mark4><br>
that freezes these actors in their <mark4>scene,</mark4><br>
<br>
we move on towards a shadier <mark4>place.</mark4><br>
