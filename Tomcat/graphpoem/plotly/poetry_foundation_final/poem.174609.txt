Title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 55 <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

The wish, that of the living <mark3>whole</mark3><br>
No life may fail beyond the <mark4>grave,</mark4><br>
Derives it not from what we <mark4>have</mark4><br>
The likest God within the <mark3>soul?</mark3><br>
<br>
Are God and Nature then at <mark3>strife,</mark3><br>
That Nature lends such evil <mark3>dreams?</mark3><br>
So careful of the type she <mark3>seems,</mark3><br>
So careless of the single <mark3>life;</mark3><br>
<br>
That I, considering <mark4>everywhere</mark4><br>
Her secret meaning in her <mark4>deeds,</mark4><br>
And finding that of fifty <mark3>seeds</mark3><br>
She often brings but one to <mark4>bear,</mark4><br>
<br>
I falter where I firmly <mark3>trod,</mark3><br>
And falling with my weight of <mark4>cares</mark4><br>
Upon the great world's <mark3>altar-stairs</mark3><br>
That slope thro' darkness up to <mark3>God,</mark3><br>
<br>
I stretch lame hands of faith, and <mark3>grope,</mark3><br>
And gather dust and chaff, and <mark4>call</mark4><br>
To what I feel is Lord of <mark3>all,</mark3><br>
And faintly trust the larger <mark3>hope.</mark3><br>
