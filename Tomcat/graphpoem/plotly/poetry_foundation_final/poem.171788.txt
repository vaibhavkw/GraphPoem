Title : Advice to a Prophet <br>
Author : Richard Wilbur <br><br>

When you come, as you soon must, to the streets of our <mark3>city,</mark3><br>
Mad-eyed from stating the <mark4>obvious,</mark4><br>
Not proclaiming our fall but begging <mark4>us</mark4><br>
In God's name to have <mark3>self-pity,</mark3><br>
<br>
Spare us all word of the weapons, their force and <mark3>range,</mark3><br>
The long numbers that rocket the <mark3>mind;</mark3><br>
Our slow, unreckoning hearts will be left <mark3>behind,</mark3><br>
Unable to fear what is too <mark3>strange.</mark3><br>
<br>
Nor shall you scare us with talk of the death of the <mark4>race.</mark4><br>
How should we dream of this place without <mark1>us?--</mark1><br>
The sun mere fire, the leaves untroubled about <mark1>us,</mark1><br>
A stone look on the stone's <mark4>face?</mark4><br>
<br>
Speak of the world's own change. Though we cannot <mark3>conceive</mark3><br>
Of an undreamt thing, we know to our <mark3>cost</mark3><br>
How the dreamt cloud crumbles, the vines are blackened by <mark3>frost,</mark3><br>
How the view alters. We could <mark3>believe,</mark3><br>
<br>
If you told us so, that the white-tailed deer will <mark3>slip</mark3><br>
Into perfect shade, grown perfectly <mark3>shy,</mark3><br>
The lark avoid the reaches of our <mark3>eye,</mark3><br>
The jack-pine lose its knuckled <mark3>grip</mark3><br>
<br>
On the cold ledge, and every torrent <mark3>burn</mark3><br>
As Xanthus once, its gliding <mark4>trout</mark4><br>
Stunned in a twinkling. What should we be <mark3>without</mark3><br>
The dolphin's arc, the dove's <mark3>return,</mark3><br>
<br>
These things in which we have seen ourselves and <mark4>spoken?</mark4><br>
Ask us, prophet, how we shall <mark3>call</mark3><br>
Our natures forth when that live tongue is <mark3>all</mark3><br>
Dispelled, that glass obscured or <mark3>broken</mark3><br>
<br>
In which we have said the rose of our love and the <mark4>clean</mark4><br>
Horse of our courage, in which <mark4>beheld</mark4><br>
The singing locust of the soul unshelled, <br>
And all we mean or wish to <mark3>mean.</mark3><br>
<br>
Ask us, ask us whether with the worldless <mark3>rose</mark3><br>
Our hearts shall fail us; come <mark3>demanding</mark3><br>
Whether there shall be lofty or long <mark3>standing</mark3><br>
When the bronze annals of the oak-tree <mark3>close.</mark3><br>
