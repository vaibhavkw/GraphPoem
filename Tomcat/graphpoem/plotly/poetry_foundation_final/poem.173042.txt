LXVI. Upon the Disobedient <mark4>Child.</mark4><br>
Children become, while little, our <mark5>delights,</mark5><br>
When they grow bigger, they begin to <mark4>fright's.</mark4><br>
Their sinful Nature prompts them to <mark3>rebel,</mark3><br>
And to delight in Paths that lead to <mark3>Hell.</mark3><br>
Their Parents Love, and Care, they <mark4>overlook,</mark4><br>
As if Relation had them quite <mark4>forsook.</mark4><br>
They take the Counsels of the Wanton's <mark4>rather,</mark4><br>
Then the most grave Instructions of a <mark4>Father.</mark4><br>
They reckon Parents ought to do for <mark5>them,</mark5><br>
Tho they the Fifth Commandement <mark5>contemn.</mark5><br>
They snap, and snarl, if Parents them <mark5>controul,</mark5><br>
Tho but in things, most hurtful to the <mark4>Soul.</mark4><br>
They reckon they are Masters, and that <mark3>we,</mark3><br>
Who Parents are, should to them Subject <mark3>be!</mark3><br>
If Parents fain would have a hand in chusing,<br>
The Children have a heart will in refusing.<br>
They'l by wrong doings, under Parents, <mark4>gather</mark4><br>
And say, it is no Sin to rob a <mark1>Father,</mark1><br>
They'l jostle Parents out of place and <mark4>Pow'r,</mark4><br>
They'l make themselves the Head, and them <mark4>devour.</mark4><br>
How many Children, by becoming <mark4>Head,</mark4><br>
Have brought their Parents to a peice of <mark3>Bread!</mark3><br>
Thus they who at the first were Parents <mark3>Joy,</mark3><br>
Turn that to Bitterness, themselves <mark3>destroy.</mark3><br>
       But Wretched Child, how canst thou thus requite<br>
Thy Aged Parents, for that great <mark5>delight</mark5><br>
They took in thee, when thou, as helpless <mark3>lay</mark3><br>
In their Indulgent Bosoms day by <mark3>day?</mark3><br>
Thy Mother, long before she brought thee <mark5>forth,</mark5><br>
Took care thou should'st want, neither Food, nor <mark4>Cloth.</mark4><br>
Thy Father glad was at his very <mark4>heart,</mark4><br>
Had he, to thee, a Portion to <mark3>impart.</mark3><br>
Comfort they promised themselves in <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
But thou, it seems, to them a Grief wil't <mark1>be.</mark1><br>
How oft! How willingly brake they their <mark3>Sleep,</mark3><br>
If thou, their Bantling, didst but whinch or <mark3>weep.</mark3><br>
Their Love to thee was such, they could have giv'n,<br>
That thou might'st live, almost, their part of <mark5>Heav'n.</mark5><br>
But now, behold, how they rewarded <mark3>are!</mark3><br>
For their Indulgent Love, and tender <mark4>Care,</mark4><br>
All is forgot, this Love he doth <mark4>despise,</mark4><br>
They brought this Bird up to pick out their <mark3>Eyes.</mark3><br>
