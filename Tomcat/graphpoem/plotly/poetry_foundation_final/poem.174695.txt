Title : The Morning-Watch <br>
Author : Henry Vaughan <br><br>

O joys! infinite sweetness! with what <mark4>flow'rs</mark4><br>
And shoots of glory my soul breaks and <mark4>buds!</mark4><br>
All the long <mark4>hours</mark4><br>
Of <mark4>night</mark4>, and <mark4>rest,</mark4><br>
Through the still <mark4>shrouds</mark4><br>
Of sleep, and <mark3>clouds,</mark3><br>
This dew fell on my <mark3>breast;</mark3><br>
Oh, how it <mark4>bloods</mark4><br>
And spirits all my earth! Hark! In what <mark4>rings</mark4><br>
And hymning circulations the quick <mark4>world</mark4><br>
Awakes and <mark3>sings;</mark3><br>
The rising <mark4>winds</mark4><br>
And falling <mark4>springs,</mark4><br>
Birds, beasts, all <mark3>things</mark3><br>
Adore him in their <mark4>kinds.</mark4><br>
Thus all is <mark4>hurl'd</mark4><br>
In sacred hymns and order, the great <mark3>chime</mark3><br>
And symphony of nature. Prayer <mark4>is</mark4><br>
               The world in tune,<br>
A spirit <mark4>voice,</mark4><br>
And vocal <mark4>joys</mark4><br>
Whose echo is heav'n's <mark4>bliss.</mark4><br>
O let me <mark3>climb</mark3><br>
When I lie down! The pious soul by <mark4>night</mark4><br>
Is like a clouded star whose beams, though <mark4>said</mark4><br>
To shed their <mark3>light</mark3><br>
Under some <mark4>cloud,</mark4><br>
Yet are <mark4>above,</mark4><br>
And shine and <mark4>move</mark4><br>
Beyond that misty <mark3>shroud.</mark3><br>
So in my <mark4>bed,</mark4><br>
That curtain'd grave, though sleep, like ashes, <mark4>hide</mark4><br>
My lamp and life, both shall in thee <mark3>abide.</mark3><br>
