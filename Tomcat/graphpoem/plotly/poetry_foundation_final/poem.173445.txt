Title : Mac Flecknoe <br>
Author : John Dryden <br><br>

A Satire upon the True-blue Protestant Poet <mark4>T.S.</mark4><br>
All human things are subject to <mark3>decay,</mark3><br>
And, when Fate summons, monarchs must <mark3>obey:</mark3><br>
This Flecknoe found, who, like Augustus, <mark4>young</mark4><br>
Was call'd to empire, and had govern'd <mark4>long:</mark4><br>
In prose and verse, was own'd, without <mark4>dispute</mark4><br>
Through all the realms of Non-sense, <mark4>absolute.</mark4><br>
This aged prince now flourishing in <mark4>peace,</mark4><br>
And blest with issue of a large <mark3>increase,</mark3><br>
Worn out with business, did at length <mark4>debate</mark4><br>
To settle the succession of the <mark3>State:</mark3><br>
And pond'ring which of all his sons was <mark4>fit</mark4><br>
To reign, and wage immortal war with <mark3>wit;</mark3><br>
Cry'd, 'tis resolv'd; for nature pleads that <mark3>he</mark3><br>
Should only rule, who most resembles <mark3>me:</mark3><br>
Shadwell alone my perfect image <mark4>bears,</mark4><br>
Mature in dullness from his tender <mark4>years.</mark4><br>
Shadwell alone, of all my sons, is <mark1>he</mark1><br>
Who stands confirm'd in full stupidity.<br>
The rest to some faint meaning make <mark5>pretence,</mark5><br>
But Shadwell never deviates into <mark4>sense.</mark4><br>
Some beams of wit on other souls may <mark4>fall,</mark4><br>
Strike through and make a lucid <mark4>interval;</mark4><br>
But Shadwell's genuine night admits no <mark3>ray,</mark3><br>
His rising fogs prevail upon the <mark3>day:</mark3><br>
Besides his goodly fabric fills the <mark3>eye,</mark3><br>
And seems design'd for thoughtless <mark4>majesty:</mark4><br>
Thoughtless as monarch oaks, that shade the <mark3>plain,</mark3><br>
And, spread in solemn state, supinely <mark3>reign.</mark3><br>
Heywood and Shirley were but types of <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
Thou last great prophet of tautology:<br>
Even I, a dunce of more renown than <mark3>they,</mark3><br>
Was sent before but to prepare thy <mark3>way;</mark3><br>
And coarsely clad in Norwich drugget <mark3>came</mark3><br>
To teach the nations in thy greater <mark3>name.</mark3><br>
My warbling lute, the lute I whilom <mark4>strung</mark4><br>
When to King John of Portugal I <mark3>sung,</mark3><br>
Was but the prelude to that glorious <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
When thou on silver Thames did'st cut thy <mark1>way,</mark1><br>
With well tim'd oars before the royal <mark3>barge,</mark3><br>
Swell'd with the pride of thy celestial <mark3>charge;</mark3><br>
And big with hymn, commander of an <mark4>host,</mark4><br>
The like was ne'er in Epsom blankets <mark4>toss'd.</mark4><br>
Methinks I see the new Arion <mark4>sail,</mark4><br>
The lute still trembling underneath thy <mark3>nail.</mark3><br>
At thy well sharpen'd thumb from shore to <mark3>shore</mark3><br>
The treble squeaks for <mark4>fear</mark4>, the basses <mark3>roar:</mark3><br>
Echoes from Pissing-Alley, Shadwell <mark4>call,</mark4><br>
And Shadwell they resound from Aston <mark3>Hall.</mark3><br>
About thy boat the little fishes <mark4>throng,</mark4><br>
As at the morning toast, that floats <mark3>along.</mark3><br>
Sometimes as prince of thy harmonious <mark3>band</mark3><br>
Thou wield'st thy papers in thy threshing <mark3>hand.</mark3><br>
St. Andre's feet ne'er kept more equal <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
Not ev'n the feet of thy own Psyche's <mark3>rhyme:</mark3><br>
Though they in number as in sense <mark4>excel;</mark4><br>
So just, so like tautology they <mark3>fell,</mark3><br>
That, pale with envy, Singleton forswore<br>
The lute and sword which he in triumph <mark3>bore</mark3><br>
And vow'd he ne'er would act Villerius <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
Here stopt the good old sire; and wept for <mark3>joy</mark3><br>
In silent raptures of the hopeful <mark3>boy.</mark3><br>
All arguments, but most his plays, <mark4>persuade,</mark4><br>
That for anointed dullness he was <mark3>made.</mark3><br>
<br>
Close to the walls which fair Augusta <mark4>bind,</mark4><br>
(The fair Augusta much to fears <mark5>inclin'd)</mark5><br>
An ancient fabric, rais'd t'inform the <mark4>sight,</mark4><br>
There stood of yore, and Barbican it <mark3>hight:</mark3><br>
A watch tower once; but now, so fate ordains,<br>
Of all the pile an empty name <mark4>remains.</mark4><br>
From its old ruins brothel-houses <mark4>rise,</mark4><br>
Scenes of lewd <mark4>loves</mark4>, and of polluted <mark4>joys.</mark4><br>
Where their vast courts, the mother-strumpets <mark3>keep,</mark3><br>
And, undisturb'd by watch, in silence <mark3>sleep.</mark3><br>
Near these a nursery erects its <mark4>head,</mark4><br>
Where queens are form'd, and future heroes <mark3>bred;</mark3><br>
Where unfledg'd actors learn to laugh and <mark3>cry,</mark3><br>
Where infant punks their tender voices <mark3>try,</mark3><br>
And little Maximins the gods <mark3>defy.</mark3><br>
Great Fletcher never treads in buskins <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
Nor greater Jonson dares in socks <mark4>appear;</mark4><br>
But gentle Simkin just reception <mark4>finds</mark4><br>
Amidst this monument of vanish'd <mark3>minds:</mark3><br>
Pure <mark4>clinches</mark4>, the suburbian muse <mark4>affords;</mark4><br>
And Panton waging harmless war with <mark4>words.</mark4><br>
Here Flecknoe, as a place to fame well <mark4>known,</mark4><br>
Ambitiously design'd his Shadwell's <mark3>throne.</mark3><br>
For ancient Decker prophesi'd long <mark4>since,</mark4><br>
That in this pile should reign a mighty <mark3>prince,</mark3><br>
Born for a scourge of wit, and flail of <mark1>sense:</mark1><br>
To whom true dullness should some Psyches <mark3>owe,</mark3><br>
But worlds of Misers from his pen should <mark3>flow;</mark3><br>
Humorists and hypocrites it should <mark4>produce,</mark4><br>
Whole Raymond families, and tribes of <mark3>Bruce.</mark3><br>
<br>
Now Empress Fame had publisht the <mark4>renown,</mark4><br>
Of Shadwell's coronation through the <mark3>town.</mark3><br>
Rous'd by report of fame, the nations <mark4>meet,</mark4><br>
From near Bun-Hill, and distant <mark3>Watling-street.</mark3><br>
No Persian carpets spread th'imperial <mark1>way,</mark1><br>
But scatter'd limbs of mangled poets <mark3>lay:</mark3><br>
From dusty shops neglected authors <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
Martyrs of pies, and reliques of the <mark3>bum.</mark3><br>
Much Heywood, Shirley, Ogleby there <mark1>lay,</mark1><br>
But loads of Shadwell almost chok'd the <mark1>way.</mark1><br>
Bilk'd stationers for yeoman stood <mark5>prepar'd,</mark5><br>
And Herringman was Captain of the <mark4>Guard.</mark4><br>
The hoary prince in majesty <mark4>appear'd,</mark4><br>
High on a throne of his own labours <mark3>rear'd.</mark3><br>
At his right hand our young Ascanius <mark4>sat</mark4><br>
Rome's other hope, and pillar of the <mark1>state.</mark1><br>
His brows thick fogs, instead of glories, <mark4>grace,</mark4><br>
And lambent dullness play'd around his <mark3>face.</mark3><br>
As Hannibal did to the altars <mark1>come,</mark1><br>
Sworn by his sire a mortal foe to <mark4>Rome;</mark4><br>
So Shadwell swore, nor should his vow be <mark4>vain,</mark4><br>
That he till death true dullness would <mark3>maintain;</mark3><br>
And in his father's right, and realm's <mark4>defence,</mark4><br>
Ne'er to have peace with wit, nor truce with <mark1>sense.</mark1><br>
The king himself the sacred unction <mark1>made,</mark1><br>
As king by office, and as priest by <mark3>trade:</mark3><br>
In his sinister hand, instead of <mark4>ball,</mark4><br>
He plac'd a mighty mug of potent <mark4>ale;</mark4><br>
Love's kingdom to his right he did <mark3>convey,</mark3><br>
At once his sceptre and his rule of <mark3>sway;</mark3><br>
Whose righteous lore the prince had practis'd <mark1>young,</mark1><br>
And from whose loins recorded Psyche <mark3>sprung,</mark3><br>
His temples last with poppies were o'er <mark4>spread,</mark4><br>
That nodding seem'd to consecrate his <mark1>head:</mark1><br>
Just at that point of time, if fame not <mark3>lie,</mark3><br>
On his left hand twelve reverend owls did <mark3>fly.</mark3><br>
So Romulus, 'tis sung, by Tiber's <mark3>brook,</mark3><br>
Presage of sway from twice six vultures <mark3>took.</mark3><br>
Th'admiring throng loud acclamations <mark4>make,</mark4><br>
And omens of his future empire <mark3>take.</mark3><br>
The sire then shook the honours of his <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
And from his brows damps of oblivion <mark3>shed</mark3><br>
Full on the filial dullness: long he <mark4>stood,</mark4><br>
Repelling from his breast the raging <mark4>god;</mark4><br>
At length burst out in this prophetic <mark4>mood:</mark4><br>
<br>
Heavens bless my <mark4>son</mark4>, from Ireland let him <mark1>reign</mark1><br>
To far Barbadoes on the Western <mark3>main;</mark3><br>
Of his dominion may no end be <mark1>known,</mark1><br>
And greater than his father's be his <mark1>throne.</mark1><br>
Beyond love's kingdom let him stretch his <mark4>pen;</mark4><br>
He paus'd, and all the people cry'd <mark3>Amen.</mark3><br>
Then thus, continu'd he, my son <mark4>advance</mark4><br>
Still in new impudence, new <mark4>ignorance.</mark4><br>
Success let other teach, learn thou from <mark1>me</mark1><br>
Pangs without birth, and fruitless <mark4>industry.</mark4><br>
Let Virtuosos in five years be <mark4>writ;</mark4><br>
Yet not one thought accuse thy toil of <mark1>wit.</mark1><br>
Let gentle George in triumph tread the <mark4>stage,</mark4><br>
Make Dorimant betray, and Loveit <mark3>rage;</mark3><br>
Let Cully, Cockwood, Fopling, charm the <mark3>pit,</mark3><br>
And in their folly show the writer's <mark1>wit.</mark1><br>
Yet still thy fools shall stand in thy <mark1>defence,</mark1><br>
And justify their author's want of <mark1>sense.</mark1><br>
Let 'em be all by thy own model <mark1>made</mark1><br>
Of dullness, and desire no foreign <mark3>aid:</mark3><br>
That they to future ages may be <mark1>known,</mark1><br>
Not copies <mark4>drawn</mark4>, but issue of thy <mark3>own.</mark3><br>
Nay let thy men of wit too be the <mark4>same,</mark4><br>
All full of thee, and differing but in <mark1>name;</mark1><br>
But let no alien Sedley <mark4>interpose</mark4><br>
To lard with wit thy hungry Epsom <mark3>prose.</mark3><br>
And when false flowers of rhetoric thou would'st <mark4>cull,</mark4><br>
Trust Nature, do not labour to be <mark3>dull;</mark3><br>
But write thy best, and top; and in each <mark4>line,</mark4><br>
Sir Formal's oratory will be <mark3>thine.</mark3><br>
Sir Formal, though unsought, attends thy <mark4>quill,</mark4><br>
And does thy Northern Dedications <mark3>fill.</mark3><br>
Nor let false friends seduce thy mind to <mark3>fame,</mark3><br>
By arrogating Jonson's hostile <mark1>name.</mark1><br>
Let Father Flecknoe fire thy mind with <mark4>praise,</mark4><br>
And Uncle Ogleby thy envy <mark3>raise.</mark3><br>
Thou art my blood, where Jonson has no <mark4>part;</mark4><br>
What share have we in Nature or in <mark3>Art?</mark3><br>
Where did his wit on learning fix a <mark4>brand,</mark4><br>
And rail at arts he did not <mark3>understand?</mark3><br>
Where made he love in Prince Nicander's <mark4>vein,</mark4><br>
Or swept the dust in Psyche's humble <mark3>strain?</mark3><br>
Where sold he bargains, whip-stitch, kiss my <mark4>arse,</mark4><br>
Promis'd a play and dwindled to a <mark3>farce?</mark3><br>
When did his muse from Fletcher scenes <mark4>purloin,</mark4><br>
As thou whole Eth'ridge dost transfuse to <mark1>thine?</mark1><br>
But so transfus'd as oil on waters <mark1>flow,</mark1><br>
His always floats above, thine sinks <mark3>below.</mark3><br>
This is thy province, this thy wondrous <mark1>way,</mark1><br>
New humours to invent for each new <mark3>play:</mark3><br>
This is that boasted bias of thy <mark4>mind,</mark4><br>
By which one way, to dullness, 'tis <mark1>inclin'd,</mark1><br>
Which makes thy writings lean on one side <mark3>still,</mark3><br>
And in all changes that way bends thy <mark3>will.</mark3><br>
Nor let thy mountain belly make <mark1>pretence</mark1><br>
Of <mark4>likeness</mark4>, thine's a tympany of <mark1>sense.</mark1><br>
A tun of man in thy large bulk is <mark1>writ,</mark1><br>
But sure thou 'rt but a kilderkin of <mark1>wit.</mark1><br>
Like mine thy gentle numbers feebly <mark3>creep,</mark3><br>
Thy Tragic Muse gives smiles, thy Comic <mark1>sleep.</mark1><br>
With whate'er gall thou sett'st thy self to <mark4>write,</mark4><br>
Thy inoffensive satires never <mark3>bite.</mark3><br>
In thy felonious heart, though venom <mark4>lies,</mark4><br>
It does but touch thy Irish pen, and <mark3>dies.</mark3><br>
Thy genius calls thee not to purchase <mark1>fame</mark1><br>
In keen iambics, but mild <mark4>anagram:</mark4><br>
Leave writing plays, and choose for thy <mark4>command</mark4><br>
Some peaceful province in acrostic <mark3>land.</mark3><br>
There thou may'st wings display and altars <mark1>raise,</mark1><br>
And torture one poor word ten thousand <mark3>ways.</mark3><br>
Or if thou would'st thy diff'rent talents <mark4>suit,</mark4><br>
Set thy own songs, and sing them to thy <mark3>lute.</mark3><br>
He <mark4>said</mark4>, but his last words were scarcely <mark4>heard,</mark4><br>
For Bruce and Longvil had a trap <mark1>prepar'd,</mark1><br>
And down they sent the yet declaiming <mark4>bard.</mark4><br>
Sinking he left his drugget robe <mark4>behind,</mark4><br>
Born upwards by a subterranean <mark3>wind.</mark3><br>
The mantle fell to the young prophet's <mark1>part,</mark1><br>
With double portion of his father's <mark1>art.</mark1><br>
