Title : Advent <br>
Author : Mary Jo Salter <br><br>

Wind whistling, as it <mark4>does</mark4><br>
in winter, and I <mark4>think</mark4><br>
nothing of it <mark4>until</mark4><br>
<br>
it snaps a shutter <mark4>off</mark4><br>
her bedroom window, <mark4>spins</mark4><br>
it over the roof and <mark4>down</mark4><br>
<br>
to crash on the deck in <mark4>back,</mark4><br>
like something out of <mark4>Oz.</mark4><br>
We look up, stunned--then <mark4>glad</mark4><br>
<br>
to be safe and have a story,   <br>
characters in a <mark4>fable</mark4><br>
we only half-believe. <br>
<br>
Look, in my <mark4>surprise</mark4><br>
I somehow split a <mark4>wall,</mark4><br>
the last one in the <mark4>house</mark4><br>
<br>
we're making of <mark4>gingerbread.</mark4><br>
We'll have to <mark3>improvise:</mark3><br>
prop the two halves <mark4>forward</mark4><br>
<br>
like an open double <mark3>door</mark3><br>
and with a tube of <mark4>icing</mark4><br>
cement them to the <mark3>floor.</mark3><br>
<br>
Five days until <mark4>Christmas,</mark4><br>
and the house cannot be <mark4>closed.</mark4><br>
When she peers into the <mark4>cold</mark4><br>
<br>
interior we've <mark4>exposed,</mark4><br>
she half-expects to <mark4>find</mark4><br>
three magi in the <mark4>manger,</mark4><br>
<br>
a mother and her <mark4>child.</mark4><br>
She half-expects to <mark4>read</mark4><br>
on tablets of <mark1>gingerbread</mark1><br>
<br>
a line or two of <mark4>Scripture,</mark4><br>
as she has every <mark4>morning</mark4><br>
inside a dated <mark4>shutter</mark4><br>
<br>
on her Advent <mark4>calendar.</mark4><br>
She takes it from the <mark4>mantel</mark4><br>
and coaxes one <mark5>fingertip</mark5><br>
<br>
under the <mark4>perforation,</mark4><br>
as if her future <mark4>hinges</mark4><br>
on not tearing off the <mark4>flap</mark4><br>
<br>
under which a thumbnail <mark4>picture</mark4><br>
by Raphael or Giorgione,   <br>
Hans Memling or <mark4>David</mark4><br>
<br>
of apses, niches, archways,   <br>
cradles a smaller <mark4>scene</mark4><br>
of a mother and her <mark1>child,</mark1><br>
<br>
of the lidded <mark4>jewel-box</mark4><br>
of Mary's downcast <mark4>eyes.</mark4><br>
Flee into Egypt, <mark3>cries</mark3><br>
<br>
the angel of the <mark4>Lord</mark4><br>
to Joseph in a dream, <br>
for Herod will seek the <mark4>young</mark4><br>
<br>
child to destroy him. <mark4>While</mark4><br>
she works to tile the <mark4>roof</mark4><br>
with shingled peppermints, <br>
I wash my sugared <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
<br>
and step out to the <mark4>deck</mark4><br>
to lug the shutter <mark4>in,</mark4><br>
a page torn from a <mark4>book</mark4><br>
<br>
still blank for the two of <mark4>us,</mark4><br>
a mother and her <mark1>child.</mark1><br>
