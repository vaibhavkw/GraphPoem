Title : The Village: Book I <br>
Author : George Crabbe <br><br>

The village life, and every care that <mark5>reigns</mark5><br>
O'er youthful peasants and declining <mark1>swains;</mark1><br>
What labour yields, and <mark4>what</mark4>, that labour <mark4>past,</mark4><br>
Age, in its hour of languor, finds at <mark3>last;</mark3><br>
What forms the real picture of the <mark4>poor,</mark4><br>
Demands a song--the Muse can give no <mark4>more.</mark4><br>
Fled are those times, if e'er such times were <mark3>seen,</mark3><br>
When rustic poets praised their native <mark3>green;</mark3><br>
No shepherds now, in smooth alternate <mark3>verse,</mark3><br>
Their country's beauty or their nymphs' <mark3>rehearse;</mark3><br>
Yet still for these we frame the tender <mark4>strain,</mark4><br>
Still in our lays fond Corydons <mark3>complain,</mark3><br>
And shepherds' boys their amorous pains <mark3>reveal,</mark3><br>
The only pains, alas! they never <mark3>feel.</mark3><br>
On Mincio's banks, in Caesar's bounteous <mark3>reign,</mark3><br>
If Tityrus found the Golden Age <mark3>again,</mark3><br>
Must sleepy bards the flattering dream <mark3>prolong,</mark3><br>
Mechanic echoes of the Mantuan <mark3>song?</mark3><br>
From truth and nature shall we widely <mark5>stray,</mark5><br>
Where Virgil, not where Fancy, leads the <mark3>way?</mark3><br>
Yes, thus the Muses sing of happy <mark1>swains,</mark1><br>
Because the Muses never knew their <mark3>pains.</mark3><br>
They boast their peasants' pipes, but peasants <mark3>now</mark3><br>
Resign their pipes and plod behind the <mark3>plough;</mark3><br>
And few amid the rural tribe have <mark3>time</mark3><br>
To number syllables and play with <mark3>rhyme;</mark3><br>
Save honest Duck, what son of verse could <mark4>share</mark4><br>
The poet's rapture and the peasant's <mark3>care?</mark3><br>
Or the great labours of the field <mark3>degrade</mark3><br>
With the new peril of a poorer <mark3>trade?</mark3><br>
From one chief cause these idle praises <mark4>spring,</mark4><br>
That themes so easy few forbear to <mark3>sing;</mark3><br>
They ask no thought, require no deep <mark4>design,</mark4><br>
But swell the song and liquefy the <mark3>line;</mark3><br>
The gentle lover takes the rural <mark1>strain,</mark1><br>
A nymph his mistress and himself a <mark3>swain;</mark3><br>
With no sad scenes he clouds his tuneful <mark3>prayer,</mark3><br>
But all, to look like her, is painted <mark3>fair.</mark3><br>
I grant indeed that fields and flocks have <mark4>charms</mark4><br>
For him that gazes or for him that <mark3>farms;</mark3><br>
But when amid such pleasing scenes I <mark4>trace</mark4><br>
The poor laborious natives of the <mark3>place,</mark3><br>
And see the mid-day sun, with fervid <mark3>ray,</mark3><br>
On their bare heads and dewy temples <mark3>play;</mark3><br>
While some, with feebler heads and fainter <mark4>hearts,</mark4><br>
Deplore their fortune, yet sustain their <mark3>parts:</mark3><br>
Then shall I dare these real ills to <mark4>hide</mark4><br>
In tinsel trappings of poetic <mark3>pride?</mark3><br>
No, cast by Fortune on a frowning <mark4>coast,</mark4><br>
Which can no groves nor happy valleys <mark3>boast;</mark3><br>
Where other cares than those the Muse <mark4>relates,</mark4><br>
And other shepherds dwell with other <mark3>mates;</mark3><br>
By such examples <mark4>taught</mark4>, I paint the <mark4>cot,</mark4><br>
As truth will paint <mark4>it</mark4>, and as bards will <mark3>not:</mark3><br>
Nor you, ye poor, of lettered scorn <mark1>complain,</mark1><br>
To you the smoothest song is smooth in <mark3>vain;</mark3><br>
O'ercome by labour and bowed down by <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
Feel you the barren flattery of a <mark1>rhyme?</mark1><br>
Can poets soothe you, when you pine for <mark4>bread,</mark4><br>
By winding myrtles round your ruined <mark3>shed?</mark3><br>
Can their light tales your weighty griefs <mark4>o'erpower,</mark4><br>
Or glad with airy mirth the toilsome <mark4>hour?</mark4><br>
Lo! where the heath, with withering brake grown <mark2>o'er,</mark2><br>
Lends the light turf that warms the neighboring <mark1>poor;</mark1><br>
From thence a length of burning sand <mark4>appears,</mark4><br>
Where the thin harvest waves its withered <mark3>ears;</mark3><br>
Rank weeds, that every art and care <mark3>defy,</mark3><br>
Reign o'er the land and rob the blighted <mark3>rye:</mark3><br>
There thistles stretch their prickly arms <mark4>afar,</mark4><br>
And to the ragged infant threaten <mark4>war;</mark4><br>
There poppies, nodding, mock the hope of <mark4>toil,</mark4><br>
There the blue bugloss paints the sterile <mark3>soil;</mark3><br>
Hardy and high, above the slender <mark5>sheaf,</mark5><br>
The slimy mallow waves her silky <mark3>leaf;</mark3><br>
O'er the young shoot the charlock throws a <mark4>shade,</mark4><br>
And the wild tare clings round the sickly <mark3>blade;</mark3><br>
With mingled tints the rocky coasts <mark4>abound,</mark4><br>
And a sad splendor vainly shines <mark3>around.</mark3><br>
So looks the nymph whom wretched arts <mark4>adorn,</mark4><br>
Betrayed by <mark4>man</mark4>, then left for man to <mark3>scorn;</mark3><br>
Whose cheek in vain assumes the mimic <mark4>rose</mark4><br>
While her sad eyes the troubled breast <mark3>disclose;</mark3><br>
Whose outward splendour is but folly's <mark4>dress,</mark4><br>
Exposing <mark4>most</mark4>, when most it gilds <mark3>distress.</mark3><br>
Here joyless roam a wild amphibious <mark4>race,</mark4><br>
With sullen woe displayed in every <mark3>face;</mark3><br>
Who far from civil arts and social <mark3>fly,</mark3><br>
And scowl at strangers with suspicious <mark3>eye.</mark3><br>
Here too the lawless merchant of the <mark4>main</mark4><br>
Draws from his plough th' intoxicated <mark1>swain;</mark1><br>
Want only claimed the labor of the <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
But vice now steals his nightly rest <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
Where are the swains, who, daily labor <mark4>done,</mark4><br>
With rural games played down the setting <mark3>sun;</mark3><br>
Who struck with matchless force the bounding <mark4>ball,</mark4><br>
Or made the pond'rous quoit obliquely <mark3>fall;</mark3><br>
While some huge Ajax, terrible and <mark4>strong,</mark4><br>
Engaged some artful stripling of the <mark3>throng,</mark3><br>
And, foiled, beneath the young Ulysses <mark4>fell,</mark4><br>
When peals of praise the merry mischief <mark3>tell?</mark3><br>
Where now are these?--Beneath yon cliff they <mark4>stand,</mark4><br>
To show the freighted pinnace where to <mark3>land;</mark3><br>
To load the ready steed with guilty <mark4>haste;</mark4><br>
To fly in terror o'er the pathless <mark3>waste,</mark3><br>
Or, when detected in their straggling <mark4>course,</mark4><br>
To foil their foes by cunning or by <mark3>force;</mark3><br>
Or, yielding part (when equal knaves <mark4>contest),</mark4><br>
To gain a lawless passport for the <mark3>rest.</mark3><br>
Here, wand'ring long amid these frowning <mark4>fields,</mark4><br>
I sought the simple life that Nature <mark3>yields;</mark3><br>
Rapine and Wrong and Fear usurped her <mark1>place,</mark1><br>
And a bold, artful, surly, savage <mark1>race;</mark1><br>
Who, only skilled to take the finny <mark3>tribe,</mark3><br>
The yearly dinner, or septennial <mark3>bribe</mark3><br>
Wait on the shore and, as the waves run <mark3>high,</mark3><br>
On the tossed vessel bend their eager <mark1>eye,</mark1><br>
Which to their coast directs its vent'rous <mark1>way,</mark1><br>
Theirs, or the ocean's, miserable <mark3>prey.</mark3><br>
As on their neighbouring beach yon swallows <mark1>stand,</mark1><br>
And wait for favoring winds to leave the <mark1>land;</mark1><br>
While still for flight the ready wing is <mark4>spread:</mark4><br>
So waited I the favouring hour, and <mark3>fled;</mark3><br>
Fled from these shores where guilt and famine <mark1>reign,</mark1><br>
And cried, Ah! hapless they who still <mark3>remain;</mark3><br>
Who still remain to hear the ocean <mark3>roar,</mark3><br>
Whose greedy waves devour the lessening <mark3>shore;</mark3><br>
Till some fierce tide, with more imperious <mark3>sway,</mark3><br>
Sweeps the low hut and all it holds <mark1>away;</mark1><br>
When the sad tenant weeps from door to <mark3>door,</mark3><br>
And begs a poor protection from the <mark1>poor!</mark1><br>
But these are scenes where Nature's niggard <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
Gave a spare portion to the famished <mark1>land;</mark1><br>
Hers is the fault, if here mankind <mark1>complain</mark1><br>
Of fruitless toil and labor spent in <mark1>vain;</mark1><br>
But yet in other scenes, more fair in <mark3>view,</mark3><br>
Where Plenty smiles--alas! she smiles for <mark3>few</mark3><br>
And those who taste not, yet behold her <mark4>store,</mark4><br>
Are as the slaves that dig the golden <mark3>ore,</mark3><br>
The wealth around them makes them doubly <mark1>poor.</mark1><br>
Or will you deem them amply paid in <mark5>health,</mark5><br>
Labor's fair child, that languishes with <mark3>wealth?</mark3><br>
Go then! and see them rising with the <mark1>sun,</mark1><br>
Through a long course of daily toil to <mark3>run;</mark3><br>
Like him to make the plenteous harvest <mark3>grow,</mark3><br>
And yet not shard the plenty they <mark3>bestow;</mark3><br>
See them beneath the dog-star's raging <mark4>heat,</mark4><br>
When the knees tremble and the temples <mark3>beat;</mark3><br>
Behold them, leaning on their scythes, look <mark1>o'er</mark1><br>
The labour past, and toils to come <mark4>explore;</mark4><br>
See them alternate suns and showers <mark3>engage,</mark3><br>
And hoard up aches and anguish for their <mark3>age;</mark3><br>
Through fens and marshy moors their steps <mark3>pursue,</mark3><br>
When their warm pores imbibe the evening <mark3>dew;</mark3><br>
Then own that labour may as fatal <mark3>be</mark3><br>
To these thy slaves, as luxury to <mark3>thee.</mark3><br>
Amid this tribe too oft a manly <mark1>pride</mark1><br>
Strives in strong toil the fainting heart to <mark1>hide;</mark1><br>
There may you see the youth of slender <mark4>frame</mark4><br>
Contend with weakness, weariness, and <mark3>shame:</mark3><br>
Yet urged along, and proudly loth to <mark4>yield,</mark4><br>
He strives to join his fellows of the <mark3>field;</mark3><br>
Till long-contending nature droops at <mark1>last,</mark1><br>
Declining health rejects his poor <mark5>repast,</mark5><br>
His cheerless spouse the coming danger <mark4>sees,</mark4><br>
And mutual murmurs urge the slow <mark3>disease.</mark3><br>
Yet grant them health, 'tis not for us to <mark1>tell,</mark1><br>
Though the head droops not, that the heart is <mark3>well;</mark3><br>
Or will you urge their homely, plenteous <mark4>fare,</mark4><br>
Healthy and plain and still the poor man's <mark1>share!</mark1><br>
Oh! trifle not with wants you cannot <mark1>feel,</mark1><br>
Nor mock the misery of a stinted <mark3>meal;</mark3><br>
Homely not wholesome, plain not plenteous, <mark3>such</mark3><br>
As you who envy would disdain to <mark3>touch.</mark3><br>
Ye gentle <mark4>souls</mark4>, who dream of rural <mark3>ease,</mark3><br>
Whom the smooth stream and smoother sonnet <mark3>please;</mark3><br>
Go! if the peaceful cot your praises <mark1>share,</mark1><br>
Go, look within, and ask if peace be <mark3>there:</mark3><br>
If peace be his--that drooping weary <mark4>sire,</mark4><br>
Or theirs, that offspring round their feeble <mark3>fire,</mark3><br>
Or hers, that matron pale, whose trembling <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
Turns on the wretched hearth th' expiring <mark3>brand.</mark3><br>
Nor yet can time itself obtain for <mark3>these</mark3><br>
Life's latest comforts, due respect and <mark1>ease;</mark1><br>
For yonder see that hoary swain, whose <mark1>age</mark1><br>
Can with no cares except his own <mark1>engage;</mark1><br>
Who, propped on that rude staff, looks up to <mark3>see</mark3><br>
The bare arms broken from the withering <mark3>tree,</mark3><br>
On which, a boy, he climbed the loftiest <mark3>bough,</mark3><br>
Then his first joy, but his sad emblem <mark1>now.</mark1><br>
He once was chief in all the rustic <mark1>trade,</mark1><br>
His steady hand the straightest furrow <mark3>made;</mark3><br>
Full many a prize he won, and still is <mark4>proud</mark4><br>
To find the triumphs of his youth <mark3>allowed.</mark3><br>
A transient pleasure sparkles in his <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
He hears and <mark4>smiles</mark4>, then thinks again and <mark3>sighs:</mark3><br>
For now he journeys to his grave in <mark4>pain;</mark4><br>
The rich disdain him, nay, the poor <mark3>disdain;</mark3><br>
Alternate masters now their slave <mark4>command,</mark4><br>
And urge the efforts of his feeble <mark1>hand;</mark1><br>
Who, when his age attempts its task in <mark1>vain,</mark1><br>
With ruthless taunts of lazy poor <mark1>complain.</mark1><br>
Oft may you see him, when he tends the <mark5>sheep,</mark5><br>
His winter-charge, beneath the hillock <mark3>weep;</mark3><br>
Oft hear him murmur to the winds that <mark3>blow</mark3><br>
O'er his white locks and bury them in <mark3>snow;</mark3><br>
<mark4>When</mark4>, roused by rage and muttering in the <mark4>morn,</mark4><br>
He mends the broken hedge with icy <mark3>thorn:</mark3><br>
"Why do I live, when I desire to <mark1>be</mark1><br>
At once from life and life's long labour <mark3>free?</mark3><br>
Like leaves in spring, the young are blown <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
Without the sorrows of a slow <mark3>decay;</mark3><br>
I, like yon withered leaf, remain <mark4>behind,</mark4><br>
Nipped by the frost, and shivering in the <mark3>wind;</mark3><br>
There it abides till younger buds come <mark4>on,</mark4><br>
As I, now all my fellow-swains are <mark3>gone;</mark3><br>
Then, from the rising generation <mark4>thrust,</mark4><br>
It falls, like me, unnoticed to the <mark3>dust.</mark3><br>
"These fruitful fields, these numerous flocks I <mark1>see,</mark1><br>
Are others' gain, but killing cares to <mark3>me;</mark3><br>
To me the children of my youth are <mark4>lords,</mark4><br>
Slow in their gifts but hasty in their <mark4>words:</mark4><br>
Wants of their own demand their care, and <mark3>who</mark3><br>
Feels his own want and succors others <mark3>too?</mark3><br>
A lonely, wretched man, in pain I <mark3>go,</mark3><br>
None need my help and none relieve my <mark3>woe;</mark3><br>
Then let my bones beneath the turf be <mark4>laid,</mark4><br>
And men forget the wretch they would not <mark3>aid."</mark3><br>
Thus groan the old, till, by disease <mark4>oppressed,</mark4><br>
They taste a final woe, and then they <mark1>rest.</mark1><br>
Theirs is yon house that holds the parish <mark1>poor,</mark1><br>
Whose walls of mud scarce bear the broken <mark1>door;</mark1><br>
There, where the putrid vapours, flagging, <mark1>play,</mark1><br>
And the dull wheel hums doleful through the <mark1>day;</mark1><br>
There children dwell, who know no parents' <mark1>care,</mark1><br>
Parents, who know no children's love, dwell <mark1>there;</mark1><br>
Heart-broken matrons on their joyless <mark4>bed,</mark4><br>
Forsaken wives, and mothers never <mark3>wed;</mark3><br>
Dejected widows with unheeded <mark4>tears,</mark4><br>
And crippled age with more than <mark3>childhood-fears;</mark3><br>
The lame, the blind, and, far the happiest <mark3>they!</mark3><br>
The moping idiot and the madman <mark3>gay.</mark3><br>
Here too the sick their final doom <mark3>receive,</mark3><br>
Here brought, amid the scenes of grief, to <mark3>grieve,</mark3><br>
Where the loud groans from some sad chamber <mark3>flow,</mark3><br>
Mixed with the clamors of the crowd <mark3>below;</mark3><br>
Here, sorrowing, they each kindred sorrow <mark4>scan,</mark4><br>
And the cold charities of man to <mark3>man:</mark3><br>
Whose laws indeed for ruined age <mark4>provide,</mark4><br>
And strong compulsion plucks the scrap from <mark1>pride;</mark1><br>
But still that scrap is bought with many a <mark3>sigh,</mark3><br>
And pride embitters what it can't <mark3>deny.</mark3><br>
Say ye, oppressed by some fantastic <mark4>woes,</mark4><br>
Some jarring nerve that baffles your <mark3>repose;</mark3><br>
Who press the downy couch, while slaves <mark4>advance</mark4><br>
With timid eye to read the distant <mark3>glance;</mark3><br>
Who with sad prayers the weary doctor <mark4>tease</mark4><br>
To name the nameless ever-new <mark1>disease;</mark1><br>
Who with mock patience dire complaints <mark4>endure,</mark4><br>
Which real pain, and that alone, can <mark3>cure;</mark3><br>
How would ye bear in real pain to <mark3>lie,</mark3><br>
Despised, neglected, left alone to <mark3>die?</mark3><br>
How would ye bear to draw your latest <mark4>breath,</mark4><br>
Where all that's wretched paves the way for <mark3>death?</mark3><br>
Such is that room which one rude beam <mark4>divides,</mark4><br>
And naked rafters form the sloping <mark3>sides;</mark3><br>
Where the vile bands that bind the thatch are <mark1>seen,</mark1><br>
And lath and mud is all that lie <mark3>between;</mark3><br>
Save one dull pane, that, coarsely patched, gives <mark1>way</mark1><br>
To the rude tempest, yet excludes the <mark1>day.</mark1><br>
Here, on a matted flock, with dust <mark4>o'erspread,</mark4><br>
The drooping wretch reclines his languid <mark4>head;</mark4><br>
For him no hand the cordial cup <mark4>applies,</mark4><br>
Nor wipes the tear that stagnates in his <mark1>eyes;</mark1><br>
No friends with soft discourse his pain <mark4>beguile,</mark4><br>
Nor promise hope till sickness wears a <mark3>smile.</mark3><br>
But soon a loud and hasty summons <mark4>calls,</mark4><br>
Shakes the thin roof, and echoes round the <mark3>walls.</mark3><br>
Anon, a figure enters, quaintly <mark4>neat,</mark4><br>
All pride and business, bustle and <mark3>conceit;</mark3><br>
With looks unaltered by these scenes of <mark1>woe,</mark1><br>
With speed that, entering, speaks his haste to <mark1>go,</mark1><br>
He bids the gazing throng around him <mark1>fly,</mark1><br>
And carries fate and physic in his <mark1>eye;</mark1><br>
A potent quack, long versed in human <mark4>ills,</mark4><br>
Who first insults the victim whom he <mark3>kills;</mark3><br>
Whose murd'rous hand a drowsy bench <mark4>protect,</mark4><br>
And whose most tender mercy is <mark3>neglect.</mark3><br>
Paid by the parish for attendance <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
He wears contempt upon his sapient <mark4>sneer;</mark4><br>
In haste he seeks the bed where misery <mark4>lies,</mark4><br>
Impatience marked in his averted <mark1>eyes;</mark1><br>
And, some habitual queries hurried <mark1>o'er,</mark1><br>
Without reply, he rushes on the <mark1>door:</mark1><br>
His drooping patient, long inured to <mark1>pain,</mark1><br>
And long unheeded, knows remonstrance <mark1>vain;</mark1><br>
He ceases now the feeble help to <mark4>crave</mark4><br>
Of man, and mutely hastens to the <mark3>grave.</mark3><br>
But ere his death some pious doubts <mark4>arise,</mark4><br>
Some simple <mark4>fears</mark4>, which "bold bad" men <mark3>despise;</mark3><br>
Fain would he ask the parish priest to <mark4>prove</mark4><br>
His title certain to the joys <mark4>above;</mark4><br>
For this he sends the murmuring nurse, who <mark1>calls</mark1><br>
The holy stranger to these dismal <mark1>walls;</mark1><br>
And doth not he, the pious man, <mark4>appear,</mark4><br>
He, "passing rich with forty pounds a <mark3>year"?</mark3><br>
Ah! no; a shepherd of a different <mark5>stock,</mark5><br>
And far unlike him, feeds this little <mark3>flock:</mark3><br>
A jovial youth, who thinks his Sunday's <mark4>task</mark4><br>
As much as God or man can fairly <mark3>ask;</mark3><br>
The rest he gives to loves and labors <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
To fields the morning and to feasts the <mark3>night;</mark3><br>
None better skilled the noisy pack to <mark4>guide,</mark4><br>
To urge their chase, to cheer them or to <mark3>chide;</mark3><br>
Sure in his <mark4>shot</mark4>, his game he seldom <mark4>missed,</mark4><br>
And seldom failed to win his game at whist;<br>
Then, while such honors bloom around his <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
Shall he sit sadly by the sick man's <mark1>bed</mark1><br>
To raise the hope he feels not, or with <mark4>zeal</mark4><br>
To combat fears that ev'n the pious <mark1>feel</mark1><br>
Now once again the gloomy scene <mark1>explore,</mark1><br>
Less gloomy now; the bitter hour is <mark1>o'er,</mark1><br>
The man of many sorrows sighs no <mark1>more.</mark1><br>
Up yonder hill, behold how sadly <mark3>slow</mark3><br>
The bier moves winding from the vale <mark1>below;</mark1><br>
There lie the happy dead, from trouble <mark1>free,</mark1><br>
And the glad parish pays the frugal <mark3>fee.</mark3><br>
No <mark4>more</mark4>, oh Death! thy victim starts to <mark4>hear</mark4><br>
Churchwarden stern, or kingly <mark4>overseer;</mark4><br>
No more the farmer gets his humble <mark3>bow,</mark3><br>
Thou art his lord, the best of tyrants <mark3>thou!</mark3><br>
Now to the church behold the mourners <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
Sedately torpid and devoutly <mark3>dumb;</mark3><br>
The village children now their games <mark4>suspend,</mark4><br>
To see the bier that bears their ancient <mark3>friend:</mark3><br>
For he was one in all their idle <mark4>sport,</mark4><br>
And like a monarch ruled their little <mark3>court;</mark3><br>
The pliant bow he formed, the flying <mark1>ball,</mark1><br>
The bat, the wicket, were his labours <mark3>all;</mark3><br>
Him now they follow to his grave, and <mark1>stand</mark1><br>
Silent and sad, and gazing, hand in <mark1>hand;</mark1><br>
While bending low, their eager eyes <mark1>explore</mark1><br>
The mingled relics of the parish <mark1>poor.</mark1><br>
The bell tolls late, the moping owl flies <mark4>round,</mark4><br>
Fear marks the flight and magnifies the <mark3>sound;</mark3><br>
The busy priest, detained by weightier <mark1>care,</mark1><br>
Defers his duty till the day of <mark1>prayer;</mark1><br>
And, waiting long, the crowd retire <mark4>distressed,</mark4><br>
To think a poor man's bones should lie unblessed.<br>
