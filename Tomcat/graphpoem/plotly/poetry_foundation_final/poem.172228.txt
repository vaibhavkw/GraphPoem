Title : Words <br>
Author : Barbara Guest <br><br>

The simple contact with a wooden spoon and the <mark1>word</mark1><br>
recovered itself, began to spread as grass, <mark4>forced</mark4><br>
as it lay sprawling to consider the monument where   <br>
patience looked at grief, where warfare <mark4>ceased</mark4><br>
eyes curled outside themes to search the <mark4>paper</mark4><br>
now gleaming and potent, wise and resilient, <mark1>word</mark1><br>
entered its continent eager to find another <mark4>as</mark4><br>
capable as a thorn. The nearest possession <mark4>would</mark4><br>
house them both, they being then two might <mark4>glide</mark4><br>
into this house and presently create a rather <mark4>larger</mark4><br>
mansion filled with spoons and <mark4>condiments</mark4>, <mark4>gracious</mark4><br>
as a newly laid table where related objects might <mark4>gather</mark4><br>
to enjoy the interplay of gravity upon facetious <mark4>hints,</mark4><br>
the chocolate dish presuming an endowment, the ladle   <br>
of galactic rhythm primed as a relish dish, <mark4>curved</mark4><br>
knives, finger bowls, morsel carriages words <mark4>might</mark4><br>
choose and savor before swallowing so much was the   <br>
sumptuousness and substance of a rented house where <mark4>words</mark4><br>
placed dressing gowns as rosemary entered their <mark4>scent</mark4><br>
percipient as elder branches in the night where <mark1>words</mark1><br>
gathered, warped, then straightened, marking new <mark4>wands.</mark4><br>
