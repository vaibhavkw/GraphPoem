Title : In Heaven <br>
Author : Stephen Crane <br><br>

<br>
In <mark4>Heaven,</mark4><br>
Some little blades of grass<br>
Stood before <mark4>God.</mark4><br>
"What did you <mark1>do?"</mark1><br>
Then all save one of the little <mark4>blades</mark4><br>
Began eagerly to relate<br>
The merits of their <mark4>lives.</mark4><br>
This one stayed a small way <mark4>behind</mark4><br>
Presently God <mark4>said:</mark4><br>
<br>
"And what did you <mark1>do?"</mark1><br>
The little blade answered: "Oh, my <mark4>lord,</mark4><br>
"Memory is bitter to me<br>
"For if I did good <mark4>deeds</mark4><br>
"I know not of them."<br>
Then God in all His splendor<br>
Arose from His <mark4>throne.</mark4><br>
"Oh, best little blade of grass," He <mark1>said.</mark1><br>
