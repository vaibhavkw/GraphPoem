Title : Song to Amarantha, that she would Dishevel her Hair <br>
Author : Richard Lovelace <br><br>

Amarantha sweet and <mark3>fair</mark3><br>
Ah braid no more that shining <mark3>hair!</mark3><br>
As my curious hand or <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
Hovering round thee let it <mark3>fly.</mark3><br>
<br>
      Let it fly as unconfin'd<br>
As its calm ravisher, the <mark4>wind,</mark4><br>
      Who hath left his darling th'East,<br>
To wanton o'er that spicy <mark3>nest.</mark3><br>
<br>
      Ev'ry tress must be confest<br>
But neatly tangled at the <mark3>best;</mark3><br>
Like a clue of golden <mark4>thread,</mark4><br>
Most excellently ravelled.<br>
<br>
Do not then wind up that <mark4>light</mark4><br>
In ribands, and o'er-cloud in <mark3>night;</mark3><br>
Like the sun in's early <mark3>ray,</mark3><br>
But shake your head and scatter <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
<br>
See 'tis broke! Within this <mark4>grove</mark4><br>
The bower, and the walks of <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
Weary lie we down and <mark4>rest,</mark4><br>
And fan each other's panting <mark3>breast.</mark3><br>
<br>
Here we'll strip and cool our <mark4>fire</mark4><br>
In cream below, in milk-baths <mark3>higher:</mark3><br>
And when all wells are drawn <mark3>dry,</mark3><br>
I'll drink a tear out of thine <mark1>eye,</mark1><br>
<br>
Which our very joys shall <mark4>leave</mark4><br>
That sorrows thus we can <mark3>deceive;</mark3><br>
Or our very sorrows <mark3>weep,</mark3><br>
That joys so <mark4>ripe</mark4>, so little <mark3>keep.</mark3><br>
