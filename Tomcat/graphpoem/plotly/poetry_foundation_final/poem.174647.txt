Title : from The Princess: Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the <mark4>white;</mark4><br>
Nor waves the cypress in the palace <mark4>walk;</mark4><br>
Nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry <mark4>font.</mark4><br>
The firefly wakens; waken thou with <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
<br>
Now droops the milk-white peacock like a <mark4>ghost,</mark4><br>
And like a ghost she glimmers on to <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
<br>
Now lies the Earth all Danae to the <mark4>stars,</mark4><br>
And all thy heart lies open unto <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
<br>
Now slides the silent meteor on, and <mark4>leaves</mark4><br>
A shining furrow, as thy thoughts in <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
<br>
Now folds the lily all her sweetness <mark4>up,</mark4><br>
And slips into the bosom of the <mark4>lake.</mark4><br>
So fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and <mark4>slip</mark4><br>
Into my bosom and be lost in <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
