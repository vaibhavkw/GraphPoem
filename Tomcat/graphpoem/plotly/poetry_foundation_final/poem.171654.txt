Title : The Best Game the Fairies Play <br>
Author : Rose Fyleman <br><br>

The best game the fairies play, <br>
The best game of <mark3>all,</mark3><br>
Is sliding down <mark4>steeples--</mark4><br>
(You know they're very <mark3>tall).</mark3><br>
You fly to the weathercock, <br>
And when you hear it <mark3>crow,</mark3><br>
You fold your wings and clutch your <mark4>things</mark4><br>
And then let <mark3>go!</mark3><br>
They have a million other <mark4>games--</mark4><br>
Cloud-catching's <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
And mud-mixing after <mark4>rain</mark4><br>
Is heaps and heaps of <mark4>fun;</mark4><br>
But when you go and stay with them <br>
Never mind the <mark3>rest,</mark3><br>
Take my advice--they're very nice, <br>
But steeple-sliding's <mark3>best!</mark3><br>
