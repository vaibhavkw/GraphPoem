Title : Protus <br>
Author : Robert Browning <br><br>

Among these latter busts we count by <mark4>scores,</mark4><br>
Half-emperors and <mark4>quarter-emperors,</mark4><br>
Each with his bay-leaf fillet, loose-thonged <mark3>vest,</mark3><br>
Loric and low-browed Gorgon on the <mark3>breast,?</mark3><br>
One loves a baby face, with violets <mark3>there,</mark3><br>
Violets instead of laurel in the <mark3>hair,</mark3><br>
As those were all the little locks could <mark3>bear.</mark3><br>
<br>
Now read here. "Protus ends a <mark4>period</mark4><br>
"Of empery beginning with a <mark4>god;</mark4><br>
"Born in the porphyry chamber at Byzant,<br>
"Queens by his cradle, proud and ministrant:<br>
"And if he quickened breath <mark4>there</mark4>, 't would like <mark4>fire</mark4><br>
"Pantingly through the dim vast realm <mark3>transpire.</mark3><br>
"A fame that he was missing, spread <mark4>afar:</mark4><br>
"The world, from its four corners, rose in <mark4>war,</mark4><br>
"Till he was borne out on a <mark4>balcony</mark4><br>
"To pacify the world when it should see.<br>
"The captains ranged before him, one, his <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
"Made baby points at, gained the chief <mark3>command.</mark3><br>
"And day by day more beautiful he <mark3>grew</mark3><br>
"In shape, all said, in feature and in <mark3>hue,</mark3><br>
"While young Greek sculptors gazing on the <mark4>child</mark4><br>
"Became, with old Greek sculpture, <mark4>reconciled.</mark4><br>
"Already sages laboured to <mark4>condense</mark4><br>
"In easy tomes a life's <mark4>experience:</mark4><br>
"And artists took grave counsel to <mark4>impart</mark4><br>
"In one breath and one hand-sweep, all their <mark3>art-</mark3><br>
"To make his graces prompt as <mark4>blossoming</mark4><br>
"Of plentifully-watered palms in <mark4>spring:</mark4><br>
"Since well beseems it, whoso mounts the <mark3>throne,</mark3><br>
"For beauty, knowledge, strength, should stand <mark3>alone,</mark3><br>
"And mortals love the letters of his <mark3>name."</mark3><br>
<br>
-Stop! Have you turned two pages? Still the <mark3>same.</mark3><br>
New reign, same date. The scribe goes on to <mark3>say</mark3><br>
How that same year, on such a month and <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
"John the Pannonian, groundedly <mark4>believed</mark4><br>
"A blacksmith's bastard, whose hard hand reprieved<br>
"The Empire from its fate the year <mark3>before,-</mark3><br>
"Came, had a mind to take the crown, and <mark3>wore</mark3><br>
"The same for six years, (during which the Huns<br>
"Kept off their fingers from us) till his <mark4>sons</mark4><br>
"Put something in his liquor "-and so <mark4>forth.</mark4><br>
Then a new reign. Stay-"Take at its just worth <mark4>"</mark4><br>
(Subjoins an annotator) "what I <mark3>give</mark3><br>
"As hearsay. Some think, John let Protus <mark3>live</mark3><br>
"And slip away. 'T is said, he reached man's <mark3>age</mark3><br>
"At some blind northern court; made, first a <mark3>page,</mark3><br>
"Then tutor to the children; last, of <mark4>use</mark4><br>
"About the hunting stables. I <mark3>deduce</mark3><br>
"He wrote the little tract 'On worming <mark4>dogs,'</mark4><br>
"Whereof the name in sundry <mark4>catalogues</mark4><br>
"Is extant yet. A Protus of the <mark4>race</mark4><br>
"Is rumoured to have died a monk in Thrace,-<br>
"And, if the same, he reached <mark4>senility."</mark4><br>
<br>
Here's John the Smith's rough-hammered head. Great eye,<br>
Gross jaw and griped lips do what granite <mark4>can</mark4><br>
To give you the crown-grasper. What a <mark3>man!</mark3><br>
