Title : Indian Boarding School: The Runaways <br>
Author : Louise Erdrich <br><br>

Home's the place we head for in our sleep.   <br>
Boxcars stumbling north in <mark4>dreams</mark4><br>
don't wait for us. We catch them on the run.   <br>
The rails, old lacerations that we love,   <br>
shoot parallel across the face and <mark4>break</mark4><br>
just under Turtle <mark4>Mountains</mark4>, Riding <mark4>scars</mark4><br>
you can't get lost. Home is the place they <mark4>cross.</mark4><br>
<br>
The lame guard strikes a match and makes the <mark4>dark</mark4><br>
less tolerant. We watch through cracks in <mark4>boards</mark4><br>
as the land starts rolling, rolling till it <mark4>hurts</mark4><br>
to be here, cold in regulation <mark4>clothes.</mark4><br>
We know the sheriff's waiting at midrun <br>
to take us back. His car is dumb and warm. <br>
The highway doesn't rock, it only <mark4>hums</mark4><br>
like a wing of long insults. The worn-down welts   <br>
of ancient punishments lead back and forth. <br>
<br>
All runaways wear <mark4>dresses</mark4>, long green <mark4>ones,</mark4><br>
the color you would think shame was. We scrub   <br>
the sidewalks down because it's shameful <mark4>work.</mark4><br>
Our brushes cut the stone in watered <mark4>arcs</mark4><br>
and in the soak frail outlines shiver clear <br>
a moment, things us kids pressed on the <mark1>dark</mark1><br>
face before it hardened, pale, remembering <br>
delicate old <mark4>injuries</mark4>, the spines of names and <mark4>leaves.</mark4><br>
