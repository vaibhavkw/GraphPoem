Title : Fragment 6: The Moon, how definite its orb! <br>
Author : Samuel Taylor Coleridge <br><br>

<br>
The Moon, how definite its orb!<br>
Yet gaze again, and with a steady gaze?<br>
'Tis there indeed,?but where is it <mark4>not??</mark4><br>
It is suffused o'er all the sapphire <mark4>Heaven,</mark4><br>
Trees, herbage, snake-like stream, unwrinkled <mark3>Lake,</mark3><br>
Whose very murmur does of it <mark3>partake</mark3><br>
And low and close the broad smooth <mark4>mountain</mark4><br>
Is more a thing of Heaven than <mark4>when</mark4><br>
Distinct by one dim shade and yet undivided from the universal cloud<br>
In which it towers, finite in <mark4>height.</mark4><br>
