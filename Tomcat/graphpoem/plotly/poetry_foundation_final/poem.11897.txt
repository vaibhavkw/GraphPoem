Title : Parting: 1940<br>
Author : John Frederick Nims<br><br>

Not knowing in what season this <mark3>again</mark3><br>
Not knowing when again the arms outyearning   <br>
Nor the flung smile in eyes not knowing <mark3>when</mark3><br>
<br>
Not sure beyond all doubt of full <mark4>return</mark4><br>
Not sure of time now nor the film's reversal   <br>
This all done opposite, the waif regathered <br>
<br>
Like our lost parents in the blinded <mark4>song</mark4><br>
We bag in hand with wandering steps and slow   <br>
Through suburbs take our solitary way <br>
<br>
Not that all clouds are garrisoned and <mark4>stung</mark4><br>
Not that horizons loom with coppered <mark4>legions</mark4><br>
Not that the year is dark with weird <mark4>condition</mark4><br>
<br>
All who parted in all days looked back <br>
Saw the white face, the waving. And saw the sea   <br>
Not knowing in what season this <mark1>again</mark1><br>
<br>
For well they knew, the parters in all <mark4>evenings</mark4><br>
Druid and Roman and the rocked <mark4>Phoenician:</mark4><br>
The blood flows one imposed way, and no other<br>
