Title : Poem with One Fact <br>
Author : Donald Hall <br><br>

"At pet stores in Detroit, you can <mark5>buy</mark5><br>
frozen <mark1>rats</mark1><br>
for seventy-five cents apiece, to <mark4>feed</mark4><br>
your pet boa <mark4>constrictor"</mark4><br>
back home in Grosse <mark4>Pointe,</mark4><br>
or in Grosse Pointe Park, <br>
<br>
while the free nation of <mark1>rats</mark1><br>
in Detroit <mark4>emerges</mark4><br>
from alleys behind pet shops, from <mark4>cellars</mark4><br>
and junked <mark4>cars</mark4>, and <mark4>gathers</mark4><br>
to flow at <mark4>twilight</mark4><br>
like a river the color of <mark4>pavement,</mark4><br>
<br>
and crawls over bedrooms and <mark4>groceries</mark4><br>
and through <mark4>broken</mark4><br>
school windows to eat the <mark4>crayon</mark4><br>
from drawings of <mark1>rats--</mark1><br>
and no one in Detroit <mark4>understands</mark4><br>
how rats are delicious in <mark4>Dearborn.</mark4><br>
<br>
If only we could communicate, if <mark4>only</mark4><br>
the boa constrictors of <mark4>Southfield</mark4><br>
would slither down I-94, <br>
turn north on the Lodge Expressway,   <br>
and head for Eighth <mark3>Street</mark3>, to <mark4>eat</mark4><br>
out for a change. Instead, tomorrow, <br>
<br>
a man from Birmingham <mark4>enters</mark4><br>
a pet shop in <mark4>Detroit</mark4><br>
to buy a frozen German <mark4>shepherd</mark4><br>
for six dollars and fifty <mark4>cents</mark4><br>
to feed his pet cheetah, <br>
guarding the compound at <mark4>home.</mark4><br>
<br>
Oh, they arrive all day, in their   <br>
locked cars, <mark5>buying</mark5><br>
schoolyards, <mark4>bridges</mark4>, <mark4>buses,</mark4><br>
<mark4>churches</mark4>, and Ethnic <mark4>Festivals;</mark4><br>
they buy a frozen Texaco <mark4>station</mark4><br>
for eighty-four dollars and fifty <mark1>cents</mark1><br>
<br>
to feed to an imported London <mark4>taxi</mark4><br>
in Huntington <mark4>Woods;</mark4><br>
they buy Tiger <mark4>Stadium,</mark4><br>
frozen, to feed to the Little League   <br>
in Grosse Ile. They bring <mark4>everything</mark4><br>
home, frozen <mark4>solid</mark4><br>
<br>
as pig iron, to the six-car <mark4>garages</mark4><br>
of Harper <mark1>Woods</mark1>, Grosse Pointe <mark1>Woods,</mark1><br>
Farmington, Grosse <mark1>Pointe</mark1><br>
Farms, Troy, and Grosse <mark4>Arbor--</mark4><br>
and they <mark4>ingest</mark4><br>
everything, and fall asleep, and <mark3>lie</mark3><br>
<br>
coiled in the sun, while the <mark4>city</mark4><br>
thaws in the stomach and <mark4>slides</mark4><br>
to the small intestine, where <mark4>enzymes</mark4><br>
break down molecules of <mark4>protein</mark4><br>
to amino acids, which <mark4>enter</mark4><br>
the cold <mark4>bloodstream.</mark4><br>
