Title : The Day Lady Died <br>
Author : Frank O'Hara <br><br>

It is 12:20 in New York a Friday <br>
three days after Bastille day, <mark4>yes</mark4><br>
it is 1959 and I go get a <mark4>shoeshine</mark4><br>
because I will get off the 4:19 in Easthampton   <br>
at 7:15 and then go straight to <mark3>dinner</mark3><br>
and I don't know the people who will feed me <br>
<br>
I walk up the muggy street beginning to <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
and have a hamburger and a malted and buy <br>
an ugly NEW WORLD WRITING to see what the <mark4>poets</mark4><br>
in Ghana are doing these days <br>
                                                        I go on to the bank <br>
and Miss Stillwagon (first name Linda I once <mark4>heard)</mark4><br>
doesn't even look up my balance for once in her life   <br>
and in the GOLDEN GRIFFIN I get a little <mark1>Verlaine</mark1><br>
for Patsy with drawings by Bonnard although I do   <br>
think of Hesiod, trans. Richmond Lattimore <mark3>or</mark3><br>
Brendan Behan's new play or Le Balcon or Les Negres <br>
of Genet, but I don't, I stick with <mark1>Verlaine</mark1><br>
after practically going to sleep with quandariness <br>
<br>
and for Mike I just stroll into the PARK <mark4>LANE</mark4><br>
Liquor Store and ask for a bottle of Strega <mark4>and</mark4><br>
then I go back where I came from to 6th Avenue   <br>
and the tobacconist in the Ziegfeld Theatre <mark1>and</mark1><br>
casually ask for a carton of Gauloises and a <mark4>carton</mark4><br>
of Picayunes, and a NEW YORK POST with her face on <mark4>it</mark4><br>
<br>
and I am sweating a lot by now and thinking of <br>
leaning on the john door in the 5 <mark4>SPOT</mark4><br>
while she whispered a song along the <mark4>keyboard</mark4><br>
to Mal Waldron and everyone and I stopped breathing<br>
