Title : Spaces We Leave Empty <br>
Author : Cathy Song <br><br>

The jade slipped from my wrist   <br>
with the smoothness of <mark4>water</mark4><br>
leaving the <mark4>mountains,</mark4><br>
<br>
silk falling from a <mark4>shoulder,</mark4><br>
melon slices sliding across the <mark4>tongue,</mark4><br>
the fish <mark4>returning.</mark4><br>
<br>
The bracelet worn since my first birthday   <br>
cracked into thousand-year-old <mark4>eggshells.</mark4><br>
The sound could be <mark4>heard</mark4><br>
ringing across the <mark1>water</mark1><br>
<br>
where my mother woke in her sleep crying thief.   <br>
Her nightgown slapped in the <mark4>wind</mark4><br>
as he howled clutching his <mark4>hoard.</mark4><br>
<br>
The cultured <mark4>pearls.</mark4><br>
The bone flutes. <br>
The peppermint disks of <mark4>jade.</mark4><br>
<br>
The clean hole <br>
in the center, Heaven:   <br>
the spaces we left empty.<br>
