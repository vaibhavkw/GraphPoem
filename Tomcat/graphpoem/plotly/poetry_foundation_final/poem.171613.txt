Title : Why We Are Truly a Nation <br>
Author : William Matthews <br><br>

Because we rage inside <br>
the old <mark4>boundaries,</mark4><br>
like a young girl leaving the Church,   <br>
scared of her <mark4>parents.</mark4><br>
<br>
Because we all dream of saving   <br>
the shaggy, dung-caked buffalo,   <br>
shielding the herd with our <mark4>bodies.</mark4><br>
<br>
Because grief unites <mark4>us,</mark4><br>
like the locked antlers of <mark4>moose</mark4><br>
who die on their knees in <mark4>pairs.</mark4><br>
