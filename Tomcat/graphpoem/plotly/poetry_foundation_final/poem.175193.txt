Have any of you, passers-by,<br>
Had an old tooth that was an unceasing <mark4>discomfort?</mark4><br>
Or a pain in the side that never quite left you?<br>
Or a malignant growth that grew with time?<br>
So that even in profoundest slumber<br>
There was shadowy consciousness or the phantom of <mark4>thought</mark4><br>
Of the tooth, the side, the growth?<br>
Even so thwarted love, or defeated ambition,<br>
Or a blunder in life which mixed your life<br>
Hopelessly to the <mark4>end,</mark4><br>
Will like a tooth, or a pain in the <mark4>side,</mark4><br>
Float through your dreams in the final sleep<br>
Till perfect freedom from the earth-sphere<br>
Comes to you as one who wakes<br>
Healed and glad in the morning!<br>
