Title : Holy Sonnets: If poisonous minerals, and if that tree <br>
Author : John Donne <br><br>

If poisonous minerals, and if that <mark3>tree</mark3><br>
Whose fruit threw death on else immortal <mark4>us,</mark4><br>
If lecherous <mark4>goats</mark4>, if serpents <mark4>envious</mark4><br>
Cannot be damn'd, alas, why should I <mark3>be?</mark3><br>
Why should intent or reason, born in <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
Make sins, else equal, in me more <mark4>heinous?</mark4><br>
And mercy being easy, and <mark4>glorious</mark4><br>
To God, in his stern wrath why threatens <mark3>he?</mark3><br>
But who am I, that dare dispute with <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
O God? Oh, of thine only worthy <mark3>blood</mark3><br>
And my tears, make a heavenly Lethean <mark3>flood,</mark3><br>
And drown in it my sins' black <mark4>memory.</mark4><br>
That thou remember them, some claim as <mark3>debt;</mark3><br>
I think it mercy, if thou wilt <mark3>forget.</mark3><br>
