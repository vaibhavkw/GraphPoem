Title : To a Gentleman and Lady on the Death of the Lady's Brother and Sister, and a Child of the Name Avis, Aged One Year <br>
Author : Phillis Wheatley <br><br>

On Death's domain intent I fix my <mark3>eyes,</mark3><br>
Where human nature in vast ruin <mark3>lies,</mark3><br>
With pensive mind I search the drear <mark4>abode,</mark4><br>
Where the great conqu'ror has his spoils <mark4>bestow'd;</mark4><br>
There there the offspring of six thousand <mark4>years</mark4><br>
In endless numbers to my view <mark3>appears:</mark3><br>
Whole kingdoms in his gloomy den are <mark3>thrust,</mark3><br>
And nations mix with their primeval <mark3>dust:</mark3><br>
Insatiate still he gluts the ample <mark4>tomb;</mark4><br>
His is the present, his the age to <mark4>come</mark4><br>
See here a brother, here a sister <mark4>spread,</mark4><br>
And a sweet daughter mingled with the <mark3>dead.</mark3><br>
<br>
But, Madam, let your grief be laid <mark4>aside,</mark4><br>
And let the fountain of your tears be <mark4>dry'd,</mark4><br>
In vain they flow to wet the dusty <mark3>plain,</mark3><br>
Your sighs are wafted to the skies in <mark3>vain,</mark3><br>
Your pains they witness, but they can no <mark3>more,</mark3><br>
While Death reigns tyrant o'er this mortal <mark3>shore.</mark3><br>
<br>
The glowing stars and silver queen of <mark4>light</mark4><br>
At last must perish in the gloom of <mark3>night:</mark3><br>
Resign thy friends to that Almighty <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
Which gave them life, and bow to his <mark3>command;</mark3><br>
Thine Avis give without a murm'ring <mark4>heart,</mark4><br>
Though half thy soul be fated to <mark3>depart.</mark3><br>
To shining guards consign thine infant <mark4>care</mark4><br>
To waft triumphant through the seas of <mark3>air:</mark3><br>
Her soul enlarg'd to heav'nly pleasure <mark4>springs,</mark4><br>
She feeds on truth and uncreated <mark3>things.</mark3><br>
Methinks I hear her in the realms <mark5>above,</mark5><br>
And leaning forward with a filial <mark3>love,</mark3><br>
Invite you there to share immortal <mark3>bliss</mark3><br>
Unknown, untasted in a state like <mark3>this.</mark3><br>
With tow'ring hopes, and growing grace <mark4>arise,</mark4><br>
And seek beatitude beyond the <mark3>skies.</mark3><br>
