Title : Sonnet 107: Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul <br>
Author : William Shakespeare <br><br>

Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic <mark3>soul</mark3><br>
Of the wide world dreaming on things to <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
Can yet the lease of my true love <mark3>control,</mark3><br>
Suppos'd as forfeit to a confin'd <mark4>doom.</mark4><br>
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd <br>
And the sad augurs mock their own <mark4>presage;</mark4><br>
Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd <br>
And peace proclaims olives of endless <mark4>age.</mark4><br>
Now with the drops of this most balmy <mark4>time</mark4><br>
My love looks fresh, and Death to me <mark3>subscribes,</mark3><br>
Since, spite of <mark4>him</mark4>, I'll live in this poor <mark3>rhyme,</mark3><br>
While he insults o'er dull and speechless <mark3>tribes;</mark3><br>
And thou in this shalt find thy <mark4>monument,</mark4><br>
When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are <mark4>spent.</mark4><br>
