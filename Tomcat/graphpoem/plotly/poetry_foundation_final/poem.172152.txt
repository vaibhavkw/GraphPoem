Title : Six Sailors <br>
Author : Irving Feldman <br><br>

to Pete <mark4>Foss,</mark4><br>
God give him good berth!<br>
Shipped deckhand June of <mark4>'fifty-one</mark4><br>
aboard the freighter Willis <mark4>Kerrigan,</mark4><br>
chartered to Union Sulphur and <mark4>Oil</mark4><br>
(stack colors dull ochre, <mark4>black)</mark4><br>
and carrying coal from Norfolk <mark4>out</mark4><br>
to Dunkerque, France on the Marshall <mark4>Plan</mark4><br>
?old Liberty de-mothballed in Baltimore, <br>
shaken down, painted over, and <mark4>papered</mark4><br>
with a pickup crew, scourings of the <mark4>seven</mark4><br>
saloons of Hoboken, Mobile, Camden, Pedro.<br>
<br>
Here we are, bosun, carpenter, watches. <mark4>Jake,</mark4><br>
Cox, Wally, Slim, Chips, the Finn, <mark4>myself,</mark4><br>
Ole, Moe, Chris the Dane, Pete Foss, bosun, <br>
average sorts of monster, more or <mark4>less:</mark4><br>
brawler or bragger, wino, nut, nag, <br>
bully, slob, simpleton, <mark4>thief,</mark4><br>
this carp of leaden <mark4>contempt,</mark4><br>
this john aspiring to <mark4>mackerel,</mark4><br>
these sponge, crab, <mark5>clam,</mark5><br>
bottom-feeders almost to a <mark4>man,</mark4><br>
lungless on land, finless <mark4>afloat,</mark4><br>
sifting the margin of <mark4>muck</mark4><br>
with sodden sense and cramping <mark4>gut.</mark4><br>
Adrift in wide iron <mark5>belly</mark5><br>
amid tall waves always at world edge, <br>
sailors are liable to <mark4>misadventure</mark4><br>
into monstrosity, <mark4>forgotten</mark4><br>
elsewhere, lost to <mark4>themselves.</mark4><br>
<br>
mutiny, storms at sea, <mark4>quarreling</mark4><br>
drunks, fistfights, a broken <mark3>screw</mark3>, <mark3>two</mark3><br>
stowaways, a crewman's fiddle stolen, <mark4>heaved</mark4><br>
overboard or hocked, kangaroo court and <mark3>Moe</mark3><br>
condemned to dine alone for dirtiness, <br>
Wally of the middle watch busting <mark4>open</mark4><br>
lockers, out three days slugging hair <mark4>tonic,</mark4><br>
shaving lotion, as if the stuff were <mark3>scotch,</mark3><br>
Lulu and a second whore <mark5>clambering</mark5><br>
over the barges and hustled <mark3>below</mark3><br>
before the ship had ever touched a <mark4>dock.</mark4><br>
These the adventures, nothing <mark4>legendary,</mark4><br>
just "adventures," nothing more, <mark4>anecdotes</mark4><br>
from someone else's <mark4>less-than-war.</mark4><br>
<br>
our common peaceable <mark4>humanity's</mark4><br>
old routine: chipping gunwale <mark4>rust</mark4><br>
soogeeing the wheelhouse down, bow <mark3>watch</mark3><br>
under the stars, the coffee pot <mark4>perking</mark4><br>
day and night, the binnacle's <mark4>hypnotic</mark4><br>
click-click-click, meals and <mark4>meals</mark4>, <mark4>cards</mark4><br>
in the mess, Pete Foss' lined face pokered <br>
around his pipe, sunning out on the <mark4>hatches,</mark4><br>
winch work, fire <mark1>drill</mark1>, boat <mark4>drill,</mark4><br>
endless talk of sex, endless <mark4>trivial</mark4><br>
housekeeping chores of homeless <mark4>householders</mark4><br>
wandering on the wide wide sea, <mark1>sleep</mark1><br>
in the throbbing, rolling, roaring, yawing, shivering tub.<br>
<br>
Each from his isolation, <mark4>each</mark4><br>
from transmogrification,<br>
his little <mark4>pleasure</mark4><br>
or lengthy <mark1>sleep,</mark1><br>
a sudden gracing <mark4>woke;</mark4><br>
the mast, our common <mark4>labor,</mark4><br>
a confluence of task and wave, <br>
of waves blown into <mark4>wind,</mark4><br>
the one the pure transparent day <br>
brought us there <mark4>together.</mark4><br>
At the infinitesimal inter-<br>
section of these historic <mark4>enterprises,</mark4><br>
commercial, <mark4>national</mark4>, <mark4>imperial,</mark4><br>
within an indefinable <mark4>cosmic</mark4><br>
context, six of us climbed the mainmast<br>
with beaknosed hammers, buckets of <mark4>paint</mark4><br>
to scrape it clean, to make it <mark3>new.</mark3><br>
Gulls dove, dolphins <mark4>rolled,</mark4><br>
sun swam ahead on the sea, <br>
and we wind-jockeys on bosun <mark4>chairs</mark4><br>
in our thrilled <mark4>community</mark4><br>
let lines go and flew, out <mark4>around</mark4><br>
the dancing lodgepole of the turning sky <br>
that first and dazzling morning of the <mark4>world.</mark4><br>
