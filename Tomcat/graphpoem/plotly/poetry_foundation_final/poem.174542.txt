Title : Ave Atque Vale <br>
Author : Algernon Charles Swinburne <br><br>

In Memory of Charles Baudelaire  Nous devrions pourtant lui porter quelques fleurs; Les morts, les pauvres morts, ont de grandes douleurs, Et quand Octobre souffle, emondeur des vieux arbres, Son vent melancolique a l'entour de leurs marbres, Certe, ils doivent trouver les vivants bien ingrats.  Les Fleurs du <mark4>Mal.</mark4><br>
<br>
Shall I strew on thee rose or rue or <mark4>laurel,</mark4><br>
Brother, on this that was the veil of <mark3>thee?</mark3><br>
Or quiet sea-flower moulded by the <mark3>sea,</mark3><br>
Or simplest growth of meadow-sweet or <mark3>sorrel,</mark3><br>
Such as the summer-sleepy Dryads <mark3>weave,</mark3><br>
Waked up by snow-soft sudden rains at <mark3>eve?</mark3><br>
Or wilt thou rather, as on earth <mark3>before,</mark3><br>
Half-faded fiery blossoms, pale with <mark3>heat</mark3><br>
And full of bitter summer, but more <mark3>sweet</mark3><br>
To thee than gleanings of a northern <mark3>shore</mark3><br>
Trod by no tropic <mark3>feet?</mark3><br>
<br>
For always thee the fervid languid <mark4>glories</mark4><br>
Allured of heavier suns in mightier <mark4>skies;</mark4><br>
Thine ears knew all the wandering watery <mark3>sighs</mark3><br>
Where the sea sobs round Lesbian promontories, <br>
The barren kiss of piteous wave to <mark4>wave</mark4><br>
That knows not where is that Leucadian <mark3>grave</mark3><br>
Which hides too deep the supreme head of <mark3>song.</mark3><br>
      Ah, salt and sterile as her kisses were, <br>
The wild sea winds her and the green gulfs <mark4>bear</mark4><br>
Hither and thither, and vex and work her <mark3>wrong,</mark3><br>
Blind gods that cannot <mark3>spare.</mark3><br>
Thou sawest, in thine old singing season, <mark3>brother,</mark3><br>
<br>
Secrets and sorrows unbeheld of <mark4>us:</mark4><br>
Fierce loves, and lovely leaf-buds <mark4>poisonous,</mark4><br>
Bare to thy subtler eye, but for none <mark3>other</mark3><br>
      Blowing by night in some unbreathed-in clime; <br>
The hidden harvest of luxurious <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
Sin without shape, and pleasure without <mark3>speech;</mark3><br>
And where strange dreams in a tumultuous <mark3>sleep</mark3><br>
Make the shut eyes of stricken spirits <mark3>weep;</mark3><br>
And with each face thou sawest the shadow on <mark3>each,</mark3><br>
Seeing as men sow men <mark3>reap.</mark3><br>
O sleepless heart and sombre soul unsleeping, <br>
That were athirst for sleep and no more <mark3>life</mark3><br>
<br>
And no more love, for peace and no more <mark3>strife!</mark3><br>
Now the dim gods of death have in their <mark4>keeping</mark4><br>
Spirit and body and all the springs of <mark1>song,</mark1><br>
Is it well now where love can do no <mark1>wrong,</mark1><br>
Where stingless pleasure has no foam or <mark4>fang</mark4><br>
Behind the unopening closure of her <mark4>lips?</mark4><br>
Is it not well where soul from body <mark3>slips</mark3><br>
And flesh from bone divides without a <mark3>pang</mark3><br>
As dew from flower-bell <mark3>drips?</mark3><br>
It is enough; the end and the <mark4>beginning</mark4><br>
Are one thing to thee, who art past the <mark3>end.</mark3><br>
O hand unclasped of unbeholden <mark3>friend,</mark3><br>
<br>
For thee no fruits to pluck, no palms for <mark3>winning,</mark3><br>
No triumph and no labour and no <mark4>lust,</mark4><br>
Only dead yew-leaves and a little <mark3>dust.</mark3><br>
O quiet eyes wherein the light saith nought, <br>
Whereto the day is dumb, nor any <mark4>night</mark4><br>
With obscure finger silences your <mark3>sight,</mark3><br>
Nor in your speech the sudden soul speaks <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
Sleep, and have sleep for <mark4>light.</mark4><br>
Now all strange hours and all strange loves are <mark4>over,</mark4><br>
Dreams and desires and sombre songs and <mark1>sweet,</mark1><br>
Hast thou found place at the great knees and <mark1>feet</mark1><br>
Of some pale Titan-woman like a <mark4>lover,</mark4><br>
<br>
Such as thy vision here <mark4>solicited,</mark4><br>
Under the shadow of her fair vast <mark4>head,</mark4><br>
The deep division of prodigious <mark4>breasts,</mark4><br>
The solemn slope of mighty limbs <mark3>asleep,</mark3><br>
The weight of awful tresses that still <mark3>keep</mark3><br>
The savour and shade of old-world <mark4>pine-forests</mark4><br>
Where the wet hill-winds <mark1>weep?</mark1><br>
Hast thou found any likeness for thy <mark3>vision?</mark3><br>
O gardener of strange flowers, what bud, what <mark4>bloom,</mark4><br>
Hast thou found sown, what gathered in the <mark3>gloom?</mark3><br>
What of despair, of rapture, of <mark3>derision,</mark3><br>
What of life is there, what of ill or <mark4>good?</mark4><br>
<br>
Are the fruits grey like dust or bright like <mark4>blood?</mark4><br>
Does the dim ground grow any seed of <mark4>ours,</mark4><br>
The faint fields quicken any terrene <mark4>root,</mark4><br>
In low lands where the sun and moon are <mark3>mute</mark3><br>
And all the stars keep silence? Are there <mark3>flowers</mark3><br>
At all, or any <mark3>fruit?</mark3><br>
Alas, but though my flying song flies <mark4>after,</mark4><br>
O sweet strange elder singer, thy more <mark4>fleet</mark4><br>
Singing, and footprints of thy fleeter <mark1>feet,</mark1><br>
Some dim derision of mysterious <mark3>laughter</mark3><br>
From the blind tongueless warders of the <mark4>dead,</mark4><br>
Some gainless glimpse of Proserpine's veiled <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
<br>
Some little sound of unregarded <mark4>tears</mark4><br>
Wept by effaced unprofitable <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
And from pale mouths some cadence of dead sighs <mark1>--</mark1><br>
These only, these the hearkening spirit <mark4>hears,</mark4><br>
Sees only such things <mark4>rise.</mark4><br>
Thou art far too far for wings of words to <mark3>follow,</mark3><br>
Far too far off for thought or any <mark4>prayer.</mark4><br>
What ails us with thee, who art wind and <mark3>air?</mark3><br>
What ails us gazing where all seen is <mark3>hollow?</mark3><br>
Yet with some fancy, yet with some <mark4>desire,</mark4><br>
Dreams pursue death as winds a flying <mark3>fire,</mark3><br>
Our dreams pursue our dead and do not <mark4>find.</mark4><br>
<br>
Still, and more swift than they, the thin flame <mark3>flies,</mark3><br>
The low light fails us in elusive <mark1>skies,</mark1><br>
Still the foiled earnest ear is deaf, and <mark3>blind</mark3><br>
Are still the eluded <mark1>eyes.</mark1><br>
Not thee, O never thee, in all time's <mark4>changes,</mark4><br>
Not thee, but this the sound of thy sad <mark4>soul,</mark4><br>
The shadow of thy swift spirit, this shut <mark3>scroll</mark3><br>
I lay my hand on, and not death estranges <br>
My spirit from communion of thy song <mark1>--</mark1><br>
These memories and these melodies that <mark3>throng</mark3><br>
Veiled porches of a Muse funereal -- <br>
These I salute, these touch, these clasp and <mark4>fold</mark4><br>
<br>
As though a hand were in my hand to <mark3>hold,</mark3><br>
Or through mine ears a mourning <mark4>musical</mark4><br>
Of many mourners <mark3>rolled.</mark3><br>
I among these, I also, in such <mark4>station</mark4><br>
      As when the pyre was charred, and piled the sods, <br>
And offering to the dead made, and their <mark4>gods,</mark4><br>
The old mourners had, standing to make libation, <br>
I <mark4>stand</mark4>, and to the gods and to the <mark1>dead</mark1><br>
Do reverence without prayer or praise, and <mark3>shed</mark3><br>
Offering to these unknown, the gods of <mark1>gloom,</mark1><br>
And what of honey and spice my seedlands <mark1>bear,</mark1><br>
And what I may of fruits in this chilled <mark1>air,</mark1><br>
<br>
And lay, Orestes-like, across the <mark3>tomb</mark3><br>
A curl of severed <mark3>hair.</mark3><br>
But by no hand nor any treason <mark4>stricken,</mark4><br>
Not like the low-lying head of Him, the <mark4>King,</mark4><br>
The flame that made of Troy a ruinous <mark3>thing,</mark3><br>
Thou liest, and on this dust no tears could <mark3>quicken</mark3><br>
There fall no tears like theirs that all men <mark4>hear</mark4><br>
Fall tear by sweet imperishable <mark4>tear</mark4><br>
Down the opening leaves of holy poets' <mark4>pages.</mark4><br>
Thee not <mark4>Orestes</mark4>, not Electra <mark4>mourns;</mark4><br>
      But bending us-ward with memorial urns <br>
The most high Muses that fulfil all <mark4>ages</mark4><br>
<br>
Weep, and our God's heart <mark4>yearns.</mark4><br>
For, sparing of his sacred strength, not <mark4>often</mark4><br>
Among us darkling here the lord of <mark1>light</mark1><br>
Makes manifest his music and his <mark3>might</mark3><br>
In hearts that open and in lips that <mark3>soften</mark3><br>
With the soft flame and heat of songs that <mark4>shine.</mark4><br>
Thy lips indeed he touched with bitter <mark3>wine,</mark3><br>
And nourished them indeed with bitter <mark3>bread;</mark3><br>
Yet surely from his hand thy soul's food <mark4>came,</mark4><br>
The fire that scarred thy spirit at his <mark3>flame</mark3><br>
Was <mark4>lighted</mark4>, and thine hungering heart he <mark3>fed</mark3><br>
Who feeds our hearts with <mark3>fame.</mark3><br>
<br>
Therefore he too now at thy soul's <mark5>sunsetting,</mark5><br>
God of all suns and songs, he too bends <mark4>down</mark4><br>
To mix his laurel with thy cypress <mark3>crown,</mark3><br>
And save thy dust from blame and from <mark4>forgetting.</mark4><br>
Therefore he too, seeing all thou wert and <mark4>art,</mark4><br>
<mark4>Compassionate</mark4>, with sad and sacred <mark3>heart,</mark3><br>
Mourns thee of many his children the last <mark1>dead,</mark1><br>
And hallows with strange tears and alien <mark1>sighs</mark1><br>
Thine unmelodious mouth and sunless <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
And over thine irrevocable <mark1>head</mark1><br>
Sheds light from the under <mark1>skies.</mark1><br>
And one weeps with him in the ways Lethean, <br>
<br>
And stains with tears her changing bosom <mark4>chill:</mark4><br>
That obscure Venus of the hollow <mark3>hill,</mark3><br>
That thing transformed which was the Cytherean, <br>
With lips that lost their Grecian laugh <mark4>divine</mark4><br>
      Long since, and face no more called Erycine; <br>
A ghost, a bitter and luxurious <mark4>god.</mark4><br>
Thee also with fair flesh and singing <mark4>spell</mark4><br>
Did she, a sad and second prey, <mark3>compel</mark3><br>
Into the footless places once more <mark3>trod,</mark3><br>
And shadows hot from <mark3>hell.</mark3><br>
And now no sacred staff shall break in <mark4>blossom,</mark4><br>
No choral salutation lure to <mark1>light</mark1><br>
<br>
A spirit sick with perfume and sweet <mark1>night</mark1><br>
And love's tired eyes and hands and barren <mark4>bosom.</mark4><br>
There is no help for these things; none to <mark4>mend</mark4><br>
And none to mar; not all our songs, O <mark1>friend,</mark1><br>
Will make death clear or make life <mark4>durable.</mark4><br>
Howbeit with rose and ivy and wild <mark3>vine</mark3><br>
And with wild notes about this dust of <mark3>thine</mark3><br>
At least I fill the place where white dreams <mark4>dwell</mark4><br>
And wreathe an unseen <mark3>shrine.</mark3><br>
Sleep; and if life was bitter to thee, <mark4>pardon,</mark4><br>
If sweet, give thanks; thou hast no more to <mark4>live;</mark4><br>
And to give thanks is good, and to <mark3>forgive.</mark3><br>
<br>
Out of the mystic and the mournful <mark3>garden</mark3><br>
Where all day through thine hands in barren <mark4>braid</mark4><br>
Wove the sick flowers of secrecy and <mark3>shade,</mark3><br>
Green buds of sorrow and sin, and remnants <mark3>grey,</mark3><br>
Sweet-smelling, pale with poison, <mark4>sanguine-hearted,</mark4><br>
Passions that sprang from sleep and thoughts that <mark3>started,</mark3><br>
Shall death not bring us all as thee one <mark3>day</mark3><br>
Among the days <mark3>departed?</mark3><br>
For thee, O now a silent soul, my <mark1>brother,</mark1><br>
Take at my hands this garland, and <mark3>farewell.</mark3><br>
Thin is the leaf, and chill the wintry <mark3>smell,</mark3><br>
And chill the solemn earth, a fatal <mark3>mother,</mark3><br>
<br>
With sadder than the Niobean <mark4>womb,</mark4><br>
And in the hollow of her breasts a <mark1>tomb.</mark1><br>
Content thee, howsoe'er, whose days are <mark4>done;</mark4><br>
There lies not any troublous thing <mark1>before,</mark1><br>
Nor sight nor sound to war against thee <mark3>more,</mark3><br>
For whom all winds are quiet as the <mark3>sun,</mark3><br>
All waters as the <mark1>shore.</mark1><br>
