Title : Love (II) <br>
Author : George Herbert <br><br>

Immortal Heat, O let Thy greater <mark3>flame</mark3><br>
Attract the lesser to it; let those <mark3>fires</mark3><br>
Which shall consume the world first make it <mark3>tame,</mark3><br>
And kindle in our hearts such true <mark3>desires.</mark3><br>
As may consume our lusts, and make Thee <mark3>way:</mark3><br>
Then shall our hearts pant Thee, then shall our <mark3>brain</mark3><br>
All her invention on Thine altar <mark3>lay,</mark3><br>
And there in hymns send back Thy fire <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
Our eyes shall see Thee, which before saw <mark3>dust,</mark3><br>
Dust blown by wit, till that they both were <mark3>blind:</mark3><br>
Thou shalt recover all Thy goods in <mark3>kind,</mark3><br>
Who wert disseized by usurping <mark3>lust:</mark3><br>
All knees shall bow to Thee; all wits shall <mark4>rise,</mark4><br>
And praise Him Who did make and mend our <mark3>eyes.</mark3><br>
