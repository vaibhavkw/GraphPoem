Title : The Cradle Logic of Autumn <br>
Author : Jay Wright <br><br>

En mi pais el Otono nace de una flor seca,  de algunos pajaros; . . . o del vaho penetrante de ciertos rios de la llanura.  --Molinari, "Oda a una larga tristeza" <br>
Each instant comes with a price, the blue-edged <mark3>bill</mark3><br>
on the draft of a bird almost incarnadine,   <br>
the shanked ochre of an inn that sits as <mark3>still</mark3><br>
as the beavertail cactus it guards (the <mark3>fine</mark3><br>
rose of that flower gone as bronze as <mark3>sand),</mark3><br>
the river's chalky white insistence as <mark4>it</mark4><br>
moves past the gray afternoon toward <mark4>sunset.</mark4><br>
Autumn feels the chill of a late summer <mark4>lit</mark4><br>
only by goldenrod and a misplaced <mark3>strand</mark3><br>
of blackberries; deplores all such sleight of <mark3>hand;</mark3><br>
turns sullen, selfish, envious, full of <mark4>regret.</mark4><br>
<br>
Someone more adept would mute its voice. The <mark3>spill</mark3><br>
of its truncated experience would <mark3>shine</mark3><br>
less bravely and, out of the dust and dunghill   <br>
of this existence (call it hope, in <mark3>decline),</mark3><br>
as here the blue light of autumn falls, <mark3>command</mark3><br>
what is left of exhilaration and <mark4>fit</mark4><br>
this season's unfolding to the <mark4>alphabet</mark4><br>
of turn and counterturn, all that <mark4>implicit</mark4><br>
arc of a heart searching for a place to <mark3>stand.</mark3><br>
Yet even that diminished voice can <mark3>withstand</mark3><br>
the currying of its <mark4>spirit</mark4>, Here lies--not <mark4>yet.</mark4><br>
<br>
If, and only if, the leafless rose he <mark3>sees,</mark3><br>
or thinks he sees, flowered a moment <mark3>ago,</mark3><br>
this endangered heart flows with the river that <mark3>flees</mark3><br>
the plain, and listens with eye raised to the <mark3>slow</mark3><br>
revelation of cloud, hoping to <mark5>approve</mark5><br>
himself, or to admonish the rose for <mark4>slight</mark4><br>
transgressions of the past, this the <mark3>ecstatic</mark3><br>
ethos, a logic that seems set to reprove   <br>
his facility with unsettling <mark3>delight.</mark3><br>
Autumn might be only desire, a Twelfth <mark3>Night</mark3><br>
gone awry, a gift almost too <mark3>emphatic.</mark3><br>
<br>
Logic in a faithful light somehow <mark5>appeases</mark5><br>
the rose, and stirs the hummingbird's vibrato.   <br>
By moving, I can stand where the light <mark4>eases</mark4><br>
me into the river's feathered arms, and, <mark3>so,</mark3><br>
with the heat of my devotion, again <mark3>prove</mark3><br>
devotion, if not this moment, pure, <mark4>finite.</mark4><br>
Autumn cradles me with <mark3>idiomatic</mark3><br>
certainty, leaves me nothing to <mark3>disapprove.</mark3><br>
I now acknowledge this red moon, to requite   <br>
the heart alone given power to <mark4>recite</mark4><br>
its faith, what a cradled life finds <mark3>emblematic.</mark3><br>
