Title : I Am a Parcel of Vain Strivings Tied <br>
Author : Henry David Thoreau <br><br>

I am a parcel of vain strivings <mark3>tied</mark3><br>
By a chance bond <mark3>together,</mark3><br>
Dangling this way and that, their <mark4>links</mark4><br>
Were made so loose and <mark3>wide,</mark3><br>
<br>
For milder <mark3>weather.</mark3><br>
<br>
A bunch of violets without their <mark4>roots,</mark4><br>
And sorrel <mark3>intermixed,</mark3><br>
Encircled by a wisp of <mark3>straw</mark3><br>
Once coiled about their <mark3>shoots,</mark3><br>
The <mark3>law</mark3><br>
By which I'm <mark3>fixed.</mark3><br>
<br>
A nosegay which Time clutched from <mark4>out</mark4><br>
Those fair Elysian <mark3>fields,</mark3><br>
With weeds and broken stems, in <mark4>haste,</mark4><br>
Doth make the rabble <mark4>rout</mark4><br>
That <mark4>waste</mark4><br>
The day he <mark3>yields.</mark3><br>
<br>
And here I bloom for a short hour <mark3>unseen,</mark3><br>
Drinking my juices <mark3>up,</mark3><br>
With no root in the <mark4>land</mark4><br>
To keep my branches <mark3>green,</mark3><br>
But <mark3>stand</mark3><br>
In a bare <mark3>cup.</mark3><br>
<br>
Some tender buds were left upon my <mark3>stem</mark3><br>
In mimicry of <mark3>life,</mark3><br>
But ah! the children will not <mark3>know,</mark3><br>
Till time has withered <mark3>them,</mark3><br>
The <mark3>woe</mark3><br>
With which they're <mark3>rife.</mark3><br>
<br>
But now I see I was not plucked for <mark4>naught,</mark4><br>
And after in life's <mark4>vase</mark4><br>
Of glass set while I might survive,<br>
But by a kind hand <mark3>brought</mark3><br>
<br>
To a strange <mark3>place.</mark3><br>
<br>
That stock thus thinned will soon redeem its <mark4>hours,</mark4><br>
And by another <mark4>year,</mark4><br>
Such as God knows, with freer <mark4>air,</mark4><br>
More fruits and fairer <mark3>flowers</mark3><br>
Will <mark3>bear,</mark3><br>
While I droop <mark4>here.</mark4><br>
