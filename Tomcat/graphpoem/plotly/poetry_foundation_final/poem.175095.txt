Title : Attempted Assassination of the Queen <br>
Author : Knight of the White Elephant of Burmah William McGonagall <br><br>

God prosper long our noble <mark4>Queen,</mark4><br>
And long may she <mark4>reign!</mark4><br>
Maclean he tried to shoot <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
But it was all in <mark3>vain.</mark3><br>
<br>
For God He turned the ball <mark4>aside</mark4><br>
Maclean aimed at her <mark4>head;</mark4><br>
And he felt very <mark4>angry</mark4><br>
Because he didn't shoot her <mark3>dead.</mark3><br>
<br>
There's a divinity that hedges a <mark5>king,</mark5><br>
And so it does <mark5>seem,</mark5><br>
And my opinion is, it has <mark4>hedged</mark4><br>
Our most gracious <mark1>Queen.</mark1><br>
<br>
Maclean must be a <mark4>madman,</mark4><br>
Which is obvious to be <mark4>seen,</mark4><br>
Or else he wouldn't have tried to shoot <br>
Our most beloved <mark1>Queen.</mark1><br>
<br>
Victoria is a good <mark1>Queen,</mark1><br>
       Which all her subjects know, <br>
And for that God has protected <mark1>her</mark1><br>
From all her deadly <mark4>foes.</mark4><br>
<br>
She is noble and <mark4>generous,</mark4><br>
Her subjects must <mark4>confess;</mark4><br>
There hasn't been her <mark4>equal</mark4><br>
Since the days of good Queen <mark3>Bess.</mark3><br>
<br>
Long may she be spared to <mark4>roam</mark4><br>
Among the bonnie Highland <mark4>floral,</mark4><br>
And spend many a happy <mark1>day</mark1><br>
In the palace of <mark3>Balmoral.</mark3><br>
<br>
Because she is very <mark4>kind</mark4><br>
To the old women <mark3>there,</mark3><br>
And allows them bread, tea, and <mark4>sugar,</mark4><br>
And each one to get a <mark3>share.</mark3><br>
<br>
And when they know of her <mark4>coming,</mark4><br>
       Their hearts feel overjoy'd, <br>
Because, in general, she finds work <br>
For men that's <mark4>unemploy'd.</mark4><br>
<br>
And she also gives the gipsies <mark4>money</mark4><br>
While at Balmoral, I've been <mark4>told,</mark4><br>
And, mind ye, seldom <mark4>silver,</mark4><br>
But very often <mark3>gold.</mark3><br>
<br>
I hope God will protect <mark1>her</mark1><br>
By night and by <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
At home and <mark4>abroad,</mark4><br>
When she's far <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
<br>
May He be as a hedge around <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
As He's been all <mark4>along,</mark4><br>
And let her live and die in <mark4>peace</mark4><br>
Is the end of my <mark3>song.</mark3><br>
