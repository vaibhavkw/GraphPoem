Title : Say not the Struggle nought Availeth <br>
Author : Arthur Hugh Clough <br><br>

Say not the struggle nought availeth, <br>
The labour and the wounds are <mark3>vain,</mark3><br>
The enemy faints not, nor faileth, <br>
And as things have been they <mark3>remain.</mark3><br>
<br>
If hopes were dupes, fears may be <mark3>liars;</mark3><br>
It may be, in yon smoke <mark3>concealed,</mark3><br>
Your comrades chase e'en now the <mark3>fliers,</mark3><br>
And, but for you, possess the <mark3>field.</mark3><br>
<br>
For while the tired waves, vainly <mark3>breaking</mark3><br>
Seem here no painful inch to <mark3>gain,</mark3><br>
Far back through creeks and inlets <mark3>making,</mark3><br>
Came, silent, flooding <mark4>in</mark4>, the <mark3>main.</mark3><br>
<br>
And not by eastern windows <mark4>only,</mark4><br>
When daylight comes, comes in the <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
In front the sun climbs slow, how <mark4>slowly,</mark4><br>
But westward, look, the land is <mark3>bright.</mark3><br>
