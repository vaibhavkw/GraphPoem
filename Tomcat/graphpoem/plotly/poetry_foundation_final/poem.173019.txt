Title : Love among the Ruins <br>
Author : Robert Browning <br><br>

Where the quiet-coloured end of evening <mark3>smiles,</mark3><br>
Miles and <mark3>miles</mark3><br>
On the solitary pastures where our <mark4>sheep</mark4><br>
<br>
Tinkle homeward thro' the twilight, stray or <mark4>stop</mark4><br>
As they <mark3>crop?</mark3><br>
Was the site once of a city great and <mark3>gay,</mark3><br>
(So they <mark3>say)</mark3><br>
Of our country's very capital, its <mark3>prince</mark3><br>
Ages <mark3>since</mark3><br>
Held his court in, gathered councils, wielding <mark4>far</mark4><br>
Peace or <mark4>war.</mark4><br>
<br>
Now the country does not even boast a <mark3>tree,</mark3><br>
As you <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
To distinguish slopes of verdure, certain rills<br>
From the <mark4>hills</mark4><br>
Intersect and give a name to, (else they <mark3>run</mark3><br>
Into <mark3>one)</mark3><br>
Where the domed and daring palace shot its <mark4>spires</mark4><br>
Up like <mark3>fires</mark3><br>
O'er the hundred-gated circuit of a <mark3>wall</mark3><br>
Bounding <mark3>all</mark3><br>
Made of marble, men might march on nor be <mark3>prest</mark3><br>
Twelve <mark3>abreast.</mark3><br>
<br>
And such plenty and perfection, see, of <mark4>grass</mark4><br>
Never <mark4>was!</mark4><br>
Such a carpet as, this summer-time, <mark4>o'er-spreads</mark4><br>
And <mark5>embeds</mark5><br>
Every vestige of the city, guessed <mark4>alone,</mark4><br>
Stock or <mark3>stone?</mark3><br>
Where a multitude of men breathed joy and <mark3>woe</mark3><br>
Long <mark3>ago;</mark3><br>
Lust of glory pricked their hearts up, dread of <mark3>shame</mark3><br>
Struck them <mark3>tame;</mark3><br>
And that glory and that shame alike, the <mark3>gold</mark3><br>
Bought and <mark3>sold.</mark3><br>
<br>
Now?the single little turret that <mark4>remains</mark4><br>
On the <mark3>plains,</mark3><br>
By the caper overrooted, by the <mark4>gourd</mark4><br>
<br>
While the patching houseleek's head of blossom <mark4>winks</mark4><br>
Through the <mark3>chinks?</mark3><br>
Marks the basement whence a tower in ancient <mark4>time</mark4><br>
Sprang <mark3>sublime,</mark3><br>
And a burning ring, all round, the chariots <mark4>traced</mark4><br>
As they <mark3>raced,</mark3><br>
And the monarch and his minions and his <mark4>dames</mark4><br>
Viewed the <mark3>games.</mark3><br>
<br>
And I know, while thus the quiet-coloured <mark3>eve</mark3><br>
Smiles to <mark3>leave</mark3><br>
To their folding, all our many-tinkling <mark4>fleece</mark4><br>
In such <mark3>peace,</mark3><br>
And the slopes and rills in undistinguished <mark3>grey</mark3><br>
Melt <mark3>away?</mark3><br>
That a girl with eager eyes and yellow <mark4>hair</mark4><br>
Waits me <mark3>there</mark3><br>
In the turret whence the charioteers caught <mark4>soul</mark4><br>
For the <mark3>goal,</mark3><br>
When the king looked, where she looks now, breathless, <mark4>dumb</mark4><br>
Till I <mark3>come.</mark3><br>
<br>
But he looked upon the city, every <mark4>side,</mark4><br>
Far and <mark3>wide,</mark3><br>
All the mountains topped with <mark4>temples</mark4>, all the <mark4>glades'</mark4><br>
<br>
All the causeys, bridges, aqueducts,?and <mark4>then</mark4><br>
All the <mark3>men!</mark3><br>
When I do come, she will speak not, she will <mark4>stand,</mark4><br>
Either <mark3>hand</mark3><br>
On my shoulder, give her eyes the first <mark4>embrace</mark4><br>
Of my <mark3>face,</mark3><br>
Ere we rush, ere we extinguish sight and <mark3>speech</mark3><br>
Each on <mark3>each.</mark3><br>
<br>
In one year they sent a million fighters <mark3>forth</mark3><br>
South and <mark3>North,</mark3><br>
And they built their gods a brazen pillar <mark3>high</mark3><br>
As the <mark3>sky</mark3><br>
Yet reserved a thousand chariots in full <mark4>force?</mark4><br>
Gold, of <mark3>course.</mark3><br>
O heart! oh blood that <mark4>freezes</mark4>, blood that <mark4>burns!</mark4><br>
Earth's <mark3>returns</mark3><br>
For whole centuries of folly, noise and <mark4>sin!</mark4><br>
Shut them <mark3>in,</mark3><br>
With their triumphs and their glories and the <mark4>rest!</mark4><br>
Love is <mark3>best.</mark3><br>
