Title : Hole, Where Once in Passion We Swam <br>
Author : Dave Smith <br><br>

The sun frets, a fat wafer falling like a trap of failed mesh.<br>
I watch the pin-glare of a mockingbird's eye cut sharply, <mark4>descend</mark4><br>
on the blank water, then emerge from himself <mark4>naked</mark4><br>
as a girl who shimmered here, once, for me.<br>
<br>
If we come back like penitents to kneel over water, bass <mark4>swirling,</mark4><br>
scattering the mayflies that often, in silence, <mark4>graze</mark4><br>
<br>
lips, what is the word floating out from the mouth <mark4>unbearable</mark4><br>
as a bird's black grin or a madman's <mark4>lust?</mark4><br>
<br>
The word is not we, but me. Giving it again and <mark4>again</mark4><br>
<br>
brings no one out of the willows and I, willing to believe <br>
like a sap in whatever dives or rises hear no voice <br>
but the mist sizzling on stones. I lift my <mark4>head</mark4><br>
<br>
for echoes out of trees, for the flashed recoil of flesh <mark4>hung</mark4><br>
cheap and gaudy, wingless, above the stab of <mark4>water</mark4><br>
that crunched her like a beer can. Toads honk<br>
<br>
the only answer. Among them, a boy, I <mark4>felt</mark4><br>
<br>
the grotesque pull of the moon all night, peeled and went slowly <br>
down in terror, rising, falling through the pulpy <mark4>leaves</mark4><br>
until the sun caught me, drained, and I was no <mark4>one</mark4><br>
wanted, so walked away from all <mark4>knowing,</mark4><br>
<br>
walked into town and drank, calmly, an illegal beer, then <mark4>slept.</mark4><br>
<br>
The hooks, in hairy hands, clawed it smooth as a dish, a <mark4>super-</mark4><br>
human search by flood and fire light. What could they <mark4>find?</mark4><br>
Like many, I have been out of town a long time.<br>
<br>
I wish the face floating above the chill at my knees <mark4>opened</mark4><br>
the door of a drab <mark3>hotel</mark3>, I wish it said Go to <mark4>hell</mark4><br>
or Do you know what time it is, <mark4>anything</mark4><br>
<br>
that, if I heard it, I could kneel to and swear to be <mark4>faithful.</mark4><br>
