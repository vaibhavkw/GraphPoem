Title : Crossing Brooklyn Ferry <br>
Author : Walt Whitman <br><br>

<br>
Flood-tide below me! I see you face to <mark1>face!</mark1><br>
Clouds of the west--sun there half an hour high--I see you also face to <mark1>face.</mark1><br>
<br>
Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, how curious you are to <mark1>me!</mark1><br>
On the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning home, are more curious to me than you <mark1>suppose,</mark1><br>
And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more to me, and more in my <mark4>meditations</mark4>, than you might <mark1>suppose.</mark1><br>
<br>
The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
The simple, compact, well-join'd scheme, myself disintegrated, every one disintegrated yet part of the <mark4>scheme,</mark4><br>
The similitudes of the past and those of the <mark4>future,</mark4><br>
The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings, on the walk in the street and the passage over the <mark4>river,</mark4><br>
The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
The others that are to follow me, the ties between me and <mark4>them,</mark4><br>
The certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of <mark4>others.</mark4><br>
Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to <mark4>shore,</mark4><br>
<br>
Others will watch the run of the <mark3>flood-tide,</mark3><br>
Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and <mark4>west</mark4>, and the heights of Brooklyn to the south and <mark4>east,</mark4><br>
Others will see the islands large and <mark3>small;</mark3><br>
Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half an hour high, <br>
A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others will see <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the <mark3>flood-tide</mark3>, the falling-back to the sea of the <mark3>ebb-tide.</mark3><br>
It avails <mark1>not</mark1>, time nor place--distance avails <mark4>not,</mark4><br>
<br>
I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many generations <mark4>hence,</mark4><br>
Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I <mark4>felt,</mark4><br>
Just as any of you is one of a living <mark1>crowd</mark1>, I was one of a <mark4>crowd,</mark4><br>
Just as you are refresh'd by the gladness of the river and the bright flow, I was <mark4>refresh'd,</mark4><br>
Just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift current, I stood yet was <mark4>hurried,</mark4><br>
Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the thick-stemm'd pipes of steamboats, I <mark4>look'd.</mark4><br>
I too many and many a time cross'd the river of <mark4>old,</mark4><br>
Watched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls, saw them high in the air floating with motionless <mark4>wings</mark4>, oscillating their <mark4>bodies,</mark4><br>
<br>
Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left the rest in strong shadow, <br>
Saw the slow-wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the <mark5>south,</mark5><br>
Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the <mark4>water,</mark4><br>
Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of <mark4>beams,</mark4><br>
Look'd at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head in the sunlit <mark1>water,</mark1><br>
Look'd on the haze on the hills southward and <mark4>south-westward,</mark4><br>
Look'd on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with <mark4>violet,</mark4><br>
Look'd toward the lower bay to notice the vessels <mark4>arriving,</mark4><br>
Saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships at <mark4>anchor,</mark4><br>
The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars, <br>
The round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender serpentine <mark4>pennants,</mark4><br>
The large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their <mark4>pilot-houses,</mark4><br>
The white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the <mark4>wheels,</mark4><br>
The flags of all nations, the falling of them at <mark4>sunset,</mark4><br>
The scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the frolicsome crests and <mark4>glistening,</mark4><br>
The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls of the granite storehouses by the <mark4>docks,</mark4><br>
On the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flank'd on each side by the barges, the hay-boat, the belated <mark4>lighter,</mark4><br>
On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high and glaringly into the <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow light over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of <mark4>streets.</mark4><br>
These and all else were to me the same as they are to <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
I loved well those cities, loved well the stately and rapid <mark1>river,</mark1><br>
<br>
The men and women I saw were all near to <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Others the same--others who look back on me because I look'd forward to <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
(The time will come, though I stop here to-day and <mark3>to-night.)</mark3><br>
What is it then between <mark4>us?</mark4><br>
What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between <mark1>us?</mark1><br>
Whatever it is, it avails not--distance avails <mark1>not</mark1>, and place avails <mark1>not,</mark1><br>
<br>
I too lived, Brooklyn of ample hills was <mark4>mine,</mark4><br>
I too walk'd the streets of Manhattan island, and bathed in the waters around <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
<br>
In the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
In my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they came upon <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
I too had been struck from the float forever held in <mark4>solution,</mark4><br>
I too had receiv'd identity by my <mark5>body,</mark5><br>
That I was I knew was of my <mark1>body</mark1>, and what I should be I knew I should be of my <mark1>body.</mark1><br>
It is not upon you alone the dark patches <mark3>fall,</mark3><br>
The dark threw its patches down upon me <mark1>also,</mark1><br>
The best I had done seem'd to me blank and <mark4>suspicious,</mark4><br>
My great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre? <br>
<br>
Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be <mark4>evil,</mark4><br>
I am he who knew what it was to be <mark1>evil,</mark1><br>
I too knitted the old knot of contrariety, <br>
Blabb'd, blush'd, resented, lied, stole, grudg'd, <br>
Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not <mark4>speak,</mark4><br>
Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, <mark4>malignant,</mark4><br>
The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
The cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not <mark4>wanting,</mark4><br>
Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these <mark1>wanting,</mark1><br>
Was one with the <mark1>rest</mark1>, the days and haps of the <mark4>rest,</mark4><br>
Was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me approaching or <mark4>passing,</mark4><br>
Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as I <mark4>sat,</mark4><br>
Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet never told them a <mark4>word,</mark4><br>
Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, <mark4>gnawing</mark4>, <mark4>sleeping,</mark4><br>
Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or <mark4>actress,</mark4><br>
The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we <mark4>like,</mark4><br>
Or as small as we like, or both great and <mark1>small.</mark1><br>
Closer yet I approach <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
What thought you have of me now, I had as much of you--I laid in my stores in <mark4>advance,</mark4><br>
<br>
I consider'd long and seriously of you before you were <mark4>born.</mark4><br>
Who was to know what should come home to <mark1>me?</mark1><br>
Who knows but I am enjoying <mark4>this?</mark4><br>
<br>
Who knows, for all the distance, but I am as good as looking at you now, for all you cannot see <mark1>me?</mark1><br>
Ah, what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than mast-hemm'd <mark4>Manhattan?</mark4><br>
River and sunset and scallop-edg'd waves of <mark1>flood-tide?</mark1><br>
The sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the twilight, and the belated <mark1>lighter?</mark1><br>
<br>
What gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and with voices I love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as I approach? <br>
What is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that looks in my <mark1>face?</mark1><br>
Which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into <mark1>you?</mark1><br>
<br>
We understand then do we <mark1>not?</mark1><br>
What I promis'd without mentioning it, have you not <mark4>accepted?</mark4><br>
What the study could not teach--what the preaching could not accomplish is accomplish'd, is it <mark1>not?</mark1><br>
Flow on, river! flow with the <mark3>flood-tide</mark3>, and ebb with the <mark1>ebb-tide!</mark1><br>
<br>
Frolic on, crested and scallop-edg'd <mark4>waves!</mark4><br>
Gorgeous clouds of the sunset! drench with your splendor <mark1>me</mark1>, or the men and women generations after <mark1>me!</mark1><br>
Cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of <mark4>passengers!</mark4><br>
<br>
Stand up, tall masts of Mannahatta! stand up, beautiful hills of <mark4>Brooklyn!</mark4><br>
Throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and <mark4>answers!</mark4><br>
Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of <mark1>solution!</mark1><br>
<br>
Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house or street or public <mark4>assembly!</mark4><br>
Sound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically call me by my nighest <mark4>name!</mark4><br>
Live, old life! play the part that looks back on the actor or <mark1>actress!</mark1><br>
Play the old role, the role that is great or small according as one makes <mark1>it!</mark1><br>
Consider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in unknown ways be looking upon <mark1>you;</mark1><br>
Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet haste with the hasting <mark4>current;</mark4><br>
Fly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in the <mark4>air;</mark4><br>
Receive the summer sky, you water, and faithfully hold it till all downcast eyes have time to take it from <mark1>you!</mark1><br>
Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any one's head, in the sunlit <mark1>water!</mark1><br>
<br>
Come on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, white-sail'd schooners, sloops, <mark4>lighters!</mark4><br>
Flaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower'd at <mark1>sunset!</mark1><br>
Burn high your <mark4>fires</mark4>, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at nightfall! cast red and yellow light over the tops of the <mark4>houses!</mark4><br>
Appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you <mark3>are,</mark3><br>
You necessary film, continue to envelop the <mark4>soul,</mark4><br>
About my body for me, and your body for you, be hung out divinest <mark4>aromas,</mark4><br>
Thrive, cities--bring your freight, bring your <mark4>shows</mark4>, ample and sufficient <mark4>rivers,</mark4><br>
Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more <mark4>spiritual,</mark4><br>
Keep your places, objects than which none else is more <mark4>lasting.</mark4><br>
You have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful <mark4>ministers,</mark4><br>
We receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate <mark5>henceforward,</mark5><br>
<br>
Not you any more shall be able to foil <mark1>us</mark1>, or withhold yourselves from <mark1>us,</mark1><br>
We use you, and do not cast you aside--we plant you permanently within <mark1>us,</mark1><br>
We fathom you not--we love you--there is perfection in you <mark1>also,</mark1><br>
You furnish your parts toward <mark4>eternity,</mark4><br>
Great or <mark4>small</mark4>, you furnish your parts toward the <mark1>soul.</mark1><br>
