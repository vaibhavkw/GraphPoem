Title : Porphyria's Lover <br>
Author : Robert Browning <br><br>

The rain set early in <mark3>to-night,</mark3><br>
The sullen wind was soon <mark3>awake,</mark3><br>
It tore the elm-tops down for <mark3>spite,</mark3><br>
And did its worst to vex the <mark3>lake:</mark3><br>
I listened with heart fit to <mark3>break.</mark3><br>
When glided in Porphyria; <mark4>straight</mark4><br>
She shut the cold out and the <mark3>storm,</mark3><br>
And kneeled and made the cheerless <mark3>grate</mark3><br>
Blaze up, and all the cottage <mark3>warm;</mark3><br>
Which done, she rose, and from her <mark3>form</mark3><br>
Withdrew the dripping cloak and <mark3>shawl,</mark3><br>
And laid her soiled gloves by, <mark3>untied</mark3><br>
Her hat and let the damp hair <mark3>fall,</mark3><br>
And, last, she sat down by my <mark3>side</mark3><br>
And called me. When no voice <mark3>replied,</mark3><br>
She put my arm about her <mark4>waist,</mark4><br>
And made her smooth white shoulder <mark3>bare,</mark3><br>
And all her yellow hair <mark3>displaced,</mark3><br>
And, stooping, made my cheek lie <mark3>there,</mark3><br>
And spread, o'er all, her yellow <mark3>hair,</mark3><br>
Murmuring how she loved me -- <mark3>she</mark3><br>
Too weak, for all her heart's <mark3>endeavour,</mark3><br>
To set its struggling passion <mark3>free</mark3><br>
From pride, and vainer ties <mark5>dissever,</mark5><br>
And give herself to me for <mark3>ever.</mark3><br>
But passion sometimes would <mark4>prevail,</mark4><br>
Nor could to-night's gay feast <mark3>restrain</mark3><br>
A sudden thought of one so <mark3>pale</mark3><br>
For love of her, and all in <mark3>vain:</mark3><br>
So, she was come through wind and <mark3>rain.</mark3><br>
Be sure I looked up at her <mark3>eyes</mark3><br>
Happy and proud; at last I <mark3>knew</mark3><br>
Porphyria worshipped me; <mark3>surprise</mark3><br>
Made my heart swell, and still it <mark3>grew</mark3><br>
While I debated what to <mark3>do.</mark3><br>
That moment she was mine, mine, <mark3>fair,</mark3><br>
Perfectly pure and good: I <mark4>found</mark4><br>
A thing to do, and all her <mark1>hair</mark1><br>
In one long yellow string I <mark3>wound</mark3><br>
Three times her little throat <mark3>around,</mark3><br>
And strangled her. No pain felt <mark1>she;</mark1><br>
I am quite sure she felt no <mark4>pain.</mark4><br>
As a shut bud that holds a <mark3>bee,</mark3><br>
I warily oped her lids: <mark3>again</mark3><br>
Laughed the blue eyes without a <mark3>stain.</mark3><br>
And I untightened next the <mark4>tress</mark4><br>
About her neck; her cheek once <mark4>more</mark4><br>
Blushed bright beneath my burning <mark4>kiss:</mark4><br>
I propped her head up as <mark3>before,</mark3><br>
Only, this time my shoulder <mark3>bore</mark3><br>
Her head, which droops upon it <mark4>still:</mark4><br>
The smiling rosy little <mark4>head,</mark4><br>
So glad it has its utmost <mark3>will,</mark3><br>
That all it scorned at once is <mark3>fled,</mark3><br>
And I, its love, am gained <mark3>instead!</mark3><br>
Porphyria's love: she guessed not <mark3>how</mark3><br>
Her darling one wish would be <mark4>heard.</mark4><br>
And thus we sit together <mark3>now,</mark3><br>
And all night long we have not <mark3>stirred,</mark3><br>
And yet God has not said a <mark3>word!</mark3><br>
