Title : The Agamemnon Rag <br>
Author : Jack Conway <br><br>

Atlas, you're Homer. I am so glad you're <mark4>Hera.</mark4><br>
Thera so many things to tell you. I went on <mark4>that</mark4><br>
minotaur of the museum. The new display <mark4>centaurs</mark4><br>
on how you can contract Sisyphus if you don't <mark4>use</mark4><br>
a Trojan on your Dictys. It was all Greek to <mark3>me</mark3>, <mark3>see.</mark3><br>
When I was Roman <mark4>around,</mark4><br>
I rubbed Midas against someone. "Medea, you look like a <mark4>Goddess,"</mark4><br>
he said. The Minerva him! I told him <mark4>to</mark4><br>
Frigg off, oracle the cops. "Loki here," I <mark1>said.</mark1><br>
"In Odin times men had better manners." It's best to try    <br>
and nymph that sort of thing in the bud. He said he <mark3>knew</mark3><br>
Athena two about women like me, then tried to <mark4>Bacchus</mark4><br>
into a corner. Dryads I could, he wouldn't stop.    <br>
"Don't Troy with my affections," he <mark1>said.</mark1><br>
"I'm already going to Helen a hand <mark4>basket."</mark4><br>
I pretended to be completely Apollo by his <mark4>behavior.</mark4><br>
If something like that Mars your day, it Styx with <mark3>you</mark3><br>
forever. "I'm not Bragi," he said. "But Idon <mark4>better."</mark4><br>
Some people will never Lerna. Juno what I <mark4>did?</mark4><br>
Valhalla for help. I knew the police <mark4>would</mark4><br>
Pegasus to the wall. The Sirens went <mark4>off.</mark4><br>
Are you or Argonaut guilty, they <mark4>asked.</mark4><br>
He told the cops he was Iliad bad <mark4>clams.</mark4><br>
He said he accidentally Electra Cupid <mark4>himself</mark4><br>
trying to adjust a lamp shade. This job has <mark4>its</mark4><br>
pluses and Minos. The cops figured he was Fulla <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
He nearly Runic for me. I'm telling <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
it was quite an Odyssey, but I knew things <mark1>would</mark1><br>
Pan out. And oh, by the way, here's all his <mark4>gold.</mark4><br>
I was able to Fleece him before the museum <mark4>closed.</mark4><br>
