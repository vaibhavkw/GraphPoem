Title : Immortal Autumn <br>
Author : Archibald MacLeish <br><br>

I speak this poem now with grave and level voice   <br>
In praise of autumn, of the far-horn-winding <mark3>fall.</mark3><br>
<br>
I praise the flower-barren fields, the clouds, the <mark3>tall</mark3><br>
Unanswering branches where the wind makes sullen <mark4>noise.</mark4><br>
<br>
I praise the fall: it is the human <mark4>season.</mark4><br>
<br>
No more the foreign sun does meddle at our <mark3>earth,</mark3><br>
Enforce the green and bring the fallow land to <mark3>birth,</mark3><br>
Nor winter yet weigh all with silence the pine bough, <br>
<br>
But now in autumn with the black and outcast <mark4>crows</mark4><br>
Share we the spacious world: the whispering year is <mark4>gone:</mark4><br>
There is more room to live now: the once secret <mark3>dawn</mark3><br>
Comes late by daylight and the dark unguarded <mark3>goes.</mark3><br>
<br>
Between the mutinous brave burning of the <mark4>leaves</mark4><br>
And winter's covering of our hearts with his deep <mark3>snow</mark3><br>
We are alone: there are no evening birds: we <mark3>know</mark3><br>
The naked moon: the tame stars circle at our <mark3>eaves.</mark3><br>
<br>
It is the human season. On this sterile <mark1>air</mark1><br>
Do words outcarry breath: the sound goes on and <mark3>on.</mark3><br>
I hear a dead man's cry from autumn long since <mark1>gone.</mark1><br>
<br>
I cry to you beyond upon this bitter <mark1>air.</mark1><br>
