Title : from Queen Mab: Part VI <br>
Author : Percy Bysshe Shelley <br><br>

<br>
"Throughout these infinite orbs of mingling <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
Of which yon earth is one, is wide diffus'd <br>
A Spirit of activity and <mark1>life,</mark1><br>
That knows no term, cessation, or decay; <br>
That fades not when the lamp of earthly <mark1>life,</mark1><br>
Extinguish'd in the dampness of the <mark5>grave,</mark5><br>
Awhile there slumbers, more than when the babe <br>
In the dim newness of its being <mark4>feels</mark4><br>
The impulses of sublunary <mark4>things,</mark4><br>
And all is wonder to unpractis'd <mark4>sense:</mark4><br>
But, active, steadfast and <mark4>eternal</mark4>, <mark4>still</mark4><br>
Guides the fierce whirlwind, in the tempest <mark4>roars,</mark4><br>
Cheers in the day, breathes in the balmy <mark4>groves,</mark4><br>
Strengthens in health, and poisons in <mark4>disease;</mark4><br>
And in the storm of change, that <mark4>ceaselessly</mark4><br>
Rolls round the eternal universe and <mark4>shakes</mark4><br>
Its undecaying battlement, <mark4>presides,</mark4><br>
Apportioning with irresistible law <br>
The place each spring of its machine shall <mark3>fill;</mark3><br>
So that when waves on waves tumultuous <mark4>heap</mark4><br>
Confusion to the clouds, and fiercely <mark4>driven</mark4><br>
Heaven's lightnings scorch the uprooted <mark4>ocean-fords,</mark4><br>
Whilst, to the eye of shipwreck'd <mark4>mariner,</mark4><br>
Lone sitting on the bare and shuddering <mark4>rock,</mark4><br>
All seems unlink'd contingency and <mark4>chance,</mark4><br>
No atom of this turbulence fulfils <br>
A vague and unnecessitated <mark4>task,</mark4><br>
Or acts but as it must and ought to <mark4>act.</mark4><br>
Even the minutest molecule of <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
That in an April sunbeam's fleeting <mark3>glow</mark3><br>
Fulfils its destin'd, though invisible <mark4>work,</mark4><br>
The universal Spirit guides; nor <mark4>less,</mark4><br>
When merciless ambition, or mad <mark4>zeal,</mark4><br>
Has led two hosts of dupes to <mark4>battlefield,</mark4><br>
That, blind, they there may dig each other's <mark4>graves,</mark4><br>
And call the sad work glory, does it <mark4>rule</mark4><br>
All passions: not a thought, a will, an <mark1>act,</mark1><br>
No working of the tyrant's moody <mark4>mind,</mark4><br>
Nor one misgiving of the slaves who <mark4>boast</mark4><br>
Their servitude to hide the shame they <mark4>feel,</mark4><br>
Nor the events enchaining every <mark4>will,</mark4><br>
That from the depths of unrecorded <mark4>time</mark4><br>
Have drawn all-influencing virtue, <mark4>pass</mark4><br>
Unrecogniz'd or unforeseen by <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
Soul of the Universe! eternal <mark4>spring</mark4><br>
Of life and death, of happiness and <mark3>woe,</mark3><br>
Of all that chequers the phantasmal <mark4>scene</mark4><br>
That floats before our eyes in wavering <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
Which gleams but on the darkness of our <mark4>prison,</mark4><br>
Whose chains and massy <mark4>walls</mark4><br>
We feel, but cannot <mark3>see.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Spirit of Nature! all-sufficing <mark4>Power,</mark4><br>
Necessity! thou mother of the <mark4>world!</mark4><br>
Unlike the God of human error, <mark1>thou</mark1><br>
Requir'st no prayers or praises; the <mark4>caprice</mark4><br>
Of man's weak will belongs no more to <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
Than do the changeful passions of his <mark4>breast</mark4><br>
To thy unvarying harmony: the <mark3>slave,</mark3><br>
Whose horrible lusts spread misery o'er the <mark1>world,</mark1><br>
And the good man, who lifts with virtuous <mark4>pride</mark4><br>
His being in the sight of <mark4>happiness</mark4><br>
That springs from his own works; the <mark3>poison-tree,</mark3><br>
Beneath whose shade all life is wither'd <mark4>up,</mark4><br>
And the fair oak, whose leafy dome <mark4>affords</mark4><br>
A temple where the vows of happy <mark4>love</mark4><br>
Are register'd, are equal in thy <mark4>sight:</mark4><br>
No love, no hate thou cherishest; revenge <br>
And favouritism, and worst desire of <mark4>fame</mark4><br>
Thou know'st not: all that the wide world <mark4>contains</mark4><br>
Are but thy passive instruments, and <mark1>thou</mark1><br>
Regard'st them all with an impartial eye, <br>
Whose joy or pain thy nature cannot <mark1>feel,</mark1><br>
Because thou hast not human <mark1>sense,</mark1><br>
Because thou art not human <mark1>mind.</mark1><br>
<br>
"Yes! when the sweeping storm of <mark1>time</mark1><br>
Has sung its death-dirge o'er the ruin'd <mark5>fanes</mark5><br>
And broken altars of the almighty <mark4>Fiend</mark4><br>
Whose name usurps thy honours, and the <mark4>blood</mark4><br>
Through centuries clotted there has floated <mark4>down</mark4><br>
The tainted flood of ages, shalt thou <mark4>live</mark4><br>
Unchangeable! A shrine is rais'd to <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
Which, nor the tempest-breath of <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
Nor the interminable <mark3>flood</mark3><br>
Over earth's slight pageant <mark4>rolling,</mark4><br>
                Availeth to destroy-- <br>
The sensitive extension of the <mark1>world.</mark1><br>
That wondrous and eternal <mark4>fane,</mark4><br>
Where pain and pleasure, good and evil <mark4>join,</mark4><br>
To do the will of strong <mark4>necessity,</mark4><br>
And life, in multitudinous <mark4>shapes,</mark4><br>
Still pressing forward where no term can <mark4>be,</mark4><br>
Like hungry and unresting <mark4>flame</mark4><br>
Curls round the eternal columns of its strength." <br>
