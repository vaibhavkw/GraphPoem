Title : Yesterday <br>
Author : Edgar Albert Guest <br><br>

I've trod the links with many a <mark3>man,</mark3><br>
And played him club for <mark3>club;</mark3><br>
'Tis scarce a year since I <mark3>began</mark3><br>
And I am still a <mark3>dub.</mark3><br>
But this I've noticed as we <mark3>strayed</mark3><br>
Along the bunkered <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
No one with me has ever <mark3>played</mark3><br>
    As he did yesterday. <br>
<br>
It makes no difference what the <mark3>drive,</mark3><br>
Together as we <mark3>walk,</mark3><br>
Till we up to the ball <mark3>arrive,</mark3><br>
I get the same old <mark3>talk:</mark3><br>
"To-day there's something wrong with <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
Just what I cannot <mark3>say.</mark3><br>
Would you believe I got a <mark3>three</mark3><br>
For this <mark5>hole--yesterday?"</mark5><br>
<br>
I see them top and slice a <mark3>shot,</mark3><br>
And fail to follow <mark5>through,</mark5><br>
And with their brassies plough the <mark3>lot,</mark3><br>
The very way I <mark3>do.</mark3><br>
To six and seven their figures <mark4>run,</mark4><br>
And then they sadly <mark1>say:</mark1><br>
"I neither dubbed nor foozled <mark3>one</mark3><br>
When I <mark5>played--yesterday!"</mark5><br>
<br>
I have no yesterdays to <mark4>count,</mark4><br>
No good work to <mark3>recall;</mark3><br>
Each morning sees hope proudly <mark3>mount,</mark3><br>
Each evening sees it <mark3>fall.</mark3><br>
And in the locker room at <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
When men discuss their <mark3>play,</mark3><br>
I hear them and I wish I <mark3>might</mark3><br>
    Have seen them--yesterday. <br>
<br>
Oh, dear old yesterday! What <mark3>store</mark3><br>
Of joys for men you <mark4>hold!</mark4><br>
I'm sure there is no day that's <mark3>more</mark3><br>
Remembered or <mark3>extolled.</mark3><br>
I'm off my task myself a <mark4>bit,</mark4><br>
My mind has run <mark3>astray;</mark3><br>
I think, perhaps, I should have <mark3>writ</mark3><br>
    These verses--yesterday.<br>
