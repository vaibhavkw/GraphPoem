Title : To John Clare <br>
Author : John Clare <br><br>

Well, honest John, how fare you now at <mark4>home?</mark4><br>
The spring is come, and birds are building nests; <br>
The old cock-robin to the sty is <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
With olive feathers and its ruddy <mark3>breast;</mark3><br>
And the old cock, with wattles and red <mark4>comb,</mark4><br>
Struts with the hens, and seems to like some <mark3>best,</mark3><br>
Then <mark4>crows</mark4>, and looks about for little <mark4>crumbs,</mark4><br>
Swept out by little folks an hour <mark3>ago;</mark3><br>
The pigs sleep in the sty; the bookman <mark3>comes--</mark3><br>
The little boy lets home-close nesting <mark3>go,</mark3><br>
And pockets tops and taws, where daisies <mark3>blow,</mark3><br>
To look at the new number just laid <mark3>down,</mark3><br>
With lots of pictures, and good stories too, <br>
And Jack the Giant-killer's high <mark3>renown.</mark3><br>
