Title : In the Marble Quarry <br>
Author : James L. Dickey <br><br>

Beginning to dangle <mark4>beneath</mark4><br>
The wind that blows from the undermined <mark4>wood,</mark4><br>
I feel the great pulley <mark4>grind,</mark4><br>
<br>
The thread I cling to <mark4>lengthen</mark4><br>
And let me soaring and spinning down into <mark4>marble,</mark4><br>
      Hooked and weightlessly happy <br>
<br>
Where the squared sun <mark4>shines</mark4><br>
Back equally from all four sides, out of <mark4>stone</mark4><br>
      And years of dazzling labor, <br>
<br>
To land at last among <mark4>men</mark4><br>
Who cut with power saws a Parian <mark4>whiteness</mark4><br>
      And, chewing slow tobacco, <br>
<br>
Their eyebrows like <mark4>frost,</mark4><br>
Shunt house-sized blocks and lash them to <mark4>cables</mark4><br>
      And send them heavenward <br>
<br>
Into small-town <mark4>banks,</mark4><br>
Into the columns and statues of government <mark4>buildings,</mark4><br>
But mostly <mark4>graves.</mark4><br>
<br>
I mount my monument and <mark4>rise</mark4><br>
Slowly and spinningly from the white-gloved <mark1>men</mark1><br>
Toward the hewn <mark3>sky</mark3><br>
<br>
Out of the basement of <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
Sadly, lifted through time's blinding <mark4>layers</mark4><br>
On perhaps my <mark4>tombstone</mark4><br>
<br>
      In which the original shape <br>
Michelangelo believed was in every rock upon <mark4>earth</mark4><br>
      Is heavily stirring, <br>
<br>
Surprised to be an <mark4>angel,</mark4><br>
To be waked in North Georgia by the ponderous play   <br>
Of men with ten-ton <mark4>blocks</mark4><br>
<br>
But no more surprised than <mark3>I</mark3><br>
To feel sadness fall off as though I myself   <br>
Were rising from <mark1>stone</mark1><br>
<br>
      Held by a thread in midair, <br>
Badly cut, local-looking, and totally <mark4>uninspired,</mark4><br>
      Not a masterwork <br>
<br>
Or even worth seeing at <mark4>all</mark4><br>
But the spirit of this place just the same,   <br>
      Felt here as joy.<br>
