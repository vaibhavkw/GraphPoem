Title : On Mr. G. Herbert's Book <br>
Author : Richard Crashaw <br><br>

Know you fair, on what you <mark3>look;</mark3><br>
Divinest love lies in this <mark3>book,</mark3><br>
Expecting fire from your <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
To kindle this his sacrifice. <br>
When your hands untie these <mark4>strings,</mark4><br>
Think you'have an angel by th' <mark3>wings.</mark3><br>
One that gladly will be <mark3>nigh,</mark3><br>
To wait upon each morning <mark3>sigh.</mark3><br>
To flutter in the balmy <mark3>air</mark3><br>
Of your well-perfumed <mark3>prayer.</mark3><br>
These white plumes of his he'll lend <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
Which every day to heaven will send <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
To take acquaintance of the <mark4>sphere,</mark4><br>
And all the smooth-fac'd kindred <mark4>there.</mark4><br>
And though Herbert's name do <mark3>owe</mark3><br>
These devotions, fairest, <mark3>know</mark3><br>
That while I lay them on the <mark3>shrine</mark3><br>
Of your white hand, they are <mark3>mine.</mark3><br>
