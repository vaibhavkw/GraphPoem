Author : Robert Browning <br><br>

[Florentine painter, 1412-69]<br>
I am poor brother Lippo, by your <mark4>leave!</mark4><br>
You need not clap your torches to my <mark4>face.</mark4><br>
Zooks,Zooks! word of emphasis, from "Gadzooks", as in "God's hooks" - referring to the nails that held Christ to the Cross what's to blame? you think you see a <mark4>monk!</mark4><br>
What, 'tis past midnight, and you go the <mark4>rounds,</mark4><br>
And here you catch me at an alley's <mark3>end</mark3><br>
Where sportivesportive amorous in nature, wanton ladies leave their doors <mark4>ajar?</mark4><br>
The Carmine'sCarmine's Convent of the Carmine, where Lippi was placed at the age of eight. my cloister: hunt it <mark4>up,</mark4><br>
Do,--harry outharry out drive off, if you must show your <mark4>zeal,</mark4><br>
Whatever rat, there, haps on his wrong <mark4>hole,</mark4><br>
And nip each softlingsoftling "a soft little hand" [OED] of a wee white <mark4>mouse,</mark4><br>
Weke, weke, that's crept to keep him <mark5>company!</mark5><br>
Aha, you know your betters! Then, you'll <mark4>take</mark4><br>
Your hand away that's fiddling on my <mark4>throat,</mark4><br>
And please to know me likewise. Who am <mark2>I?</mark2><br>
Why, one, sir, who is lodging with a <mark3>friend</mark3><br>
Three streets off--he's a certain . . . how d'ye <mark4>call?</mark4><br>
Master--a ...Cosimo of the MediciCosimo of the Medici 1389-1464, Florentine politician and patron of the arts, who supported Lippi <mark4>,</mark4><br>
I' the house that caps the corner. Boh! you were <mark4>best!</mark4><br>
Remember and tell me, the day you're <mark4>hanged,</mark4><br>
How you affected such a <mark4>gullet's-gripe!</mark4><br>
But you, sir, it concerns you that your <mark4>knaves</mark4><br>
Pick up a manner nor discredit <mark3>you:</mark3><br>
Zooks, are we pilchardspilchards small sea fish, that they sweep the <mark4>streets</mark4><br>
And count fair price what comes into their <mark4>net?</mark4><br>
He's Judas to a tittleto a tittle to a T, that man <mark4>is!</mark4><br>
Just such a face! Why, sir, you make <mark4>amends.</mark4><br>
Lord, I'm not angry! Bid your hang-dogshang-dogs despicable people <mark3>go</mark3><br>
Drink out this quarter-florin to the <mark5>health</mark5><br>
Of the munificent House that harbours <mark3>me</mark3><br>
(And many more <mark1>beside</mark1>, lads! more <mark4>beside!)</mark4><br>
And all's come square again. I'd like his <mark1>face--</mark1><br>
His, elbowing on his comrade in the <mark4>door</mark4><br>
With the pike and lantern,--for the slave that <mark4>holds</mark4><br>
John Baptist's head a-dangle by the <mark4>hair</mark4><br>
With one hand ("Look you, now," as who should <mark3>say)</mark3><br>
And his weapon in the other, yet unwiped!John Baptist's head a-dangle ... unwiped John the Baptist was a New Testament prophet who baptized Jesus; see Matthew 3. The "Beheading of the Baptist" and "Banquet of Herod" are two works by Lippi (both in Prato) on the theme of John the Baptist's end at Herod's <mark4>hands.</mark4><br>
It's not your chance to have a bit of <mark4>chalk,</mark4><br>
A wood-coal or the like? or you should <mark3>see!</mark3><br>
Yes, I'm the painter, since you style me <mark3>so.</mark3><br>
What, brother Lippo's doings, up and <mark4>down,</mark4><br>
You know them and they take you? like <mark4>enough!</mark4><br>
I saw the proper twinkle in your <mark2>eye--</mark2><br>
'Tell you, I liked your looks at very <mark4>first.</mark4><br>
Let's sit and set things straight now, hip to haunch. <br>
Here's spring come, and the nights one makes up <mark3>bands</mark3><br>
To roam the town and sing out carnivalcarnival riotous season prior to the austerity of <mark4>Lent,</mark4><br>
And I've been three weeks shut within my mewmew figuratively speaking, a <mark4>cage,</mark4><br>
A-painting for the great man, saints and <mark4>saints</mark4><br>
And saints again. I could not paint all <mark4>night--</mark4><br>
Ouf! I leaned out of window for fresh <mark3>air.</mark3><br>
There came a hurry of feet and little <mark4>feet,</mark4><br>
A sweep of lute strings, laughs, and whiftswhifts bits of a song of song, <mark4>--</mark4><br>
Flower o' the <mark3>broom,</mark3><br>
Take away love, and our earth is a <mark3>tomb!</mark3><br>
Flower o' the <mark4>quince,</mark4><br>
I let Lisa go, and what good in life <mark3>since?</mark3><br>
Flower o' the thyme--and so on. Round they <mark4>went.</mark4><br>
Scarce had they turned the corner when a <mark4>titter</mark4><br>
Like the skipping of rabbits by moonlight,--three slim <mark4>shapes,</mark4><br>
And a face that looked up . . . zooks, sir, flesh and <mark4>blood,</mark4><br>
That's all I'm made of! Into shreds it <mark1>went,</mark1><br>
Curtain and counterpane and coverlet, <br>
All the bed-furniture--a dozen <mark4>knots,</mark4><br>
There was a ladder! Down I let <mark4>myself,</mark4><br>
Hands and feet, scrambling somehow, and so <mark4>dropped,</mark4><br>
And after them. I came up with the <mark4>fun</mark4><br>
Hard by Saint LaurenceSaint Laurence a church in Florence: S. Lorenzo in Vasari. Lippi painted an Annunciation scene here, hail fellow, well <mark4>met,--</mark4><br>
Flower o' the <mark4>rose,</mark4><br>
If I've been merry, what matter who <mark3>knows?</mark3><br>
And so as I was stealing back <mark4>again</mark4><br>
To get to bed and have a bit of <mark4>sleep</mark4><br>
Ere I rise up to-morrow and go <mark4>work</mark4><br>
On Jerome knocking at his poor old <mark4>breast</mark4><br>
With his great round stone to subdue the flesh,Jerome ...flesh St. Jerome (c.340-420), a Doctor of the Latin Church, noted for an ascetic life and <mark4>writings</mark4><br>
You snap me of the sudden. Ah, I <mark1>see!</mark1><br>
Though your eye twinkles still, you shake your <mark4>head--</mark4><br>
Mine's shaved--a monk, you say--the sting 's in <mark4>that!</mark4><br>
If Master Cosimo announced <mark3>himself,</mark3><br>
Mum's the word naturally; but a <mark1>monk!</mark1><br>
Come, what am I a beast for? tell us, <mark1>now!</mark1><br>
I was a baby when my mother <mark4>died</mark4><br>
And father died and left me in the <mark4>street.</mark4><br>
I starved there, God knows how, a year or <mark3>two</mark3><br>
On fig-skins, melon-parings, rinds and <mark4>shucks,</mark4><br>
Refuse and rubbish. One fine frosty <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
My stomach being empty as your <mark4>hat,</mark4><br>
The wind doubled me up and down I <mark1>went.</mark1><br>
Old Aunt LapacciaAunt Lapaccia Filippo's aunt, who cared for him after his father died trussed me with one <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
(Its fellow was a stinger as I <mark3>knew)</mark3><br>
And so along the wall, over the <mark4>bridge,</mark4><br>
By the straight cut to the convent. Six words <mark3>there,</mark3><br>
While I stood munching my first bread that <mark4>month:</mark4><br>
"So, boy, you're minded," quoth the good fat <mark4>father</mark4><br>
Wiping his own mouth, 'twas <mark4>refection-time,--</mark4><br>
"To quit this very miserable <mark4>world?</mark4><br>
Will you renounce" . . . "the mouthful of bread?" thought <mark1>I;</mark1><br>
By no means! Brief, they made a monk of <mark1>me;</mark1><br>
I did renounce the <mark4>world</mark4>, its pride and <mark4>greed,</mark4><br>
Palace, farm, villa, shop, and <mark4>banking-house,</mark4><br>
Trash, such as these poor devils of <mark4>Medici</mark4><br>
Have given their hearts to--all at eight years <mark4>old.</mark4><br>
Well, sir, I found in time, you may be <mark4>sure,</mark4><br>
'Twas not for nothing--the good <mark5>bellyful,</mark5><br>
The warm serge and the rope that goes all <mark4>round,</mark4><br>
And day-long blessed idleness <mark1>beside!</mark1><br>
"Let's see what the urchin's fit for"--that came <mark4>next.</mark4><br>
Not overmuch their way, I must <mark4>confess.</mark4><br>
Such a to-do! They tried me with their <mark4>books:</mark4><br>
Lord, they'd have taught me Latin in pure <mark4>waste!</mark4><br>
Flower o' the <mark5>clove.</mark5><br>
All the Latin I construe is, "amo" I <mark4>love!</mark4><br>
But, mind you, when a boy starves in the <mark1>streets</mark1><br>
Eight years together, as my fortune <mark4>was,</mark4><br>
Watching folk's faces to know who will <mark4>fling</mark4><br>
The bit of half-stripped grape-bunch he <mark4>desires,</mark4><br>
And who will curse or kick him for his <mark4>pains,--</mark4><br>
Which gentleman processional and <mark4>fine,</mark4><br>
Holding a candle to the <mark4>Sacrament,</mark4><br>
Will wink and let him lift a plate and <mark4>catch</mark4><br>
The droppings of the wax to sell <mark1>again,</mark1><br>
Or holla for the Eightthe Eight "the magistrates of Florence" [Ian Jack]  and have him <mark4>whipped,--</mark4><br>
How say I?--nay, which dog bites, which lets <mark4>drop</mark4><br>
His bone from the heap of offal in the <mark1>street,--</mark1><br>
Why, soul and sense of him grow sharp <mark4>alike,</mark4><br>
He learns the look of things, and none the <mark4>less</mark4><br>
For admonition from the <mark4>hunger-pinch.</mark4><br>
I had a store of such remarks, be <mark1>sure,</mark1><br>
Which, after I found leisure, turned to <mark4>use.</mark4><br>
I drew men's faces on my <mark4>copy-books,</mark4><br>
Scrawled them within the antiphonary's margeantiphonary's marge margin of an antiphon (a book of chants used during <mark4>Mass),</mark4><br>
Joined legs and arms to the long <mark4>music-notes,</mark4><br>
Found eyes and nose and chin for A's and <mark4>B's,</mark4><br>
And made a string of pictures of the <mark1>world</mark1><br>
Betwixt the ins and outs of verb and <mark4>noun,</mark4><br>
On the wall, the bench, the door. The monks looked <mark4>black.</mark4><br>
"Nay," quoth the Prior, "turn him out, d'ye <mark1>say?</mark1><br>
In no wise. Lose a crow and catch a <mark4>lark.</mark4><br>
What if at last we get our man of <mark4>parts,</mark4><br>
We CarmelitesCarmelites an order of mendicant friars, founded at Mount Carmel in the 12th Century; also called White Friars, like those CamaldoleseCamaldolese member of the religious order founded in the 11th Century also called Camaldolites <br>
And Preaching FriarsPreaching Friars Dominicans, an order of mendicant friars, founded by St. Dominic in the 13th Century, to do our church up <mark1>fine</mark1><br>
And put the front on it that ought to <mark4>be!"</mark4><br>
And hereupon he bade me daub <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
Thank you! my head being crammed, the walls a <mark4>blank,</mark4><br>
Never was such prompt disemburdeningdisemburdening disburdening. <br>
First, every sort of monk, the black and whitethe black and the white Black Friars are Dominicans; White Friars are Carmelites, <br>
I drew them, fat and lean: then, folk at <mark4>church,</mark4><br>
From good old gossips waiting to <mark1>confess</mark1><br>
Their cribscribs minor thefts of <mark4>barrel-droppings</mark4>, <mark4>candle-ends,--</mark4><br>
To the breathless fellow at the <mark4>altar-foot,</mark4><br>
Fresh from his murder, safe and sitting <mark1>there</mark1><br>
With the little children round him in a <mark3>row</mark3><br>
Of admiration, half for his beard and <mark4>half</mark4><br>
For that white anger of his victim's <mark4>son</mark4><br>
Shaking a fist at him with one fierce <mark4>arm,</mark4><br>
Signing himself with the other because of <mark4>Christ</mark4><br>
(Whose sad face on the cross sees only <mark4>this</mark4><br>
After the passion of a thousand <mark4>years)</mark4><br>
Till some poor girl, her apron o'er her <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
(Which the intense eyes looked through) came at <mark4>eve</mark4><br>
On tiptoe, said a word, dropped in a <mark4>loaf,</mark4><br>
Her pair of earrings and a bunch of <mark4>flowers</mark4><br>
(The brute took growling), prayed, and so was <mark4>gone.</mark4><br>
I painted all, then cried "'Tis ask and <mark4>have;</mark4><br>
Choose, for more's ready!"--laid the ladder <mark4>flat,</mark4><br>
And showed my covered bit of <mark3>cloister-wall.</mark3><br>
The monks closed in a circle and praised <mark4>loud</mark4><br>
Till checked, taught what to see and not to <mark1>see,</mark1><br>
Being simple bodies,--"That's the very <mark4>man!</mark4><br>
Look at the boy who stoops to pat the dog! <br>
That woman's like the Prior's niecePrior's niece euphemism for an intimate of the Prior who <mark4>comes</mark4><br>
To care about his asthma: it's the <mark4>life!''</mark4><br>
But there my triumph's straw-fire flared and funkedfunked went <mark4>out</mark4>, <mark4>smoked;</mark4><br>
Their betters took their turn to see and <mark1>say:</mark1><br>
The Prior and the learned pulled a <mark1>face</mark1><br>
And stopped all that in no time. "How? what's <mark4>here?</mark4><br>
Quite from the mark of painting, bless us <mark3>all!</mark3><br>
Faces, arms, legs, and bodies like the <mark3>true</mark3><br>
As much as pea and pea! it's <mark4>devil's-game!</mark4><br>
Your business is not to catch men with <mark3>show,</mark3><br>
With homage to the perishable <mark3>clay,</mark3><br>
But lift them over it, ignore it <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
Make them forget there's such a thing as <mark4>flesh.</mark4><br>
Your business is to paint the souls of <mark4>men--</mark4><br>
Man's soul, and it's a fire, smoke . . . no, it's not . . <mark4>.</mark4><br>
It's vapour done up like a new-born <mark1>babe--</mark1><br>
(In that shape when you die it leaves your <mark4>mouth)</mark4><br>
It's . . . well, what matters talking, it's the <mark4>soul!</mark4><br>
Give us no more of body than shows <mark1>soul!</mark1><br>
Here's GiottoGiotto Florentine painter, Giotto di Bondone (1266/67-1337) [Metropolitan Museum site] (For an example of his work, see here.), with his Saint a-praising <mark4>God,</mark4><br>
That sets us praising--why not stop with <mark4>him?</mark4><br>
Why put all thoughts of praise out of our <mark1>head</mark1><br>
With wonder at lines, colours, and what <mark1>not?</mark1><br>
Paint the soul, never mind the legs and <mark4>arms!</mark4><br>
Rub all out, try at it a second <mark4>time.</mark4><br>
Oh, that white smallish female with the <mark4>breasts,</mark4><br>
She's just my niece . . . HerodiasHerodias Herod's second wife, see Matthew 14:1-12. Her daughter Salome dances before Herod, who afterwards grants her whatever she will wish.   At the suggestion of Herodias, Salome asks for John the Baptist's head.   Lippi's "Banquet of Herod" (in Prato) shows this scene of the Baptist's head on a platter., I would <mark1>say,--</mark1><br>
Who went and danced and got men's heads cut <mark4>off!</mark4><br>
Have it all out!" Now, is this sense, I <mark4>ask?</mark4><br>
A fine way to paint soul, by painting <mark4>body</mark4><br>
So ill, the eye can't stop there, must go <mark4>further</mark4><br>
And can't fare worse! Thus, yellow does for <mark4>white</mark4><br>
When what you put for yellow's simply <mark1>black,</mark1><br>
And any sort of meaning looks <mark4>intense</mark4><br>
When all beside itself means and looks <mark5>nought.</mark5><br>
Why can't a painter lift each foot in <mark4>turn,</mark4><br>
Left foot and right foot, go a double <mark4>step,</mark4><br>
Make his flesh liker and his soul more <mark4>like,</mark4><br>
Both in their order? Take the prettiest <mark1>face,</mark1><br>
The Prior's niece . . . patron-saint--is it so <mark4>pretty</mark4><br>
You can't discover if it means hope, <mark4>fear,</mark4><br>
Sorrow or joy? won't beauty go with <mark4>these?</mark4><br>
Suppose I've made her eyes all right and <mark3>blue,</mark3><br>
Can't I take breath and try to add life's <mark4>flash,</mark4><br>
And then add soul and heighten them <mark4>three-fold?</mark4><br>
Or say there's beauty with no soul at <mark1>all--</mark1><br>
(I never saw it--put the case the <mark4>same--)</mark4><br>
If you get simple beauty and nought <mark4>else,</mark4><br>
You get about the best thing God <mark4>invents:</mark4><br>
That's somewhat: and you'll find the soul you have <mark4>missed,</mark4><br>
Within yourself, when you return him <mark4>thanks.</mark4><br>
"Rub all out!" Well, well, there's my life, in <mark4>short,</mark4><br>
And so the thing has gone on ever <mark1>since.</mark1><br>
I'm grown a man no doubt, I've broken <mark4>bounds:</mark4><br>
You should not take a fellow eight years <mark1>old</mark1><br>
And make him swear to never kiss the <mark4>girls.</mark4><br>
I'm my own master, paint now as I <mark4>please--</mark4><br>
Having a friend, you see, in the <mark4>Corner-house!</mark4><br>
Lord, it's fast holding by the rings in <mark4>front--</mark4><br>
Those great rings serve more purposes than <mark4>just</mark4><br>
To plant a flag in, or tie up a <mark4>horse!</mark4><br>
And yet the old schooling sticks, the old grave <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
Are peeping o'er my shoulder as I <mark1>work,</mark1><br>
The heads shake still--"It's art's <mark4>decline</mark4>, my <mark1>son!</mark1><br>
You're not of the true painters, great and <mark1>old;</mark1><br>

Flower o' the <mark4>pine,</mark4><br>
You keep your mistr ... manners, and I'll stick to <mark3>mine!</mark3><br>
I'm not the third, then: bless us, they must <mark3>know!</mark3><br>
Don't you think they're the likeliest to <mark1>know,</mark1><br>
They with their Latin? So, I swallow my <mark4>rage,</mark4><br>
Clench my teeth, suck my lips in <mark4>tight</mark4>, and <mark4>paint</mark4><br>
To please them--sometimes do and sometimes <mark4>don't;</mark4><br>
For, doing most, there's pretty sure to <mark4>come</mark4><br>
A turn, some warm eve finds me at my <mark1>saints--</mark1><br>
A laugh, a cry, the business of the <mark1>world--</mark1><br>

Death for us all, and his own life for <mark3>each!)</mark3><br>
And my whole soul revolves, the cup runs overcup runs over Compare to Psalms 23:5 : "my cup runneth <mark4>over.",</mark4><br>
The world and life's too big to pass for a <mark4>dream,</mark4><br>
And I do these wild things in sheer <mark4>despite,</mark4><br>
And play the fooleries you catch me <mark4>at,</mark4><br>
In pure rage! The old <mark4>mill-horse</mark4>, out at <mark4>grass</mark4><br>
After hard years, throws up his stiff heels <mark1>so,</mark1><br>
Although the miller does not preach to <mark1>him</mark1><br>
The only good of grass is to make <mark4>chaff.</mark4><br>
What would men have? Do they like grass or <mark3>no--</mark3><br>
May they or mayn't they? all I want's the <mark3>thing</mark3><br>
Settled for ever one way. As it <mark1>is,</mark1><br>
You tell too many lies and hurt <mark4>yourself:</mark4><br>
You don't like what you only like too <mark4>much,</mark4><br>
You do like what, if given you at your <mark4>word,</mark4><br>
You find abundantly detestable. <br>
For me, I think I speak as I was <mark4>taught;</mark4><br>
I always see the garden and God <mark1>there</mark1><br>
A-making man's wifeI always see the garden and God there ... wife See Genesis 2:18-23.: <mark4>and</mark4>, my lesson <mark4>learned,</mark4><br>
The value and significance of <mark1>flesh,</mark1><br>
I can't unlearn ten minutes <mark4>afterwards.</mark4><br>
<br>
You understand me: I'm a beast, I <mark1>know.</mark1><br>
But see, now--why, I see as <mark4>certainly</mark4><br>
As that the morning-star's about to <mark4>shine,</mark4><br>
What will hap some day. We've a youngster <mark1>here</mark1><br>
Comes to our convent, studies what I <mark3>do,</mark3><br>
Slouches and stares and lets no atom <mark1>drop:</mark1><br>
His name is Guidi--he'll not mind the <mark4>monks--</mark4><br>
They call him Hulking TomGuidi; Hulking Tom Tommaso Guidi, painter better known as Masaccio (1401-28), that is "Careless Tom, or Hulking Tom (not necessarily in disapproval)" (Vasari, 1.318)., he lets them <mark4>talk--</mark4><br>
He picks my practice up--he'll paint <mark4>apace.</mark4><br>
I hope so--though I never live so <mark4>long,</mark4><br>
I know what's sure to follow. You be <mark4>judge!</mark4><br>
You speak no Latin more than I, <mark5>belike;</mark5><br>
However, you're my man, you've seen the <mark1>world</mark1><br>
--The beauty and the wonder and the <mark4>power,</mark4><br>
The shapes of things, their colours, lights and <mark4>shades,</mark4><br>
Changes, surprises,--and God made it <mark1>all!</mark1><br>
--For what? Do you feel thankful, ay or <mark1>no,</mark1><br>
For this fair town's face, yonder river's <mark3>line,</mark3><br>
The mountain round it and the sky <mark4>above,</mark4><br>
Much more the figures of man, woman, <mark4>child,</mark4><br>
These are the frame to? What's it all <mark4>about?</mark4><br>
To be passed over, despised? or dwelt <mark4>upon,</mark4><br>
Wondered at? oh, this last of course!--you <mark1>say.</mark1><br>
But why not do as well as say,--paint <mark1>these</mark1><br>
Just as they are, careless what comes of <mark4>it?</mark4><br>
God's works--paint any one, and count it <mark4>crime</mark4><br>
To let a truth slip. Don't object, "His <mark4>works</mark4><br>
Are here already; nature is <mark4>complete:</mark4><br>
Suppose you reproduce her--(which you <mark4>can't)</mark4><br>
There's no advantage! you must beat her, <mark4>then."</mark4><br>
For, don't you mark? we're made so that we <mark1>love</mark1><br>
First when we see them painted, things we have <mark4>passed</mark4><br>
Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to <mark1>see;</mark1><br>
And so they are better, painted--better to <mark4>us,</mark4><br>
Which is the same thing. Art was given for <mark1>that;</mark1><br>
God uses us to help each other <mark1>so,</mark1><br>
Lending our minds out. Have you noticed, <mark1>now,</mark1><br>
Your cullion'scullion term of contempt: a rascal hanging face? A bit of <mark1>chalk,</mark1><br>
And trust me but you should, though! How much <mark4>more,</mark4><br>
If I drew higher things with the same <mark4>truth!</mark4><br>
That were to take the Prior's <mark4>pulpit-place,</mark4><br>
Interpret God to all of you! <mark1>Oh</mark1>, <mark3>oh,</mark3><br>
It makes me mad to see what men shall <mark1>do</mark1><br>
And we in our graves! This world's no blot for <mark1>us,</mark1><br>
Nor blank; it means intensely, and means <mark4>good:</mark4><br>
To find its meaning is my meat and <mark4>drink.</mark4><br>
"Ay, but you don't so instigate to <mark4>prayer!"</mark4><br>
Strikes in the Prior: "when your meaning's <mark4>plain</mark4><br>
It does not say to folk--remember matinsmatins a set time for morning <mark4>prayers,</mark4><br>
Or, mind you fast next Friday!" Why, for <mark1>this</mark1><br>
What need of art at all? A skull and <mark4>bones,</mark4><br>
Two bits of stick nailed crosswise, or, what's <mark1>best,</mark1><br>
A bell to chime the hour with, does as <mark4>well.</mark4><br>
I painted a Saint Laurence six months <mark1>since</mark1><br>
At PratoPrato the cathedral in Florence; Lippo made frescoes there from 1452-66, splashed the fresco in fine <mark4>style:</mark4><br>
"How looks my painting, now the scaffold's <mark1>down?"</mark1><br>
I ask a brother: "Hugely," he <mark4>returns--</mark4><br>
"Already not one phizphiz face, physiognomy of your three <mark4>slaves</mark4><br>
Who turn the Deacon off his toasted sideDeacon . . . toasted side St. Laurence (d. 258), who was a deacon and martyr; he was roasted to <mark4>death,</mark4><br>
But's scratched and prodded to our heart's <mark4>content,</mark4><br>
The pious people have so eased their <mark4>own</mark4><br>
With coming to say prayers there in a <mark1>rage:</mark1><br>
We get on fast to see the bricks <mark4>beneath.</mark4><br>
Expect another job this time next <mark4>year,</mark4><br>
For pity and religion grow i' the <mark4>crowd--</mark4><br>
Your painting serves its purpose!" Hang the <mark4>fools!</mark4><br>
<br>
--That is--you'll not mistake an idle <mark1>word</mark1><br>
Spoke in a huff by a poor monk, God wotGod wot God <mark1>knows,</mark1><br>
Tasting the air this spicy night which <mark4>turns</mark4><br>
The unaccustomed head like Chianti <mark4>wine!</mark4><br>
Oh, the church knows! don't misreport me, <mark1>now!</mark1><br>
It's natural a poor monk out of <mark1>bounds</mark1><br>
Should have his apt word to excuse <mark1>himself:</mark1><br>
And hearken how I plot to make <mark1>amends.</mark1><br>
I have bethought me: I shall paint a <mark4>piece</mark4><br>
... There's for you! Give me six months, then go, <mark1>see</mark1><br>
Something in Sant' Ambrogio'sSant' Ambrogio's Vasari: "There [Florence] he wrought a very beautiful panel for the high-altar of the Nuns of S. Ambrogio, which made him very dear to Cosimo de' Medici, who became very much his friend for this reason." [Giorgio Vasari Lives of the Painters, Sculptors and Architects, trans. Gaston du C. de Vere, New York: Alfred A. Knopf (Everyman's Library), 1:437]! Bless the <mark4>nuns!</mark4><br>
They want a cast o' my office. I shall <mark1>paint</mark1><br>
God in the midst, Madonna and her <mark1>babe,</mark1><br>
Ringed by a bowery, flowery <mark4>angel-brood,</mark4><br>
Lilies and vestments and white faces, <mark4>sweet</mark4><br>
As puff on puff of grated orris-rootorris-root an iris, used in powdered form in perfumes and <mark4>medicine</mark4><br>
When ladies crowd to Church at <mark4>midsummer.</mark4><br>
And then i' the front, of course a saint or <mark1>two--</mark1><br>
Saint John' because he saves the FlorentinesSaint John ... Florentines John the Baptist, who baptized Jesus; see Matthew 3. Also see earlier <mark4>note.,</mark4><br>
Saint Ambrose, who puts down in black and <mark1>white</mark1><br>
The convent's friends and gives them a long daySaint Ambrose ... day Either Saint Ambrose (c. 339-97) a Doctor of the Latin Church, who was the bishop of Milan, or Saint Ambrose of Camaldoli, also known as Fra Ambrogio (c. 1386-1439), who was in the Camaldolensian Order in <mark4>Florence.,</mark4><br>
And Job, I must have him there past <mark4>mistake,</mark4><br>
The man of UzJob; man of Uz Job   main character of The Book of Job in the Hebrew Bible, focusing on Job's suffering, and by extension, human suffering. Job 1.1 begins "There was once a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job." (and Us without the <mark3>z,</mark3><br>
Painters who need his patience). Well, all <mark1>these</mark1><br>
Secured at their devotion, up shall <mark1>come</mark1><br>
Out of a corner when you least <mark4>expect,</mark4><br>
As one by a dark stair into a great <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
Music and talking, who but Lippo! <mark1>I!--</mark1><br>
MazedMazed stupefied, motionless, and moonstruck--I'm the <mark1>man!</mark1><br>
Back I shrink--what is this I see and <mark4>hear?</mark4><br>
I, caught up with my monk's-things by <mark1>mistake,</mark1><br>
My old serge gown and rope that goes all <mark1>round,</mark1><br>
I, in this presence, this pure <mark1>company!</mark1><br>
Where's a hole, where's a corner for <mark4>escape?</mark4><br>
Then steps a sweet angelic slip of a <mark1>thing</mark1><br>
Forward, puts out a soft palm--"Not so <mark4>fast!"</mark4><br>
--Addresses the celestial presence, <mark3>"nay--</mark3><br>
He made you and devised you, after <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
Though he's none of you! Could Saint John there draw-- <br>
His camel-hair make up a painting <mark4>brush?</mark4><br>
We come to brother Lippo for all <mark1>that,</mark1><br>
Iste perfecit opus!Iste perfecit opus From the Latin, " 'This man made the work.' In this painting, as later completed, these words appear beside a figure which Browning took to be Lippi's self-portrait." [Norton The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Major Authors Edition. Ed. M. H. Abrams et al., 1962] So, all <mark4>smile--</mark4><br>
I shuffle sideways with my blushing <mark1>face</mark1><br>
Under the cover of a hundred <mark4>wings</mark4><br>
Thrown like a spread of kirtleskirtles a man's tunic or a woman's gown when you're <mark3>gay</mark3><br>
And play hot cocklesplay hot cockles a euphemism, based on the name of a children's game, for having sex, all the doors being <mark4>shut,</mark4><br>
Till, wholly unexpected, in there <mark4>pops</mark4><br>
The hothead husband! Thus I scuttle <mark1>off</mark1><br>
To some safe bench behind, not letting <mark1>go</mark1><br>
The palm of her, the little lily <mark1>thing</mark1><br>
That spoke the good word for me in the <mark4>nick,</mark4><br>
Like the Prior's niece . . . Saint LucySaint Lucy a virgin and martyr who died in Syracuse, Sicily, in the early 4th Century; she is a patron saint for those with eye diseases, I would <mark1>say.</mark1><br>
And so all's saved for me, and for the <mark1>church</mark1><br>
A pretty picture gained. Go, six months <mark4>hence!</mark4><br>
Your hand, sir, and good-bye: no <mark1>lights</mark1>, no <mark4>lights!</mark4><br>
The street's hushed, and I know my own way <mark4>back,</mark4><br>
Don't fear me! There's the grey beginning. Zooks! <br>
