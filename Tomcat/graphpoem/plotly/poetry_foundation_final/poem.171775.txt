Title : A Phonecall from Frank O'Hara <br>
Author : Anne Waldman <br><br>

"That all these dyings may be life in <mark4>death"</mark4><br>
I was living in San <mark5>Francisco</mark5><br>
My heart was in <mark4>Manhattan</mark4><br>
It made no sense, no reference <mark4>point</mark4><br>
Hearing the sad horns at <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
fragile evocations of female <mark4>stuff</mark4><br>
The 3 tones (the last most <mark4>resonant)</mark4><br>
were like warnings, haiku-muezzins at <mark4>dawn</mark4><br>
The call came in the <mark4>afternoon</mark4><br>
"Frank, is that really <mark3>you?"</mark3><br>
<br>
I'd awake chilled at <mark1>dawn</mark1><br>
in the wooden house like an old ship   <br>
Stay bundled through the <mark3>day</mark3><br>
sitting on the stoop to catch the <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
I lived near the park whose deep <mark4>green</mark4><br>
over my shoulder made life <mark4>cooler</mark4><br>
Was my spirit faltering, grown <mark4>duller?</mark4><br>
I want to be free of poetry's <mark4>ornaments,</mark4><br>
its duty, free of constant <mark4>irritation,</mark4><br>
me in it, what was grander <mark4>reason</mark4><br>
for being? Do it, why? (Why, <mark5>Frank?)</mark5><br>
To make the energies dance <mark4>etc.</mark4><br>
<br>
My coat a cape of <mark4>horrors</mark4><br>
I'd walk through town <mark3>or</mark3><br>
impending earthquake. Was that <mark4>it?</mark4><br>
Ominous days. Street shiny <mark4>with</mark4><br>
hallucinatory light on sad <mark4>dogs,</mark4><br>
too many religious people, or a <mark4>woman</mark4><br>
startled me by her look of <mark4>indecision</mark4><br>
near the empty <mark4>stadium</mark4><br>
I walked back spooked by <br>
my own <mark4>darkness</mark4><br>
Then Frank called to <mark3>say</mark3><br>
"What? Not done complaining <mark4>yet?</mark4><br>
Can't you smell the <mark4>eucalyptus,</mark4><br>
have you never neared the <mark4>Pacific?</mark4><br>
'While frank and free/call <mark3>for</mark3><br>
musick while your veins <mark4>swell'"</mark4><br>
he sang, quoting a metaphysician   <br>
"Don't you know the secret, how <mark4>to</mark4><br>
wake up and see you don't <mark4>exist</mark4>, <mark4>but</mark4><br>
that does, don't you see <mark4>phenomena</mark4><br>
is so much more important than <mark4>this?</mark4><br>
I always love <mark4>that."</mark4><br>
"Always?" I cried, wanting to believe <mark4>him</mark4><br>
"Yes." "But say more! How can you <mark4>if</mark4><br>
it's sad & dead?" "But that's just <mark1>it!</mark1><br>
If! It isn't. It doesn't want to be <br>
Do you want to be?" He was warming to his song   <br>
"Of course I don't have to put up with <mark4>as</mark4><br>
much as you do these <mark4>days</mark4>, These <mark4>years.</mark4><br>
But I do miss the <mark4>color</mark4>, the <mark4>architecture,</mark4><br>
the talk. You know, it was the <mark4>life!</mark4><br>
And dying is such an insult. After <mark4>all</mark4><br>
I was in love with breath and I <mark5>loved</mark5><br>
embracing those <mark4>others</mark4>, the <mark4>lovers,</mark4><br>
with my body." He sighed & <mark4>laughed</mark4><br>
He wasn't quite as I'd remembered <mark1>him</mark1><br>
Not less generous, but more <mark4>abstract</mark4><br>
Did he even have a voice now, I <mark4>wondered</mark4><br>
or did I think it up in the <mark4>middle</mark4><br>
of this long day, phone in hand now   <br>
dialing <mark1>Manhattan</mark1><br>
