Title : The Campus on the Hill <br>
Author : W. D. Snodgrass <br><br>

Up the reputable walks of old established <mark4>trees</mark4><br>
They stalk, children of the nouveaux <mark4>riches</mark4>, <mark4>chimes</mark4><br>
Of the tall Clock Tower drench their heads in <mark4>blessing:</mark4><br>
"I don't wanna play at your <mark4>house;</mark4><br>
I don't like you any <mark3>more."</mark3><br>
My house stands opposite, on the other <mark4>hill,</mark4><br>
Among meadows, with the orchard fences down and <mark4>falling;</mark4><br>
Deer come almost to the <mark3>door.</mark3><br>
You cannot see it, even in this clearest <mark4>morning.</mark4><br>
White birds hang in the air <mark4>between</mark4><br>
Over the garbage landfill and those homes thereto <mark4>adjacent,</mark4><br>
Hovering slowly, turning, settling <mark4>down</mark4><br>
Like the flakes sifting imperceptibly onto the little <mark3>town</mark3><br>
In a waterball of <mark4>glass.</mark4><br>
And yet, this morning, beyond this quiet <mark4>scene,</mark4><br>
The floating birds, the backyards of the <mark4>poor,</mark4><br>
Beyond the shopping plaza, the dead canal, the hillside lying tilted in the <mark4>air,</mark4><br>
<br>
Tomorrow has broken out <mark3>today:</mark3><br>
Riot in Algeria, in Cyprus, in Alabama; <br>
Aged in <mark4>wrong</mark4>, the empires are <mark4>declining,</mark4><br>
And China gathers, soundlessly, like <mark4>evidence.</mark4><br>
What shall I say to the young on such a <mark1>morning?--</mark1><br>
Mind is the one salvation?--also grammar?-- <br>
No; my little ones lean not toward revolt. <mark3>They</mark3><br>
Are the Whites, the vaguely furiously driven, who <mark4>resist</mark4><br>
Their souls with such <mark4>passivity</mark4><br>
As would make Quakers swear. All day, dear Lord, all <mark3>day</mark3><br>
They wear their godhead <mark4>lightly.</mark4><br>
They look out from their hill and <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
To themselves, "We have nowhere to go but <mark1>down;</mark1><br>
The great destination is to <mark3>stay."</mark3><br>
Surely the nations will be <mark4>reasonable;</mark4><br>
They look at the world--don't they?--the world's <mark3>way?</mark3><br>
The clock just now has nothing more to <mark1>say.</mark1><br>
