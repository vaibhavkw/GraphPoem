Title : Ring Out Your Bells <br>
Author : Sir Philip Sidney <br><br>

Ring out your bells, let mourning shows be <mark3>spread;</mark3><br>
For Love is <mark3>dead?</mark3><br>
All love is <mark4>dead</mark4>, <mark4>infected</mark4><br>
With plague of deep <mark3>disdain;</mark3><br>
Worth, as nought worth, <mark3>rejected,</mark3><br>
And Faith fair scorn doth <mark3>gain.</mark3><br>
From so ungrateful <mark4>fancy,</mark4><br>
From such a female <mark1>franzy,</mark1><br>
From them that use men <mark3>thus,</mark3><br>
Good Lord, deliver <mark3>us!</mark3><br>
<br>
Weep, neighbours, weep; do you not hear it <mark4>said</mark4><br>
That Love is <mark1>dead?</mark1><br>
His death-bed, peacock's <mark4>folly;</mark4><br>
His winding-sheet is <mark3>shame;</mark3><br>
His will, false-seeming <mark4>holy;</mark4><br>
His sole exec'tor, <mark3>blame.</mark3><br>
From so ungrateful <mark1>fancy,</mark1><br>
From such a female <mark1>franzy,</mark1><br>
From them that use men <mark1>thus,</mark1><br>
Good Lord, deliver <mark1>us!</mark1><br>
<br>
Let dirge be sung and trentals rightly <mark3>read,</mark3><br>
For Love is <mark1>dead;</mark1><br>
      Sir Wrong his tomb ordaineth<br>
My mistress' marble <mark3>heart,</mark3><br>
      Which epitaph containeth,<br>
"Her eyes were once his <mark3>dart."</mark3><br>
From so ungrateful <mark1>fancy,</mark1><br>
From such a female <mark1>franzy,</mark1><br>
From them that use men <mark1>thus,</mark1><br>
Good Lord, deliver <mark1>us!</mark1><br>
<br>
Alas, I lie, rage hath this error <mark3>bred;</mark3><br>
Love is not <mark1>dead;</mark1><br>
      Love is not dead, but sleepeth<br>
In her unmatched <mark4>mind,</mark4><br>
      Where she his counsel keepeth,<br>
Till due desert she <mark3>find.</mark3><br>
Therefore from so vile <mark1>fancy,</mark1><br>
To call such wit a <mark1>franzy,</mark1><br>
Who Love can temper <mark1>thus,</mark1><br>
Good Lord, deliver <mark1>us!</mark1><br>
