Title : The King of Owls <br>
Author : Louise Erdrich <br><br>

It is said that playing cards were invented in 1392 to cure the French king, Charles VI, of madness. The suits in some of the first card packs consisted of Doves, Peacocks, <mark4>Ravens</mark4>, and <mark4>Owls.</mark4><br>
They say I am excitable! How <mark4>could</mark4><br>
I not scream? The Swiss monk's tonsure <br>
spun till it blurred yet his eyes were <mark4>still.</mark4><br>
I snapped my gaiter, hard, to stuff <mark4>back</mark4><br>
<br>
my mirth. Lords, he then began to <mark4>speak.</mark4><br>
Indus catarum, he said, presenting the game of <mark4>cards</mark4><br>
in which the state of the world is excellent <mark4>described</mark4><br>
and figured. He decked his mouth <br>
<br>
as they do, a solemn stitch, and left <mark1>cards</mark1><br>
in my hands. I cast them <mark4>down.</mark4><br>
What need have I for <mark4>amusement?</mark4><br>
My brain's a park. Yet your company <br>
<br>
plucked them from the ground and began to play. <br>
Lords, I wither. The monk spoke <mark4>right,</mark4><br>
the mealy wretch. The sorry patterns <mark3>show</mark3><br>
the deceiving constructions of your <mark4>minds.</mark4><br>
<br>
I have made the Deuce of Ravens my <mark4>sword</mark4><br>
falling through your pillows and <mark4>rising,</mark4><br>
the wing blades still <mark4>running</mark4><br>
with the jugular blood. Your bodies lurch <br>
<br>
through the steps of an unpleasant <mark4>dance.</mark4><br>
No lutes play. I have silenced the <mark4>lutes!</mark4><br>
I keep watch in the clipped, convulsed <mark4>garden.</mark4><br>
I must have silence, to hear the messenger's <mark4>footfall</mark4><br>
<br>
in my brain. For I am the King of <mark1>Owls.</mark1><br>
Where I float no shadow <mark4>falls.</mark4><br>
I have hungers, such terrible hungers, you cannot <mark3>know.</mark3><br>
<mark4>Lords</mark4>, I sharpen my talons on your <mark4>bones.</mark4><br>
