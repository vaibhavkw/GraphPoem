Title : On an Infant Dying as Soon as Born <br>
Author : Charles Lamb <br><br>

I saw where in the shroud did <mark3>lurk</mark3><br>
A curious frame of Nature's <mark3>work.</mark3><br>
A flow'ret crushed in the <mark4>bud,</mark4><br>
A nameless piece of <mark4>Babyhood,</mark4><br>
Was in a cradle-coffin <mark3>lying;</mark3><br>
Extinct, with scarce the sense of <mark3>dying;</mark3><br>
So soon to exchange the imprisoning <mark3>womb</mark3><br>
For darker closets of the <mark3>tomb!</mark3><br>
She did but ope an eye, and <mark4>put</mark4><br>
A clear beam forth, then strait up <mark4>shut</mark4><br>
For the long dark: ne'er more to <mark3>see</mark3><br>
Through glasses of <mark4>mortality.</mark4><br>
Riddle of destiny, who can <mark3>show</mark3><br>
What thy short visit meant, or <mark3>know</mark3><br>
What thy errand here <mark3>below?</mark3><br>
Shall we say, that Nature <mark4>blind</mark4><br>
Check'd her <mark4>hand</mark4>, and changed her <mark3>mind,</mark3><br>
Just when she had exactly <mark4>wrought</mark4><br>
A finish'd pattern without <mark4>fault?</mark4><br>
Could she flag, or could she <mark3>tire,</mark3><br>
Or lack'd she the Promethean <mark3>fire</mark3><br>
(With her nine moons' long workings <mark3>sicken'd)</mark3><br>
That should thy little limbs have <mark3>quicken'd?</mark3><br>
Limbs so firm, they seem'd to <mark4>assure</mark4><br>
Life of health, and days <mark3>mature:</mark3><br>
Woman's self in <mark4>miniature!</mark4><br>
Limbs so fair, they might <mark3>supply</mark3><br>
(Themselves now but cold <mark4>imagery)</mark4><br>
The sculptor to make Beauty <mark3>by.</mark3><br>
Or did the stern-eyed Fate descry,<br>
That babe, or mother, one must <mark3>die;</mark3><br>
So in mercy left the <mark4>stock,</mark4><br>
And cut the branch; to save the <mark3>shock</mark3><br>
Of young years widow'd; and the <mark3>pain,</mark3><br>
When Single State comes back <mark3>again</mark3><br>
To the lone man who, 'reft of <mark3>wife,</mark3><br>
Thenceforward drags a maimed <mark3>life?</mark3><br>
The economy of Heaven is <mark4>dark;</mark4><br>
And wisest clerks have miss'd the <mark3>mark,</mark3><br>
Why Human Buds, like this, should <mark4>fall,</mark4><br>
More brief than fly <mark4>ephemeral,</mark4><br>
That has his day; while shrivel'd crones<br>
Stiffen with age to stocks and <mark4>stones;</mark4><br>
And crabbed use the conscience <mark4>sears</mark4><br>
In sinners of an hundred <mark3>years.</mark3><br>
Mother's prattle, mother's <mark3>kiss,</mark3><br>
Baby fond, thou ne'er wilt <mark3>miss.</mark3><br>
Rites, which custom does <mark4>impose,</mark4><br>
Silver bells and baby <mark3>clothes;</mark3><br>
Coral redder than those <mark4>lips,</mark4><br>
Which pale death did late <mark3>eclipse;</mark3><br>
Music framed for infants' <mark3>glee,</mark3><br>
Whistle never tuned for <mark3>thee;</mark3><br>
Though thou want'st not, thou shalt have <mark4>them,</mark4><br>
Loving hearts were they which gave <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
Let not one be missing; <mark4>nurse,</mark4><br>
See them laid upon the <mark3>hearse</mark3><br>
Of infant slain by doom <mark3>perverse.</mark3><br>
Why should kings and nobles <mark4>have</mark4><br>
Pictured trophies to their <mark4>grave;</mark4><br>
And we, churls, to thee <mark3>deny</mark3><br>
Thy pretty toys with thee to <mark3>lie,</mark3><br>
A more harmless <mark4>vanity?</mark4><br>
