Title : Nude Descending <br>
Author : Alicia Ostriker <br><br>

Like a bowerbird trailing a beakful of <mark4>weeds</mark4><br>
Like prize ribbons for the very <mark4>best</mark4><br>
<br>
The <mark4>lover</mark4>, <mark4>producer</mark4><br>
Of another's <mark4>pleasure</mark4><br>
<br>
He whom her swollen lips <mark4>await</mark4><br>
Might wing through any day of the <mark4>decade</mark4><br>
<br>
A form of health <mark4>insurance</mark4><br>
For which it is never too <mark3>late</mark3><br>
<br>
Titanic, silver <mark4>brush</mark4><br>
Hindenburg, of exploding cigars a <mark4>climax</mark4><br>
<br>
The watery below, the fiery above <br>
Ashes of print between--pigment <mark4>between</mark4><br>
<br>
If the crippled woman were to <mark4>descend</mark4><br>
From her bed, her fortress beyond <mark4>midnight</mark4><br>
Downstairs (nude/staircase) to the <mark4>kitchen</mark4><br>
<br>
Naked to sit at the table (writing/thinking) <br>
She might hear the washer spin like a full <mark4>orchestra</mark4><br>
<br>
Complete a cycle like a train <mark4>crash</mark4><br>
Before the fiend would stare through the window   <br>
<br>
Step smoothly into the kitchen, stop some <mark4>clocks.</mark4><br>
Envy shapes a fig tree in one's <mark4>breast,</mark4><br>
<br>
That is, bluntly to say, a <mark4>cancer,</mark4><br>
That is to say <br>
<br>
In a mind, a fertile windy <mark4>field</mark4>, A murdered <mark4>child.</mark4><br>
Well then, fear, primarily of <mark1>falling.</mark1><br>
<br>
Ebony surf toils on the beach, a <mark4>glaze</mark4><br>
At the same moment I am (from a cliff) <mark1>falling</mark1><br>
<br>
The kitchen fiend removes his Dior tie <br>
Places his hand over the <mark4>woman's</mark4><br>
<br>
And softly says: I am the <mark4>lover.</mark4><br>
Now if the crippled woman began to <mark4>dance</mark4><br>
<br>
To pirouette, to rumba <br>
Growling for her <mark1>child</mark1><br>
Her burning page, the devil would be <mark4>shamed</mark4><br>
<br>
(Materialism is not for everyone / Religion <mark4>is</mark4><br>
The extension of politics by other <mark4>means)</mark4><br>
<br>
Would disembody like a wicked smoke   <br>
Back to the status of myth <br>
<br>
Away he'd streak, blue, into <mark4>the--</mark4><br>
O faun, we would finally <mark4>call</mark4>, <mark4>farewell</mark4><br>
<br>
O faun, we would faintly faintly <mark4>call</mark4><br>
O faun, we would, we would <mark4>fondly--</mark4><br>
<br>
She does not dance. She does not <mark4>wish</mark4><br>
To produce another's <mark1>pleasure.</mark1><br>
<br>
They have torn her <mark4>apart</mark4><br>
Into beige <mark4>rectangles.</mark4><br>
