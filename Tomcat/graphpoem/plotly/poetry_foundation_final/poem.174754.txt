Title : Ichabod <br>
Author : John Greenleaf Whittier <br><br>

So fallen! so lost! the light <mark3>withdrawn</mark3><br>
      Which once he wore!<br>
The glory from his gray hairs <mark3>gone</mark3><br>
<br>
Revile him not, the Tempter <mark3>hath</mark3><br>
A snare for <mark3>all;</mark3><br>
And pitying tears, not scorn and <mark3>wrath,</mark3><br>
Befit his <mark3>fall!</mark3><br>
Oh, dumb be passion's stormy <mark3>rage,</mark3><br>
<br>
When he who <mark3>might</mark3><br>
Have lighted up and led his <mark3>age,</mark3><br>
Falls back in <mark3>night.</mark3><br>
Scorn! would the angels laugh, to <mark3>mark</mark3><br>
<br>
A bright soul <mark4>driven,</mark4><br>
Fiend-goaded, down the endless <mark3>dark,</mark3><br>
From hope and <mark4>heaven!</mark4><br>
Let not the land once proud of <mark3>him</mark3><br>
<br>
Insult him <mark3>now,</mark3><br>
Nor brand with deeper shame his <mark3>dim,</mark3><br>
Dishonored <mark3>brow.</mark3><br>
But let its humbled sons, <mark3>instead,</mark3><br>
<br>
From sea to <mark4>lake,</mark4><br>
A long lament, as for the <mark3>dead,</mark3><br>
In sadness <mark3>make.</mark3><br>
Of all we loved and honored, <mark4>naught</mark4><br>
<br>
Save power <mark3>remains;</mark3><br>
A fallen angel's pride of <mark3>thought,</mark3><br>
Still strong in <mark3>chains.</mark3><br>
All else is gone; from those great <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
<br>
The soul has <mark3>fled:</mark3><br>
When faith is lost, when honor <mark3>dies,</mark3><br>
The man is <mark1>dead!</mark1><br>
Then, pay the reverence of old <mark4>days</mark4><br>
<br>
To his dead <mark4>fame;</mark4><br>
Walk backward, with averted <mark3>gaze,</mark3><br>
And hide the <mark3>shame!</mark3><br>
