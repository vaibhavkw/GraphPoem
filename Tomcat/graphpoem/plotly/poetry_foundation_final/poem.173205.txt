Title : I Hid my Love <br>
Author : John Clare <br><br>

I hid my love when young till <mark3>I</mark3><br>
Couldn't bear the buzzing of a <mark3>fly;</mark3><br>
I hid my love to my <mark3>despite</mark3><br>
Till I could not bear to look at <mark3>light:</mark3><br>
I dare not gaze upon her <mark3>face</mark3><br>
But left her memory in each <mark3>place;</mark3><br>
Where'er I saw a wild flower <mark3>lie</mark3><br>
I kissed and bade my love <mark3>good-bye.</mark3><br>
<br>
I met her in the greenest dells,<br>
Where dewdrops pearl the wood <mark4>bluebells;</mark4><br>
The lost breeze kissed her bright blue <mark3>eye,</mark3><br>
The bee kissed and went singing <mark3>by,</mark3><br>
A sunbeam found a passage <mark3>there,</mark3><br>
A gold chain round her neck so <mark3>fair;</mark3><br>
As secret as the wild bee's <mark3>song</mark3><br>
She lay there all the summer <mark3>long.</mark3><br>
<br>
I hid my love in field and <mark3>town</mark3><br>
Till e'en the breeze would knock me <mark3>down;</mark3><br>
The bees seemed singing ballads <mark4>o'er,</mark4><br>
The fly's bass turned a lion's <mark4>roar;</mark4><br>
And even silence found a <mark4>tongue,</mark4><br>
To haunt me all the summer <mark1>long;</mark1><br>
The riddle nature could not <mark4>prove</mark4><br>
Was nothing else but secret <mark4>love.</mark4><br>
