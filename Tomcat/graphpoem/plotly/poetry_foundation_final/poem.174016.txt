Title : Sonnet 19: When I consider how my light is spent <br>
Author : John Milton <br><br>

When I consider how my light is <mark3>spent,</mark3><br>
Ere half my days, in this dark world and <mark3>wide,</mark3><br>
And that one Talent which is death to <mark3>hide</mark3><br>
Lodged with me useless, though my Soul more <mark3>bent</mark3><br>
To serve therewith my Maker, and <mark3>present</mark3><br>
My true account, lest he returning <mark3>chide;</mark3><br>
"Doth God exact day-labour, light <mark3>denied?"</mark3><br>
I fondly ask. But patience, to <mark3>prevent</mark3><br>
That murmur, soon replies, "God doth not <mark4>need</mark4><br>
Either man's work or his own gifts; who <mark4>best</mark4><br>
Bear his mild yoke, they serve him <mark4>best</mark4>, His <mark4>state</mark4><br>
Is Kingly. Thousands at his bidding <mark3>speed</mark3><br>
And post o'er Land and Ocean without <mark4>rest:</mark4><br>
They also serve who only stand and <mark4>wait."</mark4><br>
