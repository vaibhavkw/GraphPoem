Title : Sonnets from the Portuguese 28: My letters! all dead paper, ... mute and white ! <br>
Author : Elizabeth Barrett Browning <br><br>

My letters! all dead paper, ... mute and white ! <mark3>--</mark3><br>
And yet they seem alive and <mark4>quivering</mark4><br>
Against my tremulous hands which loose the <mark4>string</mark4><br>
And let them drop down on my knee <mark3>to-night.</mark3><br>
This said, ... he wished to have me in his <mark3>sight</mark3><br>
Once, as a friend: this fixed a day in <mark3>spring</mark3><br>
To come and touch my hand ... a simple <mark3>thing,</mark3><br>
Yet I wept for it! -- this, ... the paper's light <mark3>...</mark3><br>
Said, Dear, I love thee; and I sank and quailed <br>
As if God's future thundered on my <mark4>past.</mark4><br>
This <mark4>said</mark4>, I am thine -- and so its ink has <mark4>paled</mark4><br>
With lying at my heart that beat too <mark3>fast.</mark3><br>
And this ... O Love, thy words have ill <mark3>availed,</mark3><br>
If, what this said, I dared repeat at <mark3>last!</mark3><br>
