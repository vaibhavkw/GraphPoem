Title : Meditation at Fifty Yards, Moving Target <br>
Author : Rita Dove <br><br>

Safety <mark4>First.</mark4><br>
<br>
Never point your weapon, keep your <mark4>finger</mark4><br>
off the trigger. Assume a loaded <mark4>barrel,</mark4><br>
even when it <mark1>isn't</mark1>, especially when you know it <mark4>isn't.</mark4><br>
Glocks are lightweight but sensitive; <br>
the Keltec has a long pull and a <mark4>kick.</mark4><br>
Rifles have penetrating power, viz.: <br>
if the projectile doesn't lodge in its <mark4>mark,</mark4><br>
it will travel some <mark4>distance</mark4><br>
until it finds shelter; it will certainly <br>
pierce your ordinary drywall <mark4>partition.</mark4><br>
You could wound the burglar and kill your <mark4>child</mark4><br>
sleeping in the next room, all with one <mark4>shot.</mark4><br>
<br>
Open <mark4>Air.</mark4><br>
Fear, of course. Then the <mark4>sudden</mark4><br>
<br>
pleasure of heft--as if the <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
had always yearned for this <mark4>solemn</mark4><br>
fit, this gravitas, and now had <mark4>found</mark4><br>
its true <mark4>repose.</mark4><br>
Don't pull the trigger, squeeze <mark4>it--</mark4><br>
<br>
squeeze between <mark4>heartbeats.</mark4><br>
Look down the sights. <mark4>Don't</mark4><br>
hold your breath. Don't <mark4>hold</mark4><br>
<mark4>anything</mark4>, just stop <mark4>breathing.</mark4><br>
Level the scene with your eyes. <mark4>Listen.</mark4><br>
Soft, now: <mark4>squeeze.</mark4><br>
Gender <mark4>Politics.</mark4><br>
<br>
Guys like noise: rapid <mark4>fire,</mark4><br>
thunk-and-slide of a blunt-nose silver Mossberg, <br>
<br>
or double-handed <mark4>Colts</mark4>, slugging it out from the <mark4>hips.</mark4><br>
Rambo or cowboy, they'll whoop it up. <br>
Women are fewer, more <mark4>elegant.</mark4><br>
They prefer <mark4>precision:</mark4><br>
<br>
tin cans swing-dancing in the <mark3>trees,</mark3><br>
the paper bull's-eye's tidy rupture at fifty <mark4>yards.</mark4><br>
(Question: If you were being <mark4>pursued,</mark4><br>
how would you prefer to go <mark4>down--</mark4><br>
<br>
ripped through a blanket of <mark1>fire</mark1><br>
or plucked by one <mark4>incandescent</mark4><br>
The <mark4>Bullet.</mark4><br>
dark dark no wind no <mark4>heaven</mark4><br>
<br>
i am not anything   not borne on air   i <mark4>bear</mark4><br>
<br>
myself   i can slice the air   no <mark4>wind</mark4><br>
<br>
can hold me   let me   let me <br>
go   i can see   <mark4>yes</mark4><br>
o aperture o light   let me   off <br>
go off   straight is my verb   <mark4>straight</mark4><br>
my glory road   yes   now i can   <mark4>feel</mark4><br>
it the light i am flame   velocity o <br>
beautiful body i am coming i am <mark4>yours</mark4><br>
before you know <mark1>it</mark1><br>
i am <mark4>home</mark4><br>
