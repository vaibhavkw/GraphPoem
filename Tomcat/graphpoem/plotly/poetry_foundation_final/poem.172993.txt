Title : Sonnets from the Portuguese 20: Beloved, my Beloved, when I think <br>
Author : Elizabeth Barrett Browning <br><br>

Beloved, my Beloved, when I <mark3>think</mark3><br>
That thou wast in the world a year <mark3>ago,</mark3><br>
What time I sate alone here in the <mark3>snow</mark3><br>
And saw no footprint, heard the silence <mark3>sink</mark3><br>
No moment at thy voice ... but, link by <mark3>link,</mark3><br>
Went counting all my chains, as if that <mark3>so</mark3><br>
They never could fall off at any <mark3>blow</mark3><br>
Struck by thy possible hand ... why, thus I <mark3>drink</mark3><br>
Of life's great cup of wonder! <mark4>Wonderful,</mark4><br>
Never to feel thee thrill the day or <mark3>night</mark3><br>
With personal act or speech,--nor ever <mark4>cull</mark4><br>
Some prescience of thee with the blossoms <mark3>white</mark3><br>
Thou sawest growing! Atheists are as <mark3>dull,</mark3><br>
Who cannot guess God's presence out of <mark3>sight.</mark3><br>
