Title : A Charm <br>
Author : David Ferry <br><br>

I have a twin who bears my <mark3>name;</mark3><br>
Bears it about with him in <mark3>shame;</mark3><br>
<br>
Who goes a way I would not <mark3>go;</mark3><br>
Has knowledge of things I would not <mark3>know;</mark3><br>
<br>
When I was brave he was <mark4>afraid;</mark4><br>
He told the truth, I <mark4>lied;</mark4><br>
<br>
What's sweet to me tastes bitter to <mark4>him;</mark4><br>
My friends, my friends, he doesn't love <mark4>them;</mark4><br>
<br>
I walk the daylight in his <mark4>dream;</mark4><br>
He breathes the air of my nightmare. <br>
