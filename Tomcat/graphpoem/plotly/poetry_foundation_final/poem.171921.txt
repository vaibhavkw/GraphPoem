Title : The Redeemer <br>
Author : Siegfried Sassoon <br><br>

Darkness: the rain sluiced down; the mire was <mark3>deep;</mark3><br>
It was past twelve on a mid-winter <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
When peaceful folk in beds lay snug <mark3>asleep;</mark3><br>
There, with much work to do before the <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
We lugged our clay-sucked boots as best we <mark3>might</mark3><br>
Along the trench; sometimes a bullet <mark3>sang,</mark3><br>
And droning shells burst with a hollow <mark3>bang;</mark3><br>
We were soaked, chilled and wretched, every <mark3>one;</mark3><br>
Darkness; the distant wink of a huge <mark3>gun.</mark3><br>
<br>
I turned in the black ditch, loathing the <mark3>storm;</mark3><br>
A rocket fizzed and burned with blanching <mark3>flare,</mark3><br>
And lit the face of what had been a <mark3>form</mark3><br>
Floundering in mirk. He stood before me <mark3>there;</mark3><br>
I say that He was Christ; stiff in the <mark3>glare,</mark3><br>
And leaning forward from His burdening <mark3>task,</mark3><br>
Both arms supporting it; His eyes on <mark4>mine</mark4><br>
Stared from the woeful head that seemed a <mark3>mask</mark3><br>
Of mortal pain in Hell's unholy <mark3>shine.</mark3><br>
<br>
No thorny crown, only a woollen <mark4>cap</mark4><br>
He wore--an English soldier, white and <mark4>strong,</mark4><br>
Who loved his time like any simple <mark3>chap,</mark3><br>
Good days of work and sport and homely <mark3>song;</mark3><br>
Now he has learned that nights are very <mark3>long,</mark3><br>
And dawn a watching of the windowed <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
But to the end, unjudging, he'll <mark4>endure</mark4><br>
Horror and pain, not uncontent to <mark3>die</mark3><br>
That Lancaster on Lune may stand <mark3>secure.</mark3><br>
<br>
He faced me, reeling in his <mark4>weariness,</mark4><br>
Shouldering his load of planks, so hard to <mark4>bear.</mark4><br>
I say that He was Christ, who wrought to <mark4>bless</mark4><br>
All groping things with freedom bright as <mark3>air,</mark3><br>
And with His mercy washed and made them <mark3>fair.</mark3><br>
Then the flame sank, and all grew black as <mark3>pitch,</mark3><br>
While we began to struggle along the <mark3>ditch;</mark3><br>
And someone flung his burden in the <mark4>muck,</mark4><br>
Mumbling: 'O Christ Almighty, now I'm <mark3>stuck!'</mark3><br>
