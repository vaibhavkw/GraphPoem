Title : The Lady of Shalott (1842) <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

Part <mark3>I</mark3><br>
On either side the river <mark3>lie</mark3><br>
Long fields of barley and of <mark3>rye,</mark3><br>
That clothe the wold and meet the <mark3>sky;</mark3><br>
And thro' the field the road runs <mark3>by</mark3><br>
To many-tower'd <mark1>Camelot;</mark1><br>
And up and down the people <mark3>go,</mark3><br>
Gazing where the lilies <mark3>blow</mark3><br>
Round an island there <mark3>below,</mark3><br>
The island of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
Willows whiten, aspens <mark3>quiver,</mark3><br>
Little breezes dusk and <mark3>shiver</mark3><br>
Thro' the wave that runs for <mark4>ever</mark4><br>
By the island in the <mark4>river</mark4><br>
Flowing down to <mark1>Camelot.</mark1><br>
Four gray <mark4>walls</mark4>, and four gray <mark4>towers,</mark4><br>
Overlook a space of <mark3>flowers,</mark3><br>
And the silent isle imbowers <br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
By the margin, willow <mark4>veil'd,</mark4><br>
Slide the heavy barges <mark3>trail'd</mark3><br>
By slow horses; and unhail'd <br>
The shallop flitteth silken-sail'd <br>
Skimming down to <mark1>Camelot:</mark1><br>
But who hath seen her wave her <mark3>hand?</mark3><br>
Or at the casement seen her <mark3>stand?</mark3><br>
Or is she known in all the <mark3>land,</mark3><br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott?</mark1><br>
<br>
Only reapers, reaping <mark4>early</mark4><br>
In among the bearded <mark4>barley,</mark4><br>
Hear a song that echoes <mark5>cheerly</mark5><br>
From the river winding <mark4>clearly,</mark4><br>
Down to tower'd <mark1>Camelot:</mark1><br>
And by the moon the reaper <mark4>weary,</mark4><br>
Piling sheaves in uplands <mark4>airy,</mark4><br>
Listening, whispers " 'Tis the <mark3>fairy</mark3><br>
Lady of <mark1>Shalott."</mark1><br>
<br>
Part II <br>
There she weaves by night and <mark3>day</mark3><br>
A magic web with colours <mark3>gay.</mark3><br>
She has heard a whisper <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
A curse is on her if she <mark3>stay</mark3><br>
To look down to <mark1>Camelot.</mark1><br>
She knows not what the curse may <mark4>be,</mark4><br>
And so she weaveth <mark4>steadily,</mark4><br>
And little other care hath <mark3>she,</mark3><br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
And moving thro' a mirror <mark5>clear</mark5><br>
That hangs before her all the <mark3>year,</mark3><br>
Shadows of the world <mark3>appear.</mark3><br>
There she sees the highway <mark3>near</mark3><br>
Winding down to <mark1>Camelot:</mark1><br>
There the river eddy <mark5>whirls,</mark5><br>
And there the surly village-churls, <br>
And the red cloaks of market <mark4>girls,</mark4><br>
Pass onward from <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
Sometimes a troop of damsels <mark4>glad,</mark4><br>
An abbot on an ambling <mark3>pad,</mark3><br>
Sometimes a curly <mark3>shepherd-lad,</mark3><br>
Or long-hair'd page in crimson <mark3>clad,</mark3><br>
Goes by to tower'd <mark1>Camelot;</mark1><br>
And sometimes thro' the mirror <mark3>blue</mark3><br>
The knights come riding two and <mark3>two:</mark3><br>
She hath no loyal knight and <mark3>true,</mark3><br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
But in her web she still <mark3>delights</mark3><br>
To weave the mirror's magic <mark3>sights,</mark3><br>
For often thro' the silent <mark3>nights</mark3><br>
A funeral, with plumes and <mark3>lights</mark3><br>
And music, went to <mark1>Camelot:</mark1><br>
Or when the moon was <mark4>overhead,</mark4><br>
Came two young lovers lately <mark3>wed:</mark3><br>
"I am half sick of shadows," <mark3>said</mark3><br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
Part III <br>
A bow-shot from her <mark4>bower-eaves,</mark4><br>
He rode between the <mark3>barley-sheaves,</mark3><br>
The sun came dazzling thro' the <mark3>leaves,</mark3><br>
And flamed upon the brazen <mark3>greaves</mark3><br>
Of bold Sir <mark3>Lancelot.</mark3><br>
A red-cross knight for ever <mark4>kneel'd</mark4><br>
To a lady in his <mark4>shield,</mark4><br>
That sparkled on the yellow <mark3>field,</mark3><br>
Beside remote <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
The gemmy bridle glitter'd <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
Like to some branch of stars we <mark3>see</mark3><br>
Hung in the golden <mark4>Galaxy.</mark4><br>
The bridle bells rang <mark4>merrily</mark4><br>
As he rode down to <mark1>Camelot:</mark1><br>
And from his blazon'd baldric <mark3>slung</mark3><br>
A mighty silver bugle <mark3>hung,</mark3><br>
And as he rode his armour <mark3>rung,</mark3><br>
Beside remote <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
All in the blue unclouded <mark4>weather</mark4><br>
Thick-jewell'd shone the <mark3>saddle-leather,</mark3><br>
The helmet and the <mark3>helmet-feather</mark3><br>
Burn'd like one burning flame <mark3>together,</mark3><br>
As he rode down to <mark1>Camelot.</mark1><br>
As often thro' the purple <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
Below the starry clusters <mark3>bright,</mark3><br>
Some bearded meteor, trailing <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
Moves over still <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
His broad clear brow in sunlight <mark4>glow'd;</mark4><br>
On burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode; <br>
From underneath his helmet <mark3>flow'd</mark3><br>
His coal-black curls as on he <mark4>rode,</mark4><br>
As he rode down to <mark1>Camelot.</mark1><br>
From the bank and from the <mark1>river</mark1><br>
He flash'd into the crystal <mark4>mirror,</mark4><br>
"Tirra lirra," by the <mark1>river</mark1><br>
Sang Sir <mark1>Lancelot.</mark1><br>
<br>
She left the web, she left the <mark3>loom,</mark3><br>
She made three paces thro' the <mark3>room,</mark3><br>
She saw the water-lily <mark3>bloom,</mark3><br>
She saw the helmet and the <mark3>plume,</mark3><br>
She look'd down to <mark1>Camelot.</mark1><br>
Out flew the web and floated <mark4>wide;</mark4><br>
The mirror crack'd from side to <mark3>side;</mark3><br>
"The curse is come upon me," <mark3>cried</mark3><br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
Part IV <br>
In the stormy east-wind <mark4>straining,</mark4><br>
The pale yellow woods were <mark3>waning,</mark3><br>
The broad stream in his banks <mark3>complaining,</mark3><br>
Heavily the low sky <mark3>raining</mark3><br>
Over tower'd <mark1>Camelot;</mark1><br>
Down she came and found a <mark4>boat</mark4><br>
Beneath a willow left <mark3>afloat,</mark3><br>
And round about the prow she <mark3>wrote</mark3><br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
And down the river's dim <mark4>expanse</mark4><br>
Like some bold seer in a <mark3>trance,</mark3><br>
Seeing all his own mischance-- <br>
With a glassy <mark4>countenance</mark4><br>
Did she look to <mark1>Camelot.</mark1><br>
And at the closing of the <mark1>day</mark1><br>
She loosed the chain, and down she <mark3>lay;</mark3><br>
The broad stream bore her far <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
Lying, robed in snowy <mark4>white</mark4><br>
That loosely flew to left and <mark3>right--</mark3><br>
The leaves upon her falling <mark1>light--</mark1><br>
Thro' the noises of the <mark1>night</mark1><br>
She floated down to <mark1>Camelot:</mark1><br>
And as the boat-head wound <mark4>along</mark4><br>
The willowy hills and fields <mark4>among,</mark4><br>
They heard her singing her last <mark4>song,</mark4><br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
Heard a carol, mournful, <mark4>holy,</mark4><br>
Chanted <mark4>loudly</mark4>, chanted <mark3>lowly,</mark3><br>
Till her blood was frozen <mark3>slowly,</mark3><br>
And her eyes were darken'd <mark3>wholly,</mark3><br>
Turn'd to tower'd <mark1>Camelot.</mark1><br>
For ere she reach'd upon the <mark3>tide</mark3><br>
The first house by the <mark3>water-side,</mark3><br>
Singing in her song she <mark3>died,</mark3><br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
Under tower and <mark4>balcony,</mark4><br>
By garden-wall and <mark4>gallery,</mark4><br>
A gleaming shape she floated <mark1>by,</mark1><br>
Dead-pale between the houses <mark3>high,</mark3><br>
Silent into <mark1>Camelot.</mark1><br>
Out upon the wharfs they <mark4>came,</mark4><br>
Knight and burgher, lord and <mark3>dame,</mark3><br>
And round the prow they read her <mark3>name,</mark3><br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
Who is this? and what is <mark4>here?</mark4><br>
And in the lighted palace <mark1>near</mark1><br>
Died the sound of royal <mark3>cheer;</mark3><br>
And they cross'd themselves for <mark3>fear,</mark3><br>
All the knights at <mark1>Camelot:</mark1><br>
But Lancelot mused a little <mark4>space;</mark4><br>
He said, "She has a lovely <mark3>face;</mark3><br>
God in his mercy lend her <mark3>grace,</mark3><br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott."</mark1><br>
