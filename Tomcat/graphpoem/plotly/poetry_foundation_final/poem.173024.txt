Title : My Last Duchess <br>
Author : Robert Browning <br><br>

<br>
That's my last Duchess painted on the <mark3>wall,</mark3><br>
Looking as if she were alive. I <mark3>call</mark3><br>
That piece a wonder, now; Fra Pandolf's <mark3>hands</mark3><br>
Worked busily a day, and there she <mark3>stands.</mark3><br>
Will't please you sit and look at her? I <mark3>said</mark3><br>
"Fra Pandolf" by design, for never <mark3>read</mark3><br>
Strangers like you that pictured <mark4>countenance,</mark4><br>
The depth and passion of its earnest <mark4>glance,</mark4><br>
But to myself they turned (since none puts <mark3>by</mark3><br>
The curtain I have drawn for you, but <mark3>I)</mark3><br>
And seemed as they would ask me, if they <mark3>durst,</mark3><br>
How such a glance came there; so, not the <mark3>first</mark3><br>
Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, 'twas <mark4>not</mark4><br>
Her husband's presence only, called that <mark3>spot</mark3><br>
Of joy into the Duchess' cheek; <mark4>perhaps</mark4><br>
Fra Pandolf chanced to say, "Her mantle <mark3>laps</mark3><br>
Over my lady's wrist too much," or <mark4>"Paint</mark4><br>
Must never hope to reproduce the <mark3>faint</mark3><br>
Half-flush that dies along her throat." Such <mark3>stuff</mark3><br>
Was courtesy, she thought, and cause <mark3>enough</mark3><br>
For calling up that spot of joy. She <mark4>had</mark4><br>
A heart--how shall I say?-- too soon made <mark3>glad,</mark3><br>
Too easily impressed; she liked <mark4>whate'er</mark4><br>
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. <br>
Sir, 'twas all one! My favour at her <mark4>breast,</mark4><br>
The dropping of the daylight in the <mark3>West,</mark3><br>
The bough of cherries some officious <mark4>fool</mark4><br>
Broke in the orchard for her, the white <mark3>mule</mark3><br>
She rode with round the terrace--all and <mark3>each</mark3><br>
Would draw from her alike the approving <mark3>speech,</mark3><br>
Or blush, at <mark4>least</mark4>, She thanked men--good! but <mark4>thanked</mark4><br>
Somehow--I know not how--as if she <mark3>ranked</mark3><br>
My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old <mark3>name</mark3><br>
With anybody's gift. Who'd stoop to <mark3>blame</mark3><br>
This sort of trifling? Even had you <mark4>skill</mark4><br>
In speech--which I have not--to make your <mark3>will</mark3><br>
Quite clear to such an one, and say, "Just <mark4>this</mark4><br>
Or that in you disgusts me; here you <mark3>miss,</mark3><br>
Or there exceed the mark"--and if she <mark4>let</mark4><br>
Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly <mark3>set</mark3><br>
Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made <mark4>excuse--</mark4><br>
E'en then would be some stooping; and I <mark3>choose</mark3><br>
Never to stoop. Oh, sir, she smiled, no <mark4>doubt,</mark4><br>
Whene'er I passed her; but who passed <mark3>without</mark3><br>
Much the same smile? This grew; I gave <mark4>commands;</mark4><br>
Then all smiles stopped together. There she <mark1>stands</mark1><br>
As if alive. Will't please you rise? We'll <mark4>meet</mark4><br>
The company below, then. I <mark3>repeat,</mark3><br>
The Count your master's known munificence <br>
Is ample warrant that no just <mark4>pretense</mark4><br>
Of mine for dowry will be <mark4>disallowed;</mark4><br>
Though his fair daughter's self, as I <mark3>avowed</mark3><br>
At starting, is my object. Nay, we'll <mark3>go</mark3><br>
Together down, sir. Notice Neptune, <mark3>though,</mark3><br>
Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity, <br>
Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!<br>
