Title : Recollections of the Arabian Nights <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

When the breeze of a joyful dawn blew <mark3>free</mark3><br>
In the silken sail of <mark4>infancy,</mark4><br>
The tide of time flow'd back with <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
The forward-flowing tide of <mark3>time;</mark3><br>
And many a sheeny <mark3>summer-morn,</mark3><br>
Adown the Tigris I was <mark3>borne,</mark3><br>
By Bagdat's shrines of fretted <mark3>gold,</mark3><br>
High-walled gardens green and <mark3>old;</mark3><br>
True Mussulman was I and <mark3>sworn,</mark3><br>
For it was in the golden <mark3>prime</mark3><br>
Of good Haroun <mark1>Alraschid.</mark1><br>
<br>
Anight my shallop, rustling thro'<br>
The low and bloomed foliage, <mark3>drove</mark3><br>
The fragrant, glistening deeps, and <mark5>clove</mark5><br>
The citron-shadows in the blue:<br>
By garden porches on the <mark4>brim,</mark4><br>
The costly doors flung open <mark4>wide,</mark4><br>
Gold glittering thro' lamplight <mark3>dim,</mark3><br>
And broider'd sofas on each <mark3>side:</mark3><br>
In sooth it was a goodly <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
For it was in the golden <mark1>prime</mark1><br>
Of good Haroun <mark1>Alraschid.</mark1><br>
<br>
Often, where clear-stemm'd platans <mark4>guard</mark4><br>
The outlet, did I turn away<br>
The boat-head down a broad <mark4>canal</mark4><br>
From the main river sluiced, where <mark4>all</mark4><br>
The sloping of the moon-lit <mark4>sward</mark4><br>
Was damask-work, and deep <mark5>inlay</mark5><br>
Of braided blooms unmown, which <mark3>crept</mark3><br>
Adown to where the water <mark3>slept.</mark3><br>
A goodly place, a goodly <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
For it was in the golden <mark1>prime</mark1><br>
Of good Haroun <mark1>Alraschid.</mark1><br>
<br>
A motion from the river <mark4>won</mark4><br>
Ridged the smooth level, bearing <mark3>on</mark3><br>
My shallop thro' the star-strown <mark4>calm,</mark4><br>
Until another night in <mark4>night</mark4><br>
I enter'd, from the clearer <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
Imbower'd vaults of pillar'd <mark3>palm,</mark3><br>
Imprisoning sweets, which, as they <mark5>clomb</mark5><br>
Heavenward, were stay'd beneath the <mark4>dome</mark4><br>
Of hollow boughs.--A goodly <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
For it was in the golden <mark1>prime</mark1><br>
Of good Haroun <mark1>Alraschid.</mark1><br>
<br>
Still onward; and the clear <mark1>canal</mark1><br>
Is rounded to as clear a <mark3>lake.</mark3><br>
From the green rivage many a <mark4>fall</mark4><br>
Of diamond rillets <mark4>musical,</mark4><br>
Thro' little crystal arches <mark3>low</mark3><br>
Down from the central fountain's <mark3>flow</mark3><br>
Fall'n silver-chiming, seem'd to <mark3>shake</mark3><br>
The sparkling flints beneath the prow.<br>
A goodly place, a goodly <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
For it was in the golden <mark1>prime</mark1><br>
Of good Haroun <mark1>Alraschid.</mark1><br>
<br>
Above thro' many a bowery <mark4>turn</mark4><br>
A walk with vary-colour'd <mark3>shells</mark3><br>
Wander'd engrain'd. On either <mark1>side</mark1><br>
All round about the fragrant <mark3>marge</mark3><br>
From fluted vase, and brazen <mark3>urn</mark3><br>
In order, eastern flowers <mark3>large,</mark3><br>
Some dropping low their crimson <mark3>bells</mark3><br>
<mark4>Half-closed</mark4>, and others studded <mark1>wide</mark1><br>
With disks and tiars, fed the <mark1>time</mark1><br>
With odour in the golden <mark1>prime</mark1><br>
Of good Haroun <mark1>Alraschid.</mark1><br>
<br>
Far off, and where the <mark3>lemon-grove</mark3><br>
In closest coverture upsprung,<br>
The living airs of middle <mark1>night</mark1><br>
Died round the bulbul as he sung;<br>
Not he: but something which <mark4>possess'd</mark4><br>
The darkness of the world, <mark3>delight,</mark3><br>
Life, anguish, death, immortal <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
Ceasing not, mingled, unrepress'd,<br>
Apart from place, withholding <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
But flattering the golden <mark1>prime</mark1><br>
Of good Haroun <mark1>Alraschid.</mark1><br>
<br>
Black the garden-bowers and grots<br>
Slumber'd: the solemn palms were <mark4>ranged</mark4><br>
Above, unwoo'd of summer <mark4>wind:</mark4><br>
A sudden splendour from <mark3>behind</mark3><br>
Flush'd all the leaves with rich <mark4>gold-green,</mark4><br>
And, flowing rapidly <mark4>between</mark4><br>
Their interspaces, counterchanged<br>
The level lake with <mark4>diamond-plots</mark4><br>
Of dark and bright. A lovely <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
For it was in the golden <mark1>prime</mark1><br>
Of good Haroun <mark1>Alraschid.</mark1><br>
<br>
Dark-blue the deep sphere <mark4>overhead,</mark4><br>
Distinct with vivid stars <mark4>inlaid,</mark4><br>
Grew darker from that <mark4>under-flame:</mark4><br>
So, leaping lightly from the <mark4>boat,</mark4><br>
With silver anchor left <mark3>afloat,</mark3><br>
In marvel whence that glory <mark3>came</mark3><br>
Upon me, as in sleep I <mark4>sank</mark4><br>
In cool soft turf upon the <mark3>bank,</mark3><br>
Entranced with that place and <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
So worthy of the golden <mark1>prime</mark1><br>
Of good Haroun <mark1>Alraschid.</mark1><br>
<br>
Thence thro' the garden I was <mark4>drawn--</mark4><br>
A realm of pleasance, many a <mark4>mound,</mark4><br>
And many a shadow-chequer'd <mark3>lawn</mark3><br>
Full of the city's stilly <mark3>sound,</mark3><br>
And deep myrrh-thickets blowing <mark3>round</mark3><br>
The stately cedar, <mark4>tamarisks,</mark4><br>
Thick rosaries of scented <mark4>thorn,</mark4><br>
Tall orient shrubs, and obelisks<br>
Graven with emblems of the <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
In honour of the golden <mark1>prime</mark1><br>
Of good Haroun <mark1>Alraschid.</mark1><br>
<br>
With dazed vision <mark4>unawares</mark4><br>
From the long alley's latticed <mark4>shade</mark4><br>
Emerged, I came upon the <mark4>great</mark4><br>
Pavilion of the Caliphat.<br>
Right to the carven cedarn <mark4>doors,</mark4><br>
Flung inward over spangled <mark3>floors,</mark3><br>
Broad-based flights of marble <mark4>stairs</mark4><br>
Ran up with golden balustrade,<br>
After the fashion of the <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
And humour of the golden <mark1>prime</mark1><br>
Of good Haroun <mark1>Alraschid.</mark1><br>
<br>
The fourscore windows all <mark4>alight</mark4><br>
As with the quintessence of <mark4>flame,</mark4><br>
A million tapers flaring <mark3>bright</mark3><br>
From twisted silvers look'd to <mark3>shame</mark3><br>
The hollow-vaulted dark, and <mark4>stream'd</mark4><br>
Upon the mooned domes <mark3>aloof</mark3><br>
In inmost Bagdat, till there <mark3>seem'd</mark3><br>
Hundreds of crescents on the <mark3>roof</mark3><br>
Of night new-risen, that marvellous <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
To celebrate the golden <mark1>prime</mark1><br>
Of good Haroun <mark1>Alraschid.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then stole I up, and trancedly<br>
Gazed on the Persian girl <mark4>alone,</mark4><br>
Serene with argent-lidded <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
Amorous, and lashes like to <mark4>rays</mark4><br>
Of darkness, and a brow of <mark4>pearl</mark4><br>
Tressed with redolent <mark4>ebony,</mark4><br>
In many a dark delicious <mark3>curl,</mark3><br>
Flowing beneath her rose-hued <mark3>zone;</mark3><br>
The sweetest lady of the <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
Well worthy of the golden <mark1>prime</mark1><br>
Of good Haroun <mark1>Alraschid.</mark1><br>
<br>
Six columns, three on either <mark1>side,</mark1><br>
Pure silver, underpropt a <mark3>rich</mark3><br>
Throne of the massive ore, from <mark3>which</mark3><br>
Down-droop'd, in many a floating <mark4>fold,</mark4><br>
Engarlanded and <mark4>diaper'd</mark4><br>
With inwrought flowers, a cloth of <mark1>gold.</mark1><br>
Thereon, his deep eye laughter-stirr'd<br>
With merriment of kingly <mark4>pride,</mark4><br>
Sole star of all that place and <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
I saw him--in his golden <mark1>prime,</mark1><br>
THE GOOD HAROUN <mark1>ALRASCHID!</mark1><br>
