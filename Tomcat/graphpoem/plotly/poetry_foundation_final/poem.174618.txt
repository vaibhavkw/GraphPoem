Title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 105 <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

To-night ungather'd let us <mark3>leave</mark3><br>
This laurel, let this holly <mark3>stand:</mark3><br>
We live within the stranger's <mark3>land,</mark3><br>
And strangely falls our <mark3>Christmas-eve.</mark3><br>
<br>
Our father's dust is left <mark4>alone</mark4><br>
And silent under other <mark3>snows:</mark3><br>
There in due time the woodbine <mark3>blows,</mark3><br>
The violet comes, but we are <mark4>gone.</mark4><br>
<br>
No more shall wayward grief <mark4>abuse</mark4><br>
The genial hour with mask and <mark3>mime;</mark3><br>
For change of place, like growth of <mark3>time,</mark3><br>
Has broke the bond of dying <mark3>use.</mark3><br>
<br>
Let cares that petty shadows <mark3>cast,</mark3><br>
By which our lives are chiefly <mark4>proved,</mark4><br>
A little spare the night I <mark4>loved,</mark4><br>
And hold it solemn to the <mark3>past.</mark3><br>
<br>
But let no footstep beat the <mark3>floor,</mark3><br>
Nor bowl of wassail mantle <mark4>warm;</mark4><br>
For who would keep an ancient <mark3>form</mark3><br>
Thro' which the spirit breathes no <mark3>more?</mark3><br>
<br>
Be neither song, nor game, nor <mark4>feast;</mark4><br>
Nor harp be touch'd, nor flute be <mark4>blown;</mark4><br>
No dance, no <mark4>motion</mark4>, save <mark1>alone</mark1><br>
What lightens in the lucid <mark3>east</mark3><br>
<br>
Of rising worlds by yonder <mark4>wood.</mark4><br>
Long sleeps the summer in the <mark4>seed;</mark4><br>
Run out your measured arcs, and <mark3>lead</mark3><br>
The closing cycle rich in <mark4>good.</mark4><br>
