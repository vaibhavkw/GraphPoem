Title : Ah! Sun-flower <br>
Author : William Blake <br><br>

Ah Sun-flower! weary of time, <br>
Who countest the steps of the <mark3>Sun:</mark3><br>
Seeking after that sweet golden clime <br>
Where the travellers journey is <mark3>done.</mark3><br>
<br>
Where the Youth pined away with desire, <br>
And the pale Virgin shrouded in <mark3>snow:</mark3><br>
Arise from their graves and aspire, <br>
Where my Sun-flower wishes to <mark3>go.</mark3><br>
