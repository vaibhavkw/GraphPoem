Title : Mother and Poet <br>
Author : Elizabeth Barrett Browning <br><br>

<br>
Dead ! One of them shot by the sea in the <mark3>east,</mark3><br>
And one of them shot in the west by the <mark3>sea.</mark3><br>
Dead ! both my boys ! When you sit at the <mark3>feast</mark3><br>
And are wanting a great song for Italy <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
Let none look at me <mark3>!</mark3><br>
<br>
Yet I was a poetess only last <mark4>year,</mark4><br>
And good at my art, for a woman, men said <mark3>;</mark3><br>
But this woman, this, who is agonized <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
? The east sea and west sea rhyme on in her <mark3>head</mark3><br>
For ever <mark3>instead.</mark3><br>
What art can a woman be good at ? Oh, vain <mark3>!</mark3><br>
<br>
What art is she good <mark4>at</mark4>, but hurting her <mark4>breast</mark4><br>
With the milk-teeth of babes, and a smile at the pain <mark3>?</mark3><br>
Ah boys, how you hurt ! you were strong as you <mark3>pressed,</mark3><br>
And I proud, by that <mark3>test.</mark3><br>
What art's for a woman ? To hold on her <mark3>knees</mark3><br>
Both darlings ! to feel all their arms round her <mark4>throat,</mark4><br>
<br>
Cling, strangle a little ! to sew by <mark3>degrees</mark3><br>
And 'broider the long-clothes and neat little coat <mark3>;</mark3><br>
         To dream and to doat.<br>
To teach them ... It stings there ! I made them <mark4>indeed</mark4><br>
Speak plain the word country. I taught them, no <mark4>doubt,</mark4><br>
That a country's a thing men should die for at <mark3>need.</mark3><br>
<br>
I prated of liberty, rights, and <mark3>about</mark3><br>
The tyrant cast <mark3>out.</mark3><br>
And when their eyes flashed ... O my beautiful eyes ! <mark4>...</mark4><br>
I exulted ; nay, let them go forth at the <mark4>wheels</mark4><br>
Of the guns, and denied not. But then the <mark4>surprise</mark4><br>
When one sits quite alone ! Then one weeps, then one kneels <mark5>!</mark5><br>
<br>
God, how the house feels <mark4>!</mark4><br>
At first, happy news came, in gay letters moiled<br>
With my kisses, ? of camp-life and glory, and <mark3>how</mark3><br>
They both loved me ; <mark4>and</mark4>, soon coming home to be <mark4>spoiled</mark4><br>
In return would fan off every fly from my <mark3>brow</mark3><br>
With their green <mark3>laurel-bough.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then was triumph at Turin : Ancona was free <mark1>!'</mark1><br>
And some one came out of the cheers in the <mark4>street,</mark4><br>
With a face pale as stone, to say something to <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
My Guido was dead ! I fell down at his <mark3>feet,</mark3><br>
While they cheered in the <mark1>street.</mark1><br>
I bore it ; friends soothed me ; my grief looked <mark3>sublime</mark3><br>
<br>
As the ransom of Italy. One boy <mark4>remained</mark4><br>
To be leant on and walked with, recalling the <mark3>time</mark3><br>
When the first grew immortal, while both of us <mark3>strained</mark3><br>
To the height he had <mark3>gained.</mark3><br>
And letters still came, shorter, sadder, more <mark5>strong,</mark5><br>
Writ now but in one hand, I was not to faint, <mark4>?</mark4><br>
<br>
One loved me for two ? would be with me ere long <mark3>:</mark3><br>
And Viva l' Italia ! ? he died for, our <mark3>saint,</mark3><br>
Who forbids our <mark3>complaint."</mark3><br>
My Nanni would add, he was safe, and <mark4>aware</mark4><br>
    Of a presence that turned off the balls, ? was imprest<br>
It was Guido himself, who knew what I could <mark3>bear,</mark3><br>
<br>
And how 'twas impossible, quite <mark4>dispossessed,</mark4><br>
To live on for the <mark3>rest."</mark3><br>
On which, without pause, up the telegraph <mark4>line</mark4><br>
Swept smoothly the next news from Gaeta : ? <mark4>Shot.</mark4><br>
Tell his mother. Ah, ah,   his, '   their ' mother, ? not   mine, <mark3>'</mark3><br>
No voice says "My mother" again to me. What <mark4>!</mark4><br>
<br>
You think Guido forgot <mark4>?</mark4><br>
Are souls straight so happy that, dizzy with <mark4>Heaven,</mark4><br>
They drop earth's affections, conceive not of woe <mark3>?</mark3><br>
I think not. Themselves were too lately <mark4>forgiven</mark4><br>
Through THAT Love and Sorrow which reconciled <mark3>so</mark3><br>
The Above and <mark3>Below.</mark3><br>
<br>
O Christ of the five wounds, who look'dst through the <mark3>dark</mark3><br>
To the face of Thy mother ! consider, I <mark3>pray,</mark3><br>
How we common mothers stand desolate, <mark3>mark,</mark3><br>
Whose sons, not being Christs, die with eyes turned <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
And no last word to say <mark3>!</mark3><br>
Both boys dead ? but that's out of nature. We <mark3>all</mark3><br>
<br>
Have been patriots, yet each house must always keep <mark4>one.</mark4><br>
'Twere <mark4>imbecile</mark4>, hewing out roads to a wall <mark3>;</mark3><br>
And, when Italy 's made, for what end is it <mark3>done</mark3><br>
If we have not a son <mark3>?</mark3><br>
Ah, ah, ah ! when Gaeta's <mark4>taken</mark4>, what then <mark4>?</mark4><br>
When the fair wicked queen sits no more at her <mark4>sport</mark4><br>
<br>
Of the fire-balls of death crashing souls out of men <mark3>?</mark3><br>
When the guns of Cavalli with final <mark4>retort</mark4><br>
Have cut the game short <mark4>?</mark4><br>
When Venice and Rome keep their new <mark3>jubilee,</mark3><br>
When your flag takes all heaven for its white, green, and <mark4>red,</mark4><br>
When you have your country from mountain to <mark1>sea,</mark1><br>
<br>
When King Victor has Italy's crown on his <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
(And I have my Dead) <mark3>?</mark3><br>
What then ? Do not mock me. Ah, ring your bells <mark3>low,</mark3><br>
And burn your lights faintly ! My country is <mark3>there,</mark3><br>
Above the star pricked by the last peak of snow <mark3>:</mark3><br>
My Italy 's <mark3>THERE</mark3>, with my brave civic <mark3>Pair,</mark3><br>
<br>
To disfranchise despair <mark3>!</mark3><br>
Forgive me. Some women bear children in <mark5>strength,</mark5><br>
And bite back the cry of their pain in self-scorn <mark4>;</mark4><br>
But the birth-pangs of nations will wring us at <mark3>length</mark3><br>
Into wail such as this ? and we sit on <mark3>forlorn</mark3><br>
When the man-child is <mark3>born.</mark3><br>
<br>
Dead ! One of them shot by the sea in the <mark1>east,</mark1><br>
And one of them shot in the west by the <mark1>sea.</mark1><br>
Both ! both my boys ! If in keeping the <mark1>feast</mark1><br>
You want a great song for your Italy <mark1>free,</mark1><br>
Let none look at me <mark1>!</mark1><br>
