Title : The Garden of Proserpine <br>
Author : Algernon Charles Swinburne <br><br>

Here, where the world is <mark3>quiet;</mark3><br>
Here, where all trouble <mark3>seems</mark3><br>
Dead winds' and spent waves' <mark3>riot</mark3><br>
In doubtful dreams of <mark3>dreams;</mark3><br>
I watch the green field <mark3>growing</mark3><br>
For reaping folk and <mark3>sowing,</mark3><br>
For harvest-time and <mark4>mowing,</mark4><br>
A sleepy world of <mark3>streams.</mark3><br>
<br>
I am tired of tears and <mark3>laughter,</mark3><br>
And men that laugh and <mark3>weep;</mark3><br>
Of what may come <mark3>hereafter</mark3><br>
For men that sow to <mark3>reap:</mark3><br>
I am weary of days and <mark4>hours,</mark4><br>
Blown buds of barren <mark3>flowers,</mark3><br>
Desires and dreams and <mark3>powers</mark3><br>
And everything but <mark3>sleep.</mark3><br>
<br>
Here life has death for <mark4>neighbour,</mark4><br>
And far from eye or <mark3>ear</mark3><br>
Wan waves and wet winds <mark3>labour,</mark3><br>
Weak ships and spirits <mark3>steer;</mark3><br>
They drive adrift, and <mark4>whither</mark4><br>
They wot not who make <mark1>thither;</mark1><br>
But no such winds blow <mark3>hither,</mark3><br>
And no such things grow <mark4>here.</mark4><br>
<br>
No growth of moor or coppice, <br>
No heather-flower or <mark3>vine,</mark3><br>
But bloomless buds of <mark4>poppies,</mark4><br>
         Green grapes of Proserpine, <br>
Pale beds of blowing <mark4>rushes</mark4><br>
Where no leaf blooms or <mark3>blushes</mark3><br>
Save this whereout she <mark3>crushes</mark3><br>
For dead men deadly <mark3>wine.</mark3><br>
<br>
Pale, without name or <mark4>number,</mark4><br>
In fruitless fields of <mark4>corn,</mark4><br>
They bow themselves and <mark3>slumber</mark3><br>
All night till light is <mark3>born;</mark3><br>
And like a soul <mark3>belated,</mark3><br>
In hell and heaven unmated, <br>
By cloud and mist <mark3>abated</mark3><br>
Comes out of darkness <mark3>morn.</mark3><br>
<br>
Though one were strong as <mark4>seven,</mark4><br>
He too with death shall <mark3>dwell,</mark3><br>
Nor wake with wings in <mark3>heaven,</mark3><br>
Nor weep for pains in <mark3>hell;</mark3><br>
Though one were fair as <mark4>roses,</mark4><br>
His beauty clouds and <mark3>closes;</mark3><br>
And well though love reposes, <br>
In the end it is not <mark3>well.</mark3><br>
<br>
<mark4>Pale</mark4>, beyond porch and <mark4>portal,</mark4><br>
Crowned with calm <mark4>leaves</mark4>, she <mark4>stands</mark4><br>
Who gathers all things <mark3>mortal</mark3><br>
With cold immortal <mark3>hands;</mark3><br>
Her languid lips are <mark4>sweeter</mark4><br>
Than love's who fears to greet <mark5>her</mark5><br>
To men that mix and meet <mark1>her</mark1><br>
From many times and <mark3>lands.</mark3><br>
<br>
She waits for each and <mark4>other,</mark4><br>
She waits for all men <mark1>born;</mark1><br>
Forgets the earth her <mark3>mother,</mark3><br>
The life of fruits and <mark1>corn;</mark1><br>
And spring and seed and <mark3>swallow</mark3><br>
Take wing for her and <mark3>follow</mark3><br>
Where summer song rings <mark3>hollow</mark3><br>
And flowers are put to <mark3>scorn.</mark3><br>
<br>
There go the loves that <mark4>wither,</mark4><br>
The old loves with wearier <mark4>wings;</mark4><br>
And all dead years draw <mark1>thither,</mark1><br>
And all disastrous <mark3>things;</mark3><br>
Dead dreams of days <mark4>forsaken,</mark4><br>
Blind buds that snows have <mark3>shaken,</mark3><br>
Wild leaves that winds have <mark3>taken,</mark3><br>
Red strays of ruined <mark3>springs.</mark3><br>
<br>
We are not sure of <mark4>sorrow,</mark4><br>
And joy was never <mark4>sure;</mark4><br>
To-day will die to-morrow; <br>
Time stoops to no man's <mark3>lure;</mark3><br>
And love, grown faint and <mark4>fretful,</mark4><br>
With lips but half <mark3>regretful</mark3><br>
Sighs, and with eyes <mark3>forgetful</mark3><br>
Weeps that no loves <mark3>endure.</mark3><br>
<br>
From too much love of <mark4>living,</mark4><br>
From hope and fear set <mark5>free,</mark5><br>
We thank with brief <mark3>thanksgiving</mark3><br>
Whatever gods may <mark3>be</mark3><br>
That no life lives for <mark4>ever;</mark4><br>
That dead men rise up <mark3>never;</mark3><br>
That even the weariest <mark4>river</mark4><br>
Winds somewhere safe to <mark3>sea.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then star nor sun shall <mark3>waken,</mark3><br>
Nor any change of <mark4>light:</mark4><br>
Nor sound of waters <mark1>shaken,</mark1><br>
Nor any sound or <mark3>sight:</mark3><br>
Nor wintry leaves nor <mark4>vernal,</mark4><br>
Nor days nor things <mark3>diurnal;</mark3><br>
Only the sleep <mark3>eternal</mark3><br>
In an eternal <mark3>night.</mark3><br>
