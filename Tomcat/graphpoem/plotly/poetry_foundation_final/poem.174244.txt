Title : Miniver Cheevy <br>
Author : Edwin Arlington Robinson <br><br>

Miniver Cheevy, child of <mark3>scorn,</mark3><br>
Grew lean while he assailed the <mark3>seasons;</mark3><br>
He wept that he was ever <mark3>born,</mark3><br>
And he had <mark3>reasons.</mark3><br>
<br>
Miniver loved the days of <mark3>old</mark3><br>
When swords were bright and steeds were <mark3>prancing;</mark3><br>
The vision of a warrior <mark3>bold</mark3><br>
Would set him <mark3>dancing.</mark3><br>
<br>
Miniver sighed for what was <mark4>not,</mark4><br>
And dreamed, and rested from his <mark4>labors;</mark4><br>
He dreamed of Thebes and <mark4>Camelot,</mark4><br>
And Priam's <mark3>neighbors.</mark3><br>
<br>
Miniver mourned the ripe <mark4>renown</mark4><br>
That made so many a name so <mark4>fragrant;</mark4><br>
He mourned Romance, now on the <mark3>town,</mark3><br>
And <mark4>Art</mark4>, a <mark3>vagrant.</mark3><br>
<br>
Miniver loved the <mark4>Medici,</mark4><br>
Albeit he had never seen <mark4>one;</mark4><br>
He would have sinned <mark4>incessantly</mark4><br>
Could he have been <mark1>one.</mark1><br>
<br>
Miniver cursed the <mark4>commonplace</mark4><br>
And eyed a khaki suit with <mark4>loathing;</mark4><br>
He missed the mediaeval <mark4>grace</mark4><br>
Of iron <mark4>clothing.</mark4><br>
<br>
Miniver scorned the gold he <mark4>sought,</mark4><br>
But sore annoyed was he without <mark4>it;</mark4><br>
Miniver <mark1>thought</mark1>, and thought, and <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
And thought about <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
<br>
Miniver Cheevy, born too <mark4>late,</mark4><br>
Scratched his head and kept on <mark4>thinking;</mark4><br>
Miniver <mark4>coughed</mark4>, and called it <mark3>fate,</mark3><br>
And kept on <mark3>drinking.</mark3><br>
