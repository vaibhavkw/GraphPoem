<br>
Infinity, when all things it <mark4>beheld</mark4><br>
In Nothing, and of Nothing all did <mark4>build,</mark4><br>
Upon what Base was fixt the Lath <mark4>wherein</mark4><br>
He turn?d this Globe, and riggalld it so <mark4>trim?</mark4><br>
Who blew the Bellows of His Furnace <mark3>Vast?</mark3><br>
Or held the Mould wherein the world was <mark3>Cast?</mark3><br>
Who laid its Corner Stone? Or whose <mark4>Command?</mark4><br>
Where stand the Pillars upon which it <mark1>stands?</mark1><br>
Who Lac?de and Fillitted the earth so <mark4>fine,</mark4><br>
With Rivers like green Ribbons Smaragdine?<br>
Who made the Sea's its Selvedge, and it <mark3>locks</mark3><br>
Like a Quilt Ball within a Silver <mark3>Box?</mark3><br>
Who Spread its Canopy? Or Curtains <mark4>Spun?</mark4><br>
Who in this Bowling Alley bowld the <mark3>Sun?</mark3><br>
Who made it always when it rises <mark4>set:</mark4><br>
To go at once both down, and up to <mark3>get?</mark3><br>
Who th' Curtain rods made for this Tapistry?<br>
Who hung the twinckling Lanthorns in the <mark3>Sky?</mark3><br>
Who? who did this? or who is he? Why, <mark3>know</mark3><br>
It's Onely Might Almighty this did <mark3>doe.</mark3><br>
His hand hath made this noble worke which <mark1>Stands</mark1><br>
His Glorious Handywork not made by <mark3>hands.</mark3><br>
Who spake all things from nothing; and with <mark4>ease</mark4><br>
Can speake all things to nothing, if he <mark3>please.</mark3><br>
Whose Little finger at his pleasure <mark4>Can</mark4><br>
Out mete ten thousand worlds with halfe a <mark3>Span:</mark3><br>
Whose Might Almighty can by half a <mark4>looks</mark4><br>
Root up the rocks and rock the hills by th' <mark4>roots.</mark4><br>
Can take this mighty World up in his <mark5>hande,</mark5><br>
And shake it like a Squitchen or a <mark4>Wand.</mark4><br>
Whose single Frown will make the Heavens <mark3>shake</mark3><br>
Like as an aspen leafe the Winde makes <mark3>quake.</mark3><br>
Oh! what a might is this Whose single <mark4>frown</mark4><br>
Doth shake the world as it would shake it <mark3>down?</mark3><br>
Which All from Nothing fet, from Nothing, <mark3>All:</mark3><br>
Hath All on Nothing set, lets Nothing <mark3>fall.</mark3><br>
Gave All to nothing Man indeed, <mark3>whereby</mark3><br>
Through nothing man all might him Glorify.<br>
In Nothing then embosst the brightest <mark4>Gem</mark4><br>
More pretious than all pretiousness in <mark3>them.</mark3><br>
But Nothing man did throw down all by <mark4>Sin:</mark4><br>
And darkened that lightsom Gem in <mark4>him.</mark4><br>
That now his Brightest Diamond is <mark4>grown</mark4><br>
Darker by far than any Coalpit <mark3>Stone.</mark3><br>
