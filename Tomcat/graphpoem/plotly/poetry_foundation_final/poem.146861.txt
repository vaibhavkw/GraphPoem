Title : The Stars Are <br>
Author : Samuel Menashe <br><br>

The stars <mark4>are</mark4><br>
Although I do not sing   <br>
About them--   <br>
The sky and the <mark3>trees</mark3><br>
Are indifferent   <br>
To whom they <mark3>please</mark3><br>
The rose is unmoved   <br>
By my <mark4>nose</mark4><br>
And the garland in your <mark4>hair</mark4><br>
Although your eyes be lakes, <mark4>dies</mark4><br>
<br>
Why sigh for a <mark4>star</mark4><br>
Better bay at the <mark1>moon</mark1><br>
Better bay at the moon . . <mark1>.</mark1><br>
Oh <mark1>moon</mark1>, moon, <mark1>moon</mark1><br>
