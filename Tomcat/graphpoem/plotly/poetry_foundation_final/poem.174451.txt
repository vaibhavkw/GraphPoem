Title : Amoretti III: The Sovereign Beauty <br>
Author : Edmund Spenser <br><br>

The sovereign beauty which I do <mark3>admire,</mark3><br>
Witness the world how worthy to be <mark3>praised:</mark3><br>
The light whereof hath kindled heavenly <mark3>fire</mark3><br>
In my frail spirit, by her from baseness <mark3>raised;</mark3><br>
That being now with her huge brightness <mark3>dazed,</mark3><br>
Base thing I can no more endure to <mark3>view;</mark3><br>
But looking still on her, I stand <mark3>amazed</mark3><br>
At wondrous sight of so celestial <mark3>hue.</mark3><br>
So when my tongue would speak her praises <mark3>due,</mark3><br>
It stopped is with thought's <mark4>astonishment:</mark4><br>
And when my pen would write her titles <mark3>true,</mark3><br>
It ravish'd is with fancy's <mark4>wonderment:</mark4><br>
Yet in my heart I then both speak and <mark4>write</mark4><br>
The wonder that my wit cannot endite.<br>
