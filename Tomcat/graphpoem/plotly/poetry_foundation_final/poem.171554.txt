Author : Michael S. Harper <br><br>

I place these numbed wrists to the <mark4>pane</mark4><br>
watching white uniforms whisk <mark4>over</mark4><br>
him in the <mark4>tube-kept</mark4><br>
<br>
fear what they will do in <mark4>experiment</mark4><br>
watch my gloved stickshifting gasolined <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
breathe boxcar-information-please infirmary <mark4>tubes</mark4><br>
distrusting white-pink mending paperthin   <br>
silkened end <mark4>hairs</mark4>, distrusting <mark1>tubes</mark1><br>
shrunk in his trunk-skincapped <br>
shaven head, in <mark4>thighs</mark4><br>
<br>
on his son who will not make his second <mark4>night</mark4><br>
of this wardstrewn intensive airpocket   <br>
where his father's asthmatic <br>
hymns of <mark4>night-train</mark4>, train done <mark4>gone</mark4><br>
his mother can only know that he has <mark4>flown</mark4><br>
up into essential calm unseen <mark4>corridor</mark4><br>

heartbeat in my infinite distrust of them: <br>
<br>
and of my distrusting self   <br>

panebreaking heartmadness: <br>
nightmare begins <mark5>responsibility.</mark5><br>
