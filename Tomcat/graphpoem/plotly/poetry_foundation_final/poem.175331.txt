There was once a little <mark4>animal,</mark4><br>
No bigger than a <mark3>fox,</mark3><br>
And on five toes he <mark4>scampered</mark4><br>
Over Tertiary <mark3>rocks.</mark3><br>
They called him <mark4>Eohippus,</mark4><br>
And they called him very <mark4>small,</mark4><br>
And they thought him of no value --<br>
When they thought of him at <mark3>all;</mark3><br>
For the lumpish old Dinoceras<br>
And Coryphodon so <mark3>slow</mark3><br>
Were the heavy <mark4>aristocracy</mark4><br>
In days of long <mark3>ago.</mark3><br>
<br>
Said the little <mark1>Eohippus,</mark1><br>
"I am going to be a <mark4>horse!</mark4><br>
And on my middle <mark4>finger-nails</mark4><br>
To run my earthly <mark3>course!</mark3><br>
I'm going to have a flowing <mark4>tail!</mark4><br>
I'm going to have a <mark3>mane!</mark3><br>
I'm going to stand fourteen hands <mark5>high</mark5><br>
On the psychozoic <mark3>plain!"</mark3><br>
<br>
The Coryphodon was <mark4>horrified,</mark4><br>
The Dinoceras was <mark3>shocked;</mark3><br>
And they chased young <mark1>Eohippus,</mark1><br>
But he skipped away and <mark3>mocked.</mark3><br>
Then they laughed enormous <mark4>laughter,</mark4><br>
And they groaned enormous <mark4>groans.</mark4><br>
And they bade young <mark1>Eohippus</mark1><br>
Go view his father's <mark3>bones.</mark3><br>
Said they, "You always were as <mark1>small</mark1><br>
And mean as now we <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
And that's conclusive <mark4>evidence</mark4><br>
That you're always going to <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
What! Be a great, tall, handsome <mark4>beast,</mark4><br>
With hoofs to gallop <mark4>on?</mark4><br>
Why! You'd have to change your <mark4>nature!</mark4><br>
      Said the Loxolophodon.<br>
They considered him disposed <mark4>of,</mark4><br>
And retired with gait <mark4>serene;</mark4><br>
That was the way they <mark4>argued</mark4><br>
In "the early <mark4>Eocene".</mark4><br>
There was once an Anthropoidal <mark5>Ape,</mark5><br>
Far smarter than the <mark4>rest,</mark4><br>
And everything that they could do<br>
He always did the <mark3>best;</mark3><br>
So they naturally disliked <mark1>him</mark1><br>
And they gave him shoulders <mark4>cool,</mark4><br>
And when they had to mention <mark1>him</mark1><br>
They said he was a <mark3>fool.</mark3><br>
<br>
Cried this pretentious Ape one <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
"I'm going to be a <mark4>man!</mark4><br>
And stand upright, and <mark4>hunt</mark4>, and <mark4>fight,</mark4><br>
And conquer all I <mark3>can!</mark3><br>
I'm going to cut down forest <mark4>trees,</mark4><br>
To make my houses <mark4>higher!</mark4><br>
I'm going to kill the <mark4>Mastodon!</mark4><br>
I'm going to make a <mark3>fire!"</mark3><br>
<br>
Loud screamed the Anthropoidal <mark4>Apes</mark4><br>
With laughter wild and <mark3>gay;</mark3><br>
They tried to catch that boastful <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
But he always got <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
So they yelled at him in <mark4>chorus,</mark4><br>
Which he minded not a <mark4>whit;</mark4><br>
And they pelted him with <mark4>cocoanuts,</mark4><br>
Which didn't seem to <mark3>hit.</mark3><br>
And then they gave him <mark4>reasons</mark4><br>
Which they thought of much <mark4>avail,</mark4><br>
To prove how his <mark4>preposterous</mark4><br>
Attempt was sure to <mark3>fail.</mark3><br>
Said the sages, "In the first <mark4>place,</mark4><br>
The thing cannot be <mark3>done!</mark3><br>
And, second, if it could <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
It would not be any <mark3>fun!</mark3><br>
And, third, and most <mark4>conclusive,</mark4><br>
And admitting no <mark3>reply,</mark3><br>
You would have to change your <mark1>nature!</mark1><br>
We should like to see you <mark3>try!"</mark3><br>
They chuckled then <mark4>triumphantly,</mark4><br>
These lean and hairy <mark4>shapes,</mark4><br>
For these things passed as <mark4>arguments</mark4><br>
With the Anthropoidal <mark1>Apes.</mark1><br>
<br>
There was once a Neolithic <mark1>Man,</mark1><br>
An enterprising <mark4>wight,</mark4><br>
Who made his chopping <mark4>implements</mark4><br>
Unusually <mark3>bright.</mark3><br>
Unusually clever <mark3>he,</mark3><br>
Unusually <mark4>brave,</mark4><br>
And he drew delightful <mark4>Mammoths</mark4><br>
On the borders of his <mark3>cave.</mark3><br>
To his Neolithic <mark4>neighbours,</mark4><br>
Who were startled and <mark4>surprised,</mark4><br>
Said he, "My friends, in course of <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
We shall be <mark4>civilized!</mark4><br>
We are going to live in <mark4>cities!</mark4><br>
We are going to fight in <mark4>wars!</mark4><br>
We are going to eat three times a <mark1>day</mark1><br>
Without the natural <mark4>cause!</mark4><br>
We are going to turn life upside <mark4>down</mark4><br>
About a thing called <mark4>gold!</mark4><br>
We are going to want the earth, and take<br>
As much as we can <mark3>hold!</mark3><br>
We are going to wear great piles of <mark4>stuff</mark4><br>
Outside our proper <mark4>skins!</mark4><br>
We are going to have <mark4>Diseases!</mark4><br>
And Accomplishments!! And <mark4>Sins!!!"</mark4><br>
<br>
Then they all rose up in <mark4>fury</mark4><br>
Against their boastful <mark4>friend,</mark4><br>
For prehistoric <mark4>patience</mark4><br>
Cometh quickly to an <mark3>end.</mark3><br>
Said one, "This is <mark4>chimerical!</mark4><br>
Utopian! <mark4>Absurd!"</mark4><br>
Said another, "What a stupid <mark4>life!</mark4><br>
Too dull, upon my <mark3>word!"</mark3><br>
Cried all, Before such things can <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
You idiotic <mark4>child,</mark4><br>
You must alter Human <mark1>Nature!"</mark1><br>
And they all sat back and <mark3>smiled.</mark3><br>
Thought they, "An answer to that <mark4>last</mark4><br>
It will be hard to <mark4>find!"</mark4><br>
It was a clinching <mark4>argument</mark4><br>
To the Neolithic <mark3>Mind!</mark3><br>
