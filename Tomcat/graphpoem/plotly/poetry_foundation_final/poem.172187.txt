Title : The Journey <br>
Author : David Ignatow <br><br>

I am looking for a past   <br>
I can rely <mark1>on</mark1><br>
in order to look to death   <br>
with <mark4>equanimity.</mark4><br>
What was given <mark1>me:</mark1><br>
my mother's largeness   <br>
to protect <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
my father's <mark4>regularity</mark4><br>
in coming home from <mark4>work</mark4><br>
at night, his opening the door   <br>
silently and smiling,   <br>
pleased to be <mark4>back</mark4><br>
and the lights <mark1>on</mark1><br>
in all the <mark4>rooms</mark4><br>
through which I could <mark4>run</mark4><br>
freely or sit at <mark4>ease</mark4><br>
at table and do my <mark4>homework</mark4><br>
undisturbed: love arranged <br>
as order directed at the next day.   <br>
Going to bed was a <mark4>journey.</mark4><br>
