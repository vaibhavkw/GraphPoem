Title : To One Who Has Been Long in City Pent <br>
Author : John Keats <br><br>

To one who has been long in city <mark3>pent,</mark3><br>
'Tis very sweet to look into the <mark3>fair</mark3><br>
And open face of heaven,--to breathe a <mark3>prayer</mark3><br>
Full in the smile of the blue firmament. <br>
Who is more happy, when, with heart's <mark3>content,</mark3><br>
Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant <mark3>lair</mark3><br>
Of wavy grass, and reads a <mark3>debonair</mark3><br>
And gentle tale of love and languishment? <br>
Returning home at evening, with an <mark4>ear</mark4><br>
Catching the notes of Philomel,--an <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
Watching the sailing cloudlet's bright <mark3>career,</mark3><br>
He mourns that day so soon has glided <mark3>by:</mark3><br>
E'en like the passage of an angel's <mark3>tear</mark3><br>
         That falls through the clear ether silently. <br>
