Title : You That I Loved <br>
Author : A. F. Moritz <br><br>

You that I loved all my life <mark4>long,</mark4><br>
you are not the <mark5>one.</mark5><br>
You that I followed, my line or path or way, <br>
that I followed singing, and <mark3>you</mark3><br>
earth and air of the world the way went <mark3>through,</mark3><br>
and you who stood around it so it could <mark3>be</mark3><br>
the way, you forests and <mark4>cities,</mark4><br>
you deer and opossums struck by the lonely <mark4>hunter</mark4><br>
and left decaying, you paralyzed obese <mark4>ones</mark4><br>
who sat on a falling porch in a deep green <mark4>holler</mark4><br>
and observed me, your bald dog <mark4>barking,</mark4><br>
as I stumbled past in a hurry along my <mark4>line,</mark4><br>
you are not the one. But <mark1>you</mark1><br>
are the one, you that I loved all my life <mark1>long,</mark1><br>
you I still love so in my dying mind <br>
I grasp me loving you when we are <mark4>gone.</mark4><br>
You are the <mark4>one</mark4>, you path or way or <mark1>line</mark1><br>
that winds beside the house where she and I live <mark4>on,</mark4><br>
still longing though long <mark1>gone</mark1><br>
for the health of all forests and <mark1>cities,</mark1><br>
and one day to visit them, <br>
one day be rich and free enough to go and <mark3>see</mark3><br>
the restricted wonders of the <mark3>earth.</mark3><br>
And you are the one, old ladies fated from <mark3>birth</mark3><br>
to ugliness, obesity and <mark3>dearth,</mark3><br>
who sat beside my <mark4>path</mark4><br>
one day as I flashed by. And you are the <mark1>one,</mark1><br>
all tumble-down shacks in disregarded <mark4>hills</mark4><br>
and animals the car on the road <mark3>kills</mark3><br>
and leaves stinking in the <mark3>sun.</mark3><br>
