(excerpt)  From Book I<br>
And so bifel, whan comen was the tyme <br>
Of Aperil, whan clothed is the mede <br>
With newe grene, of lusty Veer the pryme, <br>
And swote smellen floures white and <mark1>rede,</mark1><br>
In sondry wises shewed, as I <mark1>rede,</mark1><br>
The folk of Troie hir observaunces <mark3>olde,</mark3><br>
Palladiones feste for to <mark3>holde.</mark3><br>
<br>
And to the temple, in al hir beste wyse, <br>
In general ther wente many a <mark3>wight,</mark3><br>
To herknen of Palladion the servyse; <br>
And namely, so many a lusty knyght, <br>
So many a lady fressh and mayden <mark3>bright,</mark3><br>
Ful wel arayed, both meste, mene, and <mark1>leste,</mark1><br>
Ye, bothe for the seson and the feste. <br>
<br>
Among thise othere folk was Criseyda, <br>
In widewes habit blak; but natheles, <br>
Right as our firste lettre is now an A, <br>
In beautee first so stood she, makeles; <br>
Hire goodly lokyng gladed al the <mark5>prees.</mark5><br>
Nas nevere yet seyn thing to ben preysed derre, <br>
Nor under cloude blak so bright a sterre <br>
<br>
As was Criseyde, as folk seyde everichone <br>
That hir bihelden in hir blake wede; <br>
And yet she stood ful lowe and stille allone, <br>
Byhynden other folk, in litel <mark4>brede,</mark4><br>
And neigh the dore, ay under shames drede, <br>
Simple of atir and debonaire of chere, <br>
With ful assured lokyng and manere. <br>
<br>
This Troilus, as he was wont to gide <br>
His yonge knyghtes, lad hem up and <mark5>doun</mark5><br>
In thilke large temple on every <mark4>side,</mark4><br>
Byholding ay the ladies of the <mark4>town,</mark4><br>
Now here, now there; for no devoc{.i}oun <br>
Hadde he to non, to reven hym his reste, <br>
But gan to preise and lakken whom hym <mark1>leste.</mark1><br>
<br>
And in his walk ful faste he gan to wayten <br>
If knyght or squyer of his compaignie <br>
Gan for to syke, or lete his eighen baiten <br>
On any womman that he koude espye; <br>
He wolde smyle, and holden it folye, <br>
And seye him thus, "God woot, she slepeth softe <br>
For love of the, whan thou turnest ful ofte! <br>
<br>
"I have herd told, pardieux, of your lyvynge, <br>
Ye loveres, and youre lewed observaunces, <br>
And which a labour folk han in wynnynge <br>
Of love, and in the kepyng which <mark5>doutaunces;</mark5><br>
And whan your preye is lost, woo and penaunces. <br>
O veray fooles! nyce and blynde be <mark3>ye!</mark3><br>
Ther nys nat oon kan war by other <mark3>be."</mark3><br>
<br>
And with that word he gan cast up the <mark3>browe,</mark3><br>
Ascaunces, "Loo! is this naught wisely <mark4>spoken?"</mark4><br>
At which the god of love gan loken <mark3>rowe</mark3><br>
Right for despit, and shop for to ben wroken. <br>
He kidde anoon his bowe nas naught <mark3>broken;</mark3><br>
For sodeynly he hitte him atte fulle; <br>
And yet as proud a pekok kan he pulle! <br>
<br>
O blynde world, O blynde entenc{.i}oun! <br>
How often falleth al the effect contraire <br>
Of surquidrie and foul <mark5>presumpc{.i}oun;</mark5><br>
For kaught is proud, and kaught is debonaire. <br>
This Troilus is clomben on the staire, <br>
And litel weneth that he moot descenden; <br>
But al-day faileth thing that fooles wenden. <br>
<br>
As proude Bayard gynneth for to skippe <br>
Out of the wey, so pryketh hym his <mark4>corn,</mark4><br>
Til he a lasshe have of the longe whippe; <br>
Than thynketh he, "Though I praunce al byforn <br>
First in the trays, ful fat and newe <mark3>shorn,</mark3><br>
Yet am I but an hors, and horses lawe <br>
I moot endure, and with my feres drawe." <br>
