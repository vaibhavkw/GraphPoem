Title : Mother, I cannot Mind my Wheel <br>
Author : Walter Savage Landor <br><br>

Mother, I cannot mind my <mark3>wheel;</mark3><br>
My fingers ache, my lips are <mark3>dry:</mark3><br>
Oh! if you felt the pain I <mark3>feel!</mark3><br>
But Oh, who ever felt as <mark3>I!</mark3><br>
<br>
No longer could I doubt him <mark3>true;</mark3><br>
All other men may use <mark3>deceit:</mark3><br>
He always said my eyes were <mark3>blue,</mark3><br>
And often swore my lips were <mark3>sweet.</mark3><br>
