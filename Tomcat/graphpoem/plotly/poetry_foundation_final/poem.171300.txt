Title : Arrows <br>
Author : Tony Hoagland <br><br>

When a beautiful woman wakes <mark1>up,</mark1><br>
she checks to see if her beauty is still <mark4>there.</mark4><br>
When a sick person wakes <mark1>up,</mark1><br>
he checks to see if he continues to be sick. <br>
<br>
He takes the first pills in a thirty-pill day,   <br>
looks out the window at a sky <br>
where a time-release sun is <mark4>crawling</mark4><br>
through the milky X ray of a cloud. <br>
<br>
* * * * <mark1>*</mark1><br>
<br>
I sing the body like a burnt-out fuse <mark4>box,</mark4><br>
the wires <mark4>crossed</mark4>, the panel <mark4>lit</mark4><br>
by red malfunction lights, the pistons <mark4>firing</mark4><br>
out of <mark4>sequence,</mark4><br>
the warning sirens blatting in the empty <mark4>halls,</mark4><br>
<br>
and the hero is trapped in a traffic <mark4>jam,</mark4><br>
the message doesn't reach its destination,   <br>
the angel falls down into the body of a dog   <br>
and is <mark4>speechless,</mark4><br>
<br>
tearing at itself with fast white <mark4>teeth;</mark4><br>
and the consciousness twists evasively,   <br>
like a sheet of <mark4>paper,</mark4><br>
traveled by blue tongues of <mark4>flame.</mark4><br>
<br>
* * * * <mark1>*</mark1><br>
<br>
In the famous painting, the <mark4>saint</mark4><br>
looks steadfastly heavenward, <br>
             away from the physical indignity below, <br>
<br>
the fascinating <mark5>spectacle</mark5><br>
    of his own body <br>
bristling with <mark4>arrows;</mark4><br>
he looks <mark1>up</mark1><br>
as if he were already adamantly <mark4>elsewhere,</mark4><br>
exerting that power of <mark4>denial</mark4><br>
the soul is famous <mark4>for,</mark4><br>
that ability to say, "None of this is <mark4>real:</mark4><br>
<br>
Nothing that happened here on <mark4>earth</mark4><br>
and who I thought I <mark4>was,</mark4><br>
and nothing that I did or that was done to me,   <br>
was ever <mark1>real."</mark1><br>
