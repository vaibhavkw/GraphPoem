Title : The Spring <br>
Author : Thomas Carew <br><br>

Now that the winter's gone, the earth hath <mark3>lost</mark3><br>
Her snow-white robes, and now no more the <mark3>frost</mark3><br>
Candies the grass, or casts an icy <mark3>cream</mark3><br>
Upon the silver lake or crystal <mark3>stream;</mark3><br>
But the warm sun thaws the benumbed <mark3>earth,</mark3><br>
And makes it tender; gives a sacred <mark3>birth</mark3><br>
To the dead swallow; wakes in hollow <mark3>tree</mark3><br>
The drowsy cuckoo, and the <mark3>humble-bee.</mark3><br>
Now do a choir of chirping minstrels <mark3>bring</mark3><br>
In triumph to the world the youthful <mark3>Spring.</mark3><br>
The valleys, hills, and woods in rich <mark3>array</mark3><br>
Welcome the coming of the long'd-for <mark3>May.</mark3><br>
Now all things smile, only my love doth lour; <br>
Nor hath the scalding noonday sun the power <br>
To melt that marble ice, which still doth <mark3>hold</mark3><br>
Her heart congeal'd, and makes her pity <mark3>cold.</mark3><br>
The ox, which lately did for shelter <mark3>fly</mark3><br>
Into the stall, doth now securely <mark3>lie</mark3><br>
In open fields; and love no more is <mark4>made</mark4><br>
By the <mark4>fireside</mark4>, but in the cooler <mark3>shade</mark3><br>
Amyntas now doth with his Chloris <mark3>sleep</mark3><br>
Under a sycamore, and all things <mark3>keep</mark3><br>
Time with the season; only she doth <mark4>carry</mark4><br>
June in her eyes, in her heart <mark4>January.</mark4><br>
