Title : Good-bye, and Keep Cold <br>
Author : Robert Frost <br><br>

<br>
This saying good-bye on the edge of the <mark3>dark</mark3><br>
And cold to an orchard so young in the <mark3>bark</mark3><br>
Reminds me of all that can happen to <mark3>harm</mark3><br>
An orchard away at the end of the <mark3>farm</mark3><br>
All winter, cut off by a hill from the <mark3>house.</mark3><br>
I don't want it girdled by rabbit and <mark3>mouse,</mark3><br>
I don't want it dreamily nibbled for <mark4>browse</mark4><br>
By deer, and I don't want it budded by <mark3>grouse.</mark3><br>
(If certain it wouldn't be idle to <mark3>call</mark3><br>
I'd summon grouse, rabbit, and deer to the <mark3>wall</mark3><br>
And warn them away with a stick for a <mark3>gun.)</mark3><br>
I don't want it stirred by the heat of the <mark3>sun.</mark3><br>
(We made it secure against being, I <mark3>hope,</mark3><br>
By setting it out on a northerly <mark3>slope.)</mark3><br>
No orchard's the worse for the wintriest <mark4>storm;</mark4><br>
But one thing about it, it mustn't get <mark3>warm.</mark3><br>
"How often already you've had to be <mark3>told,</mark3><br>
Keep cold, young <mark4>orchard</mark4>, Good-bye and keep <mark3>cold.</mark3><br>
Dread fifty above more than fifty <mark3>below."</mark3><br>
I have to be gone for a season or <mark3>so.</mark3><br>
My business awhile is with different <mark4>trees,</mark4><br>
Less carefully nourished, less fruitful than <mark3>these,</mark3><br>
And such as is done to their wood with an <mark4>axe?</mark4><br>
Maples and birches and tamaracks.<br>
I wish I could promise to lie in the <mark3>night</mark3><br>
And think of an orchard's arboreal <mark3>plight</mark3><br>
When slowly (and nobody comes with a <mark3>light)</mark3><br>
Its heart sinks lower under the <mark4>sod.</mark4><br>
But something has to be left to <mark3>God.</mark3><br>
