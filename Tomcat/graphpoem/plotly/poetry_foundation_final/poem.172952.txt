Title : On the Funeral of Charles the First at Night, in St. George's Chapel, Windsor <br>
Author : William Lisle Bowles <br><br>

The castle clock had tolled <mark4>midnight:</mark4><br>
With mattock and with <mark3>spade,</mark3><br>
And <mark4>silent</mark4>, by the torches' <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
His corse in earth we <mark3>laid.</mark3><br>
<br>
The coffin bore his name, that <mark3>those</mark3><br>
Of other years might <mark3>know,</mark3><br>
When earth its secrets should <mark3>disclose,</mark3><br>
Whose bones were laid <mark3>below.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Peace to the dead" no children <mark3>sung,</mark3><br>
Slow pacing up the <mark3>nave,--</mark3><br>
No prayers were read, no knell was <mark3>rung,</mark3><br>
As deep we dug his <mark3>grave.</mark3><br>
<br>
We only heard the winter's <mark4>wind,</mark4><br>
In many a sullen <mark4>gust,</mark4><br>
As, o'er the open grave <mark3>inclined,</mark3><br>
We murmured, "Dust to <mark3>dust!"</mark3><br>
<br>
A moonbeam from the arch's <mark4>height</mark4><br>
Streamed, as we placed the <mark3>stone;</mark3><br>
The long aisles started into <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
And all the windows <mark3>shone.</mark3><br>
<br>
We thought we saw the banners <mark4>then,</mark4><br>
That shook along the <mark4>walls,</mark4><br>
Whilst the sad shades of mailed <mark3>men</mark3><br>
Were gazing on the <mark3>stalls.</mark3><br>
<br>
'Tis gone! again on tombs <mark4>defaced</mark4><br>
Sits darkness more <mark4>profound;</mark4><br>
And only by the torch we <mark3>traced</mark3><br>
The shadows on the <mark3>ground.</mark3><br>
<br>
And now the chilling, freezing <mark3>air</mark3><br>
Without blew long and <mark4>loud;</mark4><br>
Upon our knees we breathed one <mark3>prayer,</mark3><br>
Where he slept in his <mark3>shroud.</mark3><br>
<br>
We laid the broken marble <mark4>floor,--</mark4><br>
No name, no trace <mark4>appears,--</mark4><br>
And when we closed the sounding <mark3>door,</mark3><br>
We thought of him with <mark3>tears.</mark3><br>
