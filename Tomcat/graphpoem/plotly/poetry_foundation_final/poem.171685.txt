Title : Charon's Cosmology <br>
Author : Charles Simic <br><br>

With only his dim <mark4>lantern</mark4><br>
To tell him where he <mark4>is</mark4><br>
And every time a <mark4>mountain</mark4><br>
Of fresh corpses to load <mark4>up</mark4><br>
<br>
Take them to the other <mark4>side</mark4><br>
Where there are plenty more <br>
I'd say by now he must be <mark4>confused</mark4><br>
As to which side is which <br>
<br>
I'd say it doesn't <mark4>matter</mark4><br>
No one complains he's got <br>
Their pockets to go <mark5>through</mark5><br>
In one a crust of bread in another a sausage <br>
<br>
Once in a long while a <mark4>mirror</mark4><br>
Or a book which he <mark4>throws</mark4><br>
Overboard into the dark <mark4>river</mark4><br>
Swift and cold and <mark4>deep</mark4><br>
