Title : The To-be-forgotten <br>
Author : Thomas Hardy <br><br>

<br>
I heard a small sad <mark3>sound,</mark3><br>
And stood awhile among the tombs <mark3>around:</mark3><br>
"Wherefore, old friends," said I, "are you distrest,<br>
Now, screened from life's <mark4>unrest?"</mark4><br>
<br>
?"O not at being <mark4>here;</mark4><br>
But that our future second death is <mark4>near;</mark4><br>
When, with the living, memory of us numbs,<br>
And blank oblivion <mark4>comes!</mark4><br>
"These, our sped <mark4>ancestry,</mark4><br>
<br>
Lie here embraced by deeper death than <mark3>we;</mark3><br>
Nor shape nor thought of theirs can you descry<br>
With keenest backward <mark3>eye.</mark3><br>
"They count as quite <mark4>forgot;</mark4><br>
They are as men who have existed <mark3>not;</mark3><br>
<br>
Theirs is a loss past loss of fitful <mark3>breath;</mark3><br>
It is the second <mark3>death.</mark3><br>
"We here, as yet, each <mark3>day</mark3><br>
Are blest with dear recall; as yet, can <mark3>say</mark3><br>
We hold in some soul loved <mark4>continuance</mark4><br>
<br>
Of shape and voice and <mark4>glance.</mark4><br>
"But what has been will be <mark3>?</mark3><br>
First memory, then oblivion's swallowing <mark3>sea;</mark3><br>
Like men foregone, shall we merge into <mark4>those</mark4><br>
Whose story no one <mark3>knows.</mark3><br>
<br>
"For which of us could <mark3>hope</mark3><br>
To show in life that world-awakening <mark3>scope</mark3><br>
Granted the few whose memory none lets <mark3>die,</mark3><br>
            But all men magnify?<br>
"We were but Fortune's <mark4>sport;</mark4><br>
<br>
Things true, things lovely, things of good <mark3>report</mark3><br>
We neither shunned nor sought ... We see our <mark4>bourne,</mark4><br>
And seeing it we <mark3>mourn."</mark3><br>
