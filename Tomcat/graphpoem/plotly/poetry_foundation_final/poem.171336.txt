Title : So This Is Nebraska <br>
Author : Ted Kooser <br><br>

The gravel road rides with a slow <mark4>gallop</mark4><br>
over the <mark4>fields</mark4>, the telephone <mark4>lines</mark4><br>
streaming behind, its billow of <mark4>dust</mark4><br>
full of the sparks of redwing <mark4>blackbirds.</mark4><br>
<br>
On either side, those dear old <mark4>ladies,</mark4><br>
the loosening <mark4>barns</mark4>, their little <mark4>windows</mark4><br>
dulled by cataracts of hay and <mark4>cobwebs</mark4><br>
hide broken tractors under their <mark4>skirts.</mark4><br>
<br>
So this is Nebraska. A Sunday   <br>
afternoon; July. Driving <mark4>along</mark4><br>
with your hand out squeezing the <mark4>air,</mark4><br>
a meadowlark waiting on every <mark4>post.</mark4><br>
<br>
Behind a shelterbelt of <mark4>cedars,</mark4><br>
top-deep in hollyhocks, pollen and <mark4>bees,</mark4><br>
a pickup kicks its fenders off <br>
and settles back to read the <mark4>clouds.</mark4><br>
<br>
You feel like that; you feel like <mark4>letting</mark4><br>
your tires go flat, like letting the <mark4>mice</mark4><br>
build a nest in your muffler, like <mark4>being</mark4><br>
no more than a truck in the <mark4>weeds,</mark4><br>
<br>
clucking with chickens or sticky with honey   <br>
or holding a skinny old man in your <mark4>lap</mark4><br>
while he watches the road, <mark4>waiting</mark4><br>
for someone to wave to. You feel like <br>
<br>
waving. You feel like stopping the <mark4>car</mark4><br>
and dancing around on the road. You wave   <br>
instead and leave your hand out <mark4>gliding</mark4><br>
larklike over the wheat, over the <mark4>houses.</mark4><br>
