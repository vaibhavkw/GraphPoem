Title : D____ L____'s <br>
Author : Albert Goldbarth <br><br>

Fathers are invariably great nuisances on the stage, and always have to give the hero or heroine a long explanation of what was done before the curtain rose, usually commencing with "It is now nineteen years, my dear child, since ..." etc., etc. --Charles <mark4>Dickens</mark4><br>
There might be a <mark4>planet</mark4>, Before <mark4>that,</mark4><br>
though, there would have been a gas that <mark4>coalesced</mark4><br>
into a planet . . . as, before that, there were dots of <mark4>flux</mark4><br>
and energy that hadn't yet declared <mark4>themselves</mark4><br>
in concert. There's always "before": there's <mark1>more</mark1><br>
each minute, more each <mark4>person</mark4>, yes and every <mark4>one</mark4><br>
of its smallest, irreducible subparticles--which I <mark4>name</mark4><br>
the "beforeon"--is exerting force on <mark4>us</mark4><br>
that's surely time's own version of gravity: its <mark4>purpose</mark4><br>
is to tug, and to remind us. In the house of second <mark4>marriages,</mark4><br>
<br>
it causes the man to do what he and the woman had <mark4>promised</mark4><br>
they never would: one night while she's asleep, he <mark4>snoops</mark4><br>
her bureau for telltale relics of the mysterious <mark4>Mr.</mark4><br>
Number One. And why, or even <mark4>what</mark4><br>
he hopes to find, he couldn't clearly say: a letter? photo?   <br>
sex toy?--something, some objectified gossip, a <mark4>fossil</mark4><br>
of bygone love. Essentially, we make of our own <mark4>psyches</mark4><br>
a bureau and pay a shrink to snoop; as for the <mark4>moment</mark4><br>
when our neural linkage first began to <mark4>form,</mark4><br>
as for the flavor of the fluids in the womb. . . we're <mark4>all</mark4><br>
<br>
amnesiacs: and our earliest self, just like the <mark4>universe's</mark4><br>
earliest being, is a "phantom limb" with the <mark4>faintest</mark4><br>
mnemonic of starbursts in an otherwise chill void. I have   <br>
a friend D____ L____ (this poem is hers) who, <mark4>orphaned</mark4><br>
as a <mark4>newborn</mark4>, is devoted to learning her <mark4>origin</mark4><br>
as doggedly as any cosmologist tracks light to its source, <mark3>although</mark3><br>
her search (when not pure Internet) is more a <mark4>matter</mark4><br>
of tape-recording the beer-sour stories in sailor <mark4>bars,</mark4><br>
of sifting ashy memories in nursing <mark4>homes,</mark4><br>
one backwards inch of plotline at a time. And yet <mark4>somebody</mark4><br>
<br>
else is waking up this morning with the <mark4>need</mark4><br>
to be detached from any <mark4>history,</mark4><br>
to stand here like a person in a play who <mark4>enters</mark4><br>
onstage from a pool of perfect blankness. <mark4>Then,</mark4><br>
of course, he can start over, minute-zero-of-year-zero,   <br>
unbesmirched. We could have told him that he'd be <mark4>this</mark4><br>
anguished--sneaking in her drawer, below those <mark4>folded</mark4><br>
pastel lozenges of lingerie, uncovering the one <mark5>thing</mark5><br>
that could ruin them. Now he wants only to float (who   <br>
doesn't, sometimes?) in an anti-world: appealing, <mark4>but</mark4><br>
<br>
illusory. We can't unmoor ourselves from linearity,   <br>
no more than any one of us can be a human <mark4>being</mark4><br>
unconnected to a genome--and in fact, no <mark1>more</mark1><br>
than Mama-All-of-Time-and-Space-Herself (I <mark4>mean</mark4><br>
the cosmos) can unwrap her vasty body from its <mark4>own</mark4><br>
twelve million years of Big Bang "background <mark4>radiation"</mark4><br>
so it wafts--a tossed off, filmy scarf--far <mark4>elsewhere.</mark4><br>
No; there isn't any "elsewhere." When we sleep   <br>
or simply deepen into quietude enough, the <mark4>voices</mark4><br>
come--the rhythmic, grave, ancestral <mark4>murmur,</mark4><br>
<br>
a woman bearing a ritual clamshell bowl . . <mark4>.</mark4><br>
a man with a done-deal sales contract . . . <mark4>whispers,</mark4><br>
knuckle-rap, cleared throats. . . . Her <mark4>great-grandfather,</mark4><br>
D____ L____ has <mark4>uncovered</mark4>, was a lector--a reader they <mark4>used</mark4><br>
to relieve the tedium of the leaf rollers' <mark4>shifts</mark4><br>
in cigar manufactories. Shakespeare, <mark1>Dickens,</mark1><br>
union tracts, love letters, family diaries . . . . <mark4>He's</mark4><br>
walking through the tobacco aroma; he's setting his <mark4>text</mark4><br>
on his easel; and the story--the only story we <mark3>know,</mark3><br>
the story of Before--is <mark4>recited.</mark4><br>
