Title : The Children of the Poor<br>
Author : Gwendolyn Brooks<br><br>

<br>
People who have no children can be <mark3>hard:</mark3><br>
Attain a mail of ice and <mark4>insolence:</mark4><br>
Need not pause in the fire, and in no <mark4>sense</mark4><br>
Hesitate in the hurricane to <mark3>guard.</mark3><br>
And when wide world is bitten and bewarred <br>
They perish purely, waving their spirits <mark3>hence</mark3><br>
Without a trace of grace or of <mark3>offense</mark3><br>
To laugh or fail, diffident, <mark3>wonder-starred.</mark3><br>
While through a throttling dark we others <mark4>hear</mark4><br>
The little lifting helplessness, the <mark4>queer</mark4><br>
Whimper-whine; whose unridiculous <br>
Lost softness softly makes a trap for <mark4>us.</mark4><br>
And makes a curse. And makes a sugar <mark3>of</mark3><br>
The malocclusions, the inconditions of <mark3>love.</mark3><br>
What shall I give my children? who are <mark4>poor,</mark4><br>
<br>
Who are adjudged the leastwise of the <mark4>land,</mark4><br>
<br>
Who are my sweetest lepers, who <mark3>demand</mark3><br>
No velvet and no velvety <mark3>velour;</mark3><br>
But who have begged me for a brisk <mark4>contour,</mark4><br>
Crying that they are quasi, <mark4>contraband</mark4><br>
Because unfinished, graven by a <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
Less than angelic, admirable or <mark4>sure.</mark4><br>
My hand is stuffed with mode, design, <mark4>device.</mark4><br>
But I lack access to my proper <mark3>stone.</mark3><br>
And plenitude of plan shall not <mark3>suffice</mark3><br>
Nor grief nor love shall be enough <mark3>alone</mark3><br>
To ratify my little halves who <mark4>bear</mark4><br>
Across an autumn freezing <mark4>everywhere.</mark4><br>
And shall I prime my children, <mark1>pray</mark1>, to <mark1>pray?</mark1><br>
Mites, come invade most frugal vestibules <br>
<br>
Spectered with crusts of penitents' <mark4>renewals</mark4><br>
<br>
And all hysterics arrogant for a <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
Instruct yourselves here is no devil to <mark3>pay.</mark3><br>
Children, confine your lights in jellied <mark4>rules;</mark4><br>
Resemble <mark4>graves</mark4>, be metaphysical <mark3>mules.</mark3><br>
Learn Lord will not distort nor leave the <mark3>fray.</mark3><br>
Behind the scurryings of your neat <mark3>motif</mark3><br>
I shall wait, if you wish: revise the <mark3>psalm</mark3><br>
If that should frighten you: sew up <mark3>belief</mark3><br>
If that should tear: turn, singularly <mark3>calm</mark3><br>
At forehead and at fingers rather <mark4>wise,</mark4><br>
Holding the bandage ready for your <mark3>eyes.</mark3><br>
