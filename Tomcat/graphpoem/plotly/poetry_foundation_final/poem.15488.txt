Title : Prison Song<br>
Author : Alan Dugan<br><br>

The skin ripples over my body like moon-wooed <mark4>water,</mark4><br>
rearing to escape me. Where could it find <mark4>another</mark4><br>
animal as naked as the one it hates to <mark4>cover?</mark4><br>
Once it told me what was happening outside,<br>
who was attacking, who caressing, and what the air<br>
was doing to feed or freeze me. Now I wake up<br>
dark at night, in a textureless ocean of <mark4>ignorance,</mark4><br>
or fruit bites back and water bruises like a <mark4>stone.</mark4><br>
It's jealousy, because I look for other tools to know<br>
with, and other armor, better girded to my wish.<br>
So let it lie, turn off the clues or try to leave:<br>
sewn on me seamless like those painful <mark4>shirts</mark4><br>
the body-hating saints wore, the sheath of hell<br>
is pierced to my darkness nonetheless: what <mark4>traitors</mark4><br>
labor in my face, what hints they smuggle through<br>
its arching guard! But even in the night it <mark4>jails,</mark4><br>
with nothing but its lies and silences to feed <mark4>upon,</mark4><br>
the jail itself can make a scenery, sing prison <mark4>songs,</mark4><br>
and set off fireworks to praise a homemade day.<br>
