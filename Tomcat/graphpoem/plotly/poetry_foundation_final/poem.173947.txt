Title : The Fair Singer <br>
Author : Andrew Marvell <br><br>

To make a final conquest of all <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
Love did compose so sweet an <mark4>enemy,</mark4><br>
In whom both beauties to my death <mark3>agree,</mark3><br>
Joining themselves in fatal <mark4>harmony;</mark4><br>
That while she with her eyes my heart does <mark3>bind,</mark3><br>
She with her voice might captivate my <mark3>mind.</mark3><br>
<br>
I could have fled from one but singly <mark3>fair,</mark3><br>
My disentangled soul itself might <mark3>save,</mark3><br>
Breaking the curled trammels of her <mark3>hair.</mark3><br>
But how should I avoid to be her <mark3>slave,</mark3><br>
Whose subtle art invisibly can wreath <br>
My fetters of the very air I breathe? <br>
<br>
It had been easy fighting in some <mark3>plain,</mark3><br>
Where victory might hang in equal <mark3>choice,</mark3><br>
But all resistance against her is <mark3>vain,</mark3><br>
Who has th'advantage both of eyes and <mark3>voice,</mark3><br>
And all my forces needs must be <mark4>undone,</mark4><br>
She having gained both the wind and <mark3>sun.</mark3><br>
