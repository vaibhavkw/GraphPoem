Title : The Great Palaces of Versailles <br>
Author : Rita Dove <br><br>

Nothing nastier than a white <mark4>person!</mark4><br>
She mutters as she irons <mark4>alterations</mark4><br>
in the backroom of Charlotte's Dress <mark4>Shoppe.</mark4><br>
The steam rising from a cranberry <mark4>wool</mark4><br>
comes alive with <mark4>perspiration</mark4><br>
and stale Evening of Paris. <br>
Swamp she born from, <mark4>swamp</mark4><br>
she swallow, swamp she got to sink <mark4>again.</mark4><br>
<br>
The iron shoves gently <br>
into a gusset, waits <mark4>until</mark4><br>
the puckers bloom away. <mark4>Beyond</mark4><br>
the curtain, the white girls are <mark4>all</mark4><br>
wearing shoulder pads to make their <mark4>faces</mark4><br>
delicate. That laugh would be Autumn,   <br>
tossing her hair in imitation of <mark3>Bacall.</mark3><br>
<br>
Beulah had read in the library <br>
how French ladies at court would <mark4>tuck</mark4><br>
their fans in a sleeve <br>
and walk in the gardens for air. <mark3>Swaying</mark3><br>
among lilies, lifting shy layers of <mark4>silk,</mark4><br>
they dropped excrement as daintily   <br>
as handkerchieves. Against all <mark4>rules</mark4><br>
<br>
she had saved the lining from a botched <mark4>coat</mark4><br>
to face last year's gray skirt. She <mark4>knows</mark4><br>
whenever she lifts a <mark3>knee</mark3><br>
she flashes crimson. That seems <mark4>legitimate;</mark4><br>
but in the book she had <mark4>read</mark4><br>
how the cavaliere amused <mark4>themselves</mark4><br>
wearing powder and perfume and <mark3>spraying</mark3><br>
yellow borders knee-high on the stucco   <br>
of the Orangerie. <br>
<br>
A hanger clatters <br>
in the front of the <mark1>shoppe.</mark1><br>
Beulah remembers how <br>
even Autumn could lean into a settee <br>
with her ankles crossed, <mark4>sighing</mark4><br>
I need a man who'll protect <mark3>me</mark3><br>
while smoking her cigarette down to the very <mark4>end.</mark4><br>
