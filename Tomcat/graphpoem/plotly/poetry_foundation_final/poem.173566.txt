Title : Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College <br>
Author : Thomas Gray <br><br>

Ye distant <mark4>spires</mark4>, ye antique <mark4>tow'rs,</mark4><br>
That crown the wat'ry <mark3>glade,</mark3><br>
Where grateful Science still <mark4>adores</mark4><br>
Her Henry's holy <mark3>Shade;</mark3><br>
And ye, that from the stately brow <br>
Of Windsor's heights th' expanse <mark3>below</mark3><br>
Of grove, of lawn, of mead <mark3>survey,</mark3><br>
Whose turf, whose shade, whose flowr's <mark4>among</mark4><br>
Wanders the hoary Thames <mark4>along</mark4><br>
His silver-winding <mark3>way.</mark3><br>
<br>
Ah, happy hills, ah, pleasing <mark1>shade,</mark1><br>
Ah, fields belov'd in <mark3>vain,</mark3><br>
Where once my careless childhood <mark4>stray'd,</mark4><br>
A stranger yet to <mark3>pain!</mark3><br>
I feel the gales, that from ye <mark3>blow,</mark3><br>
A momentary bliss <mark3>bestow,</mark3><br>
As waving fresh their gladsome <mark4>wing,</mark4><br>
My weary soul they seem to soothe, <br>
And, redolent of joy and <mark1>youth,</mark1><br>
To breathe a second <mark3>spring.</mark3><br>
<br>
Say, Father Thames, for thou hast <mark4>seen</mark4><br>
Full many a sprightly <mark3>race</mark3><br>
Disporting on thy margent <mark3>green</mark3><br>
The paths of pleasure <mark3>trace,</mark3><br>
Who foremost now delight to <mark4>cleave</mark4><br>
With pliant arm thy glassy <mark4>wave?</mark4><br>
         The captive linnet which enthrall? <br>
What idle progeny <mark4>succeed</mark4><br>
To chase the rolling circle's <mark3>speed,</mark3><br>
         Or urge the flying ball? <br>
<br>
While some on earnest business <mark4>bent</mark4><br>
Their murm'ring labours <mark3>ply</mark3><br>
'Gainst graver hours, that bring <mark4>constraint</mark4><br>
         To sweeten liberty: <br>
Some bold adventurers <mark4>disdain</mark4><br>
The limits of their little <mark3>reign,</mark3><br>
         And unknown regions dare descry: <br>
Still as they run they look <mark4>behind,</mark4><br>
They hear a voice in ev'ry <mark3>wind,</mark3><br>
         And snatch a fearful joy. <br>
<br>
Gay hope is theirs by fancy <mark4>fed,</mark4><br>
         Less pleasing when possest; <br>
The tear forgot as soon as <mark3>shed,</mark3><br>
The sunshine of the <mark4>breast:</mark4><br>
Theirs buxom health of rosy <mark3>hue,</mark3><br>
Wild wit, invention <mark3>ever-new,</mark3><br>
And lively cheer of vigour <mark4>born;</mark4><br>
The thoughtless day, the easy <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
The spirits pure, the slumbers <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
That fly th' approach of <mark3>morn.</mark3><br>
<br>
Alas, regardless of their <mark4>doom,</mark4><br>
The little victims <mark3>play!</mark3><br>
No sense have they of ills to <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
Nor care beyond <mark3>to-day:</mark3><br>
Yet see how all around 'em <mark4>wait</mark4><br>
The ministers of human <mark3>fate,</mark3><br>
And black Misfortune's baleful <mark4>train!</mark4><br>
Ah, show them where in ambush <mark4>stand</mark4><br>
To seize their prey the murth'rous <mark3>band!</mark3><br>
Ah, tell them they are <mark4>men!</mark4><br>
<br>
These shall the fury Passions <mark3>tear,</mark3><br>
The vultures of the <mark4>mind</mark4><br>
Disdainful Anger, pallid <mark3>Fear,</mark3><br>
And Shame that skulks <mark1>behind;</mark1><br>
Or pining Love shall waste their <mark1>youth,</mark1><br>
Or Jealousy with rankling <mark3>tooth,</mark3><br>
That inly gnaws the secret <mark4>heart,</mark4><br>
And Envy wan, and faded <mark4>Care,</mark4><br>
Grim-visag'd comfortless <mark3>Despair,</mark3><br>
And Sorrow's piercing <mark3>dart.</mark3><br>
<br>
Ambition this shall tempt to <mark4>rise,</mark4><br>
Then whirl the wretch from <mark3>high,</mark3><br>
To bitter Scorn a <mark4>sacrifice,</mark4><br>
         And grinning Infamy. <br>
The stings of Falsehood those shall <mark3>try,</mark3><br>
And hard Unkindness' alter'd <mark3>eye,</mark3><br>
That mocks the tear it forc'd to <mark3>flow;</mark3><br>
And keen Remorse with blood defil'd, <br>
And moody Madness laughing <mark4>wild</mark4><br>
Amid severest <mark3>woe.</mark3><br>
<br>
Lo, in the vale of years <mark4>beneath</mark4><br>
A griesly troop are <mark1>seen,</mark1><br>
The painful family of <mark4>Death,</mark4><br>
More hideous than their <mark3>Queen:</mark3><br>
This racks the joints, this fires the <mark4>veins,</mark4><br>
That ev'ry labouring sinew <mark3>strains,</mark3><br>
Those in the deeper vitals <mark3>rage:</mark3><br>
Lo, Poverty, to fill the <mark1>band,</mark1><br>
That numbs the soul with icy <mark3>hand,</mark3><br>
And slow-consuming <mark3>Age.</mark3><br>
<br>
To each his suff'rings: all are <mark1>men,</mark1><br>
Condemn'd alike to <mark4>groan,</mark4><br>
The tender for another's <mark1>pain;</mark1><br>
Th' unfeeling for his <mark4>own.</mark4><br>
Yet ah! why should they know their <mark1>fate?</mark1><br>
Since sorrow never comes too <mark3>late,</mark3><br>
And happiness too swiftly <mark4>flies.</mark4><br>
Thought would destroy their <mark3>paradise.</mark3><br>
No more; where ignorance is <mark4>bliss,</mark4><br>
'Tis folly to be <mark3>wise.</mark3><br>
