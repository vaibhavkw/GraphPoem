Author : Matthew Arnold <br><br>

Hark! ah, the <mark4>nightingale--</mark4><br>
The <mark4>tawny-throated!</mark4><br>
Hark, from that moonlit cedar what a <mark4>burst!</mark4><br>
What triumph! hark!--what <mark3>pain!</mark3><br>
<br>
O wanderer from a Grecian shore, <br>
Still, after many <mark4>years</mark4>, in distant <mark4>lands,</mark4><br>
Still nourishing in thy bewilder'd <mark3>brain</mark3><br>
That wild, unquench'd, <mark4>deep-sunken</mark4>, old-world <mark1>pain--</mark1><br>
<br>
Say, will it never <mark4>heal?</mark4><br>
And can this fragrant <mark4>lawn</mark4><br>
With its cool trees, and <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
And the sweet, tranquil <mark4>Thames,</mark4><br>
And moonshine, and the dew, <br>
To thy rack'd heart and <mark1>brain</mark1><br>
Afford no <mark4>balm?</mark4><br>
<br>
Dost thou to-night <mark4>behold,</mark4><br>
Here, through the moonlight on this English grass, <br>
The unfriendly palace in the Thracian <mark4>wild?</mark4><br>
Dost thou again <mark4>peruse</mark4><br>
With hot cheeks and sear'd <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
The too clear web, and thy dumb sister's <mark4>shame?</mark4><br>
Dost thou once more <mark4>assay</mark4><br>
Thy flight, and feel come over thee, <br>
Poor fugitive, the feathery change <br>
Once more, and once more seem to make <mark4>resound</mark4><br>
With love and hate, triumph and <mark4>agony,</mark4><br>
Lone Daulis, and the high Cephissian <mark4>vale?</mark4><br>
Listen, Eugenia-- <br>
How thick the bursts come crowding through the <mark4>leaves!</mark4><br>
Again--thou <mark5>hearest?</mark5><br>
Eternal <mark4>passion!</mark4><br>
Eternal <mark1>pain!</mark1><br>
