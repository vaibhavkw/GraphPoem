Title : The World Below the Brine <br>
Author : Walt Whitman <br><br>

The world below the brine, <br>
Forests at the bottom of the sea, the branches and <mark4>leaves,</mark4><br>
Sea-lettuce, vast lichens, strange flowers and seeds, the thick tangle, openings, and pink turf, <br>
Different colors, pale gray and green, purple, white, and gold, the play of light through the water, <br>
Dumb swimmers there among the rocks, coral, gluten, grass, <mark4>rushes</mark4>, and the aliment of the <mark4>swimmers,</mark4><br>
Sluggish existences grazing there suspended, or slowly crawling close to the bottom, <br>
The sperm-whale at the surface blowing air and spray, or disporting with his flukes, <br>
The leaden-eyed shark, the walrus, the turtle, the hairy sea-leopard, and the sting-ray, <br>
Passions there, wars, pursuits, tribes, sight in those ocean-depths, breathing that thick-breathing air, as so many do, <br>
The change thence to the sight <mark4>here</mark4>, and to the subtle air breathed by beings like us who walk this <mark4>sphere,</mark4><br>
The change onward from ours to that of beings who walk other <mark4>spheres.</mark4><br>
