Title : Sonnets from the Portuguese 1: I thought once how Theocritus had sung <br>
Author : Elizabeth Barrett Browning <br><br>

I thought once how Theocritus had <mark3>sung</mark3><br>
Of the sweet <mark1>years</mark1>, the dear and wished for <mark1>years,</mark1><br>
Who each one in a gracious hand <mark3>appears</mark3><br>
To bear a gift for mortals, old or <mark3>young:</mark3><br>
And, as I mused it in his antique <mark3>tongue,</mark3><br>
I saw, in gradual vision through my <mark3>tears,</mark3><br>
The sweet, sad <mark1>years</mark1>, the melancholy <mark1>years,</mark1><br>
Those of my own life, who by turns had <mark3>flung</mark3><br>
A shadow across me. Straightway I was 'ware, <br>
So weeping, how a mystic Shape did <mark4>move</mark4><br>
Behind me, and drew me backward by the <mark3>hair,</mark3><br>
And a voice said in mastery, while I strove, <mark4>...</mark4><br>
Guess now who holds thee?'--Death,' I said. But <mark3>there,</mark3><br>
The silver answer rang ... Not Death, but <mark4>Love.'</mark4><br>
