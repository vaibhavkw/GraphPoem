Title : Imps <br>
Author : Albert Goldbarth <br><br>

Fire isn't allowed, for the sake of the <mark4>books.</mark4><br>
The lean monk-copyist who scribes the books is slate-blue at his <mark4>fingertips</mark4><br>
this steely late-November day in the year 1000. Brother <mark1>Ambrosio</mark1><br>
huffs some perfunctory warmth on his stiffening <mark4>hands,</mark4><br>
then bends again to his goat's-horn of ink. For every <mark4>line,</mark4><br>
he believes, he's forgiven a sin. And now he's at his <mark4>heavy</mark4><br>
uncial letters, and will be for nine hours <mark3>more,</mark3><br>
until a slab of bread and a beet relieve his transcriptual <mark4>ardor.</mark4><br>
What he copies?--psalter, missal, <mark4>hagiography:</mark4><br>
the predetermined and sanctioned community <mark4>passions</mark4><br>
of a religious culture. Nothing like the twentieth <mark4>century's</mark4><br>
prevalent kneejerk "self-expression." Nothing like the <mark4>priest,</mark4><br>
<br>
excuse me: former priest, and former <mark4>nun</mark4>, on daytime talk <mark4>TV,</mark4><br>
who live, she tells us, in a "trinity of love" with the <mark4>former</mark4><br>
creator-of-tourist-ashtrays-out-of-catfish-heads. This <mark4>is,</mark4><br>
she insists, the final and jubilant stage of a lifelong <mark4>"quest</mark4><br>
to feel belongingness" initiated thirty years <mark3>before</mark3><br>
by parents skittering cross-country with the military: <mark3>they</mark3><br>
were wholly rootless, and so she grew up "unable to commit." The following <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
a man confesses to pedophilia because of a lesbian <mark4>aunt.</mark4><br>
A woman says she robbed the Sack-N-Save of $13.42 <br>
"because of what they're dumping in the water supply, it makes <mark3>me</mark3><br>
go all freaky." Steve was bounced out from The Chicken Shack <br>
"because I'm Scandinavian." The <mark4>culture</mark4><br>
<br>
of blame is so completely exterior in its search for <mark4>cause,</mark4><br>
some days I wake to think I'll find most people <mark4>laboring</mark4><br>
under the weight of sci-fi-style mind parasites, like fleshy <mark4>turbans</mark4><br>
spewing in, and feeding off, their brain blood. This (by <mark4>"this"</mark4><br>
I mean of course a recognition of the magic of objective correlative <br>
boppin' about in the spotlight) is, to some length, <br>
understandable: you can't beat the miniscule <mark4>carry-along</mark4><br>
convenience of a silicon chip invisibly set in <mark4>something,</mark4><br>
BUT for sheer persuasive visual power, that can't <mark3>touch</mark3><br>
a 1940s generating plant, its giant Alcatrazian shape <br>
against the sky, and the enormous wrestling electrical <mark4>crackles</mark4><br>
snaking its rooftop pylon. In the scriptorium, <mark4>even</mark4><br>
<br>
--such an isolated unit of human endeavor, its limited range <br>
of reactions surely is pure--when Brother <mark1>Ambrosio</mark1><br>
nods off, sleepy in his long day's long eighth <mark4>hour</mark4><br>
of thickly nibbed and careful <mark4>letters</mark4>, he <mark4>knows</mark4><br>
it's imps in league with Satan that keep pulling down his <mark4>eyelids.</mark4><br>
If in scratching his flea-measled thigh he <mark4>spills</mark4><br>
a hand's-expanse of ink across the vellum page, the <mark4>fleas</mark4><br>
are tiny devils on a guerilla mission from Hell. <br>
And once a devilkin took lodging in his belly, and <mark4>there</mark4><br>
created "rumbling noises like a toad, and which, for <mark4>hours,</mark4><br>
spoiled the concentration of all of the other <mark4>Brothers."</mark4><br>
We find parchment scraps with appropriate <mark4>exorcisms:</mark4><br>
<br>
"Away! you flaming sow, you poisoned udder,<br>
you arse of the arch-fiend, shit-fly, stinking <mark4>he-goat,</mark4><br>
out out out, away, back into thine infernal <mark4>kitchen,</mark4><br>
you bestial puke!" We also <mark5>find</mark5><br>
those charming marginal doodles (sprigs in <mark3>flower,</mark3><br>
unicorns, seemingly every songbird in Creation): <mark3>such</mark3><br>
diminutive external bodies given to the longings of <mark4>these</mark4><br>
cooped-up men. And when they came to drag my friend <mark4>Jess</mark4><br>
screaming to the <mark4>ward</mark4>, because he was beating his <mark4>head</mark4><br>
on the lawyer's steps, it was clear to us all that the <mark4>chemicals</mark4><br>
in his mind had turned against him. It was clear to <mark1>Jess</mark1><br>
that he was being hunted like prey by hounds from the <mark4>moon.</mark4><br>
