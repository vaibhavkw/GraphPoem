Title : Paradise Regain'd: Book 3 (1671 version) <br>
Author : John Milton <br><br>

SO spake the Son of <mark4>God</mark4>, and Satan <mark4>stood</mark4><br>
A while as mute confounded what to <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
What to reply, confuted and <mark5>convinc't</mark5><br>
Of his weak arguing, and fallacious <mark4>drift;</mark4><br>
At length collecting all his Serpent <mark4>wiles,</mark4><br>
With soothing words renew'd, him thus accosts. <br>
I see thou know'st what is of use to <mark5>know,</mark5><br>
What best to say canst say, to do canst <mark3>do;</mark3><br>
Thy actions to thy words accord, thy <mark4>words</mark4><br>
To thy large heart give utterance due, thy <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
Conteins of good, wise, just, the perfect <mark5>shape.</mark5><br>
Should Kings and Nations from thy mouth <mark4>consult,</mark4><br>
Thy Counsel would be as the <mark4>Oracle</mark4><br>
Urim and Thummim, those oraculous <mark4>gems</mark4><br>
On Aaron's breast: or tongue of Seers <mark4>old</mark4><br>
Infallible; or wert thou sought to <mark4>deeds</mark4><br>
That might require th' array of war, thy <mark4>skill</mark4><br>
Of conduct would be such, that all the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
Could not sustain thy Prowess, or <mark4>subsist</mark4><br>
In battel, though against thy few in <mark4>arms.</mark4><br>
These God-like Vertues wherefore dost thou <mark4>hide?</mark4><br>
Affecting private life, or more <mark3>obscure</mark3><br>
In savage Wilderness, wherefore <mark4>deprive</mark4><br>
All Earth her wonder at thy acts, thy <mark3>self</mark3><br>
The fame and glory, glory the <mark4>reward</mark4><br>
That sole excites to high attempts the <mark3>flame</mark3><br>
Of most erected Spirits, most temper'd <mark3>pure</mark3><br>
AEtherial, who all pleasures else <mark4>despise,</mark4><br>
All treasures and all gain esteem as <mark4>dross,</mark4><br>
And dignities and powers all but the <mark4>highest?</mark4><br>
Thy years are ripe, and over-ripe, the <mark4>Son</mark4><br>
Of Macedonian Philip had e're <mark4>these</mark4><br>
Won Asia and the Throne of Cyrus <mark4>held</mark4><br>
At his dispose, young Scipio had brought <mark4>down</mark4><br>
The Carthaginian pride, young Pompey <mark4>quell'd</mark4><br>
The Pontic King and in triumph had <mark4>rode.</mark4><br>
Yet years, and to ripe years judgment <mark3>mature,</mark3><br>
Quench not the thirst of glory, but <mark4>augment.</mark4><br>
Great Julius, whom now all the world <mark4>admires</mark4><br>
The more he grew in years, the more <mark5>inflam'd</mark5><br>
With glory, wept that he had liv'd so <mark4>long</mark4><br>
Inglorious: but thou yet art not too <mark4>late.</mark4><br>
To whom our Saviour calmly thus <mark4>reply'd.</mark4><br>
Thou neither dost perswade me to seek <mark4>wealth</mark4><br>
For Empires sake, nor Empire to <mark4>affect</mark4><br>
For glories sake by all thy <mark4>argument.</mark4><br>
For what is glory but the blaze of <mark3>fame,</mark3><br>
The peoples praise, if always praise <mark5>unmixt?</mark5><br>
And what the people but a herd <mark5>confus'd,</mark5><br>
A miscellaneous <mark4>rabble</mark4>, who <mark4>extol</mark4><br>
Things vulgar, & well <mark3>weigh'd</mark3>, scarce worth the <mark4>praise,</mark4><br>
They praise and they admire they know not <mark4>what;</mark4><br>
And know not whom, but as one leads the <mark4>other;</mark4><br>
And what delight to be by such <mark5>extoll'd,</mark5><br>
To live upon thir tongues and be thir <mark4>talk,</mark4><br>
Of whom to be disprais'd were no small <mark1>praise?</mark1><br>
His lot who dares be singularly <mark4>good.</mark4><br>
Th' intelligent among them and the <mark4>wise</mark4><br>
Are few, and glory scarce of few is <mark4>rais'd.</mark4><br>
This is true glory and renown, when <mark4>God</mark4><br>
Looking on the Earth, with approbation <mark4>marks</mark4><br>
The just <mark4>man</mark4>, and divulges him through <mark4>Heaven</mark4><br>
To all his <mark4>Angels</mark4>, who with true <mark4>applause</mark4><br>
Recount his praises; thus he did to <mark1>Job,</mark1><br>
When to extend his fame through Heaven & <mark4>Earth,</mark4><br>
As thou to thy reproach mayst well <mark4>remember,</mark4><br>
He ask'd thee, hast thou seen my servant <mark1>Job?</mark1><br>
Famous he was in <mark4>Heaven</mark4>, on Earth less <mark4>known;</mark4><br>
Where glory is false glory, <mark4>attributed</mark4><br>
To things not glorious, men not worthy of <mark1>fame.</mark1><br>
They err who count it glorious to <mark3>subdue</mark3><br>
By Conquest far and wide, to <mark4>over-run</mark4><br>
Large Countries, and in field great Battels <mark4>win,</mark4><br>
Great Cities by assault: what do these <mark4>Worthies,</mark4><br>
But rob and spoil, burn, slaughter, and <mark4>enslave</mark4><br>
Peaceable Nations, neighbouring, or <mark4>remote,</mark4><br>
Made Captive, yet deserving freedom <mark4>more</mark4><br>
Then those thir Conquerours, who leave <mark4>behind</mark4><br>
Nothing but ruin wheresoe're they <mark4>rove,</mark4><br>
And all the flourishing works of peace <mark5>destroy,</mark5><br>
Then swell with pride, and must be titl'd <mark4>Gods,</mark4><br>
Great Benefactors of mankind, <mark4>Deliverers,</mark4><br>
Worship't with Temple, Priest and <mark4>Sacrifice;</mark4><br>
One is the Son of Jove, of Mars the <mark1>other,</mark1><br>
Till Conquerour Death discover them scarce <mark4>men,</mark4><br>
Rowling in brutish <mark4>vices</mark4>, and <mark4>deform'd,</mark4><br>
Violent or shameful death thir due <mark1>reward.</mark1><br>
But if there be in glory aught of <mark1>good,</mark1><br>
It may by means far different be <mark4>attain'd</mark4><br>
Without ambition, war, or <mark4>violence;</mark4><br>
By deeds of peace, by wisdom <mark4>eminent,</mark4><br>
By patience, temperance; I mention <mark4>still</mark4><br>
Him whom thy wrongs with Saintly patience <mark4>born,</mark4><br>
Made famous in a Land and times <mark1>obscure;</mark1><br>
Who names not now with honour patient <mark1>Job?</mark1><br>
Poor Socrates (who next more <mark4>memorable?)</mark4><br>
By what he taught and suffer'd for so <mark4>doing,</mark4><br>
For truths sake suffering death unjust, lives <mark3>now</mark3><br>
Equal in fame to proudest Conquerours. <br>
Yet if for fame and glory aught be <mark4>done,</mark4><br>
Aught suffer'd; if young African for <mark1>fame</mark1><br>
His wasted Country freed from Punic <mark4>rage,</mark4><br>
The deed becomes unprais'd, the man at <mark4>least,</mark4><br>
And loses, though but verbal, his <mark1>reward.</mark1><br>
Shall I seek glory then, as vain men <mark4>seek</mark4><br>
Oft not deserv'd?   I seek not mine, but <mark4>his</mark4><br>
Who sent me, and thereby witness whence I <mark4>am.</mark4><br>
To whom the Tempter murmuring thus <mark1>reply'd.</mark1><br>
Think not so slight of glory; therein <mark1>least</mark1><br>
Resembling thy great Father: he seeks <mark1>glory,</mark1><br>
And for his glory all things made, all <mark4>things</mark4><br>
Orders and governs, nor content in <mark1>Heaven</mark1><br>
By all his Angels glorifi'd, <mark4>requires</mark4><br>
Glory from men, from all men good or <mark4>bad,</mark4><br>
Wise or unwise, no difference, no <mark4>exemption;</mark4><br>
Above all Sacrifice, or hallow'd <mark4>gift</mark4><br>
Glory he <mark4>requires</mark4>, and glory he <mark4>receives</mark4><br>
Promiscuous from all Nations, Jew, or <mark3>Greek,</mark3><br>
Or Barbarous, nor exception hath <mark5>declar'd;</mark5><br>
From us his foes pronounc't glory he <mark4>exacts.</mark4><br>
To whom our Saviour fervently <mark1>reply'd.</mark1><br>
And reason; since his word all things <mark4>produc'd,</mark4><br>
Though chiefly not for glory as prime <mark4>end,</mark4><br>
But to shew forth his goodness, and <mark4>impart</mark4><br>
His good communicable to every <mark4>soul</mark4><br>
Freely; of whom what could he less <mark4>expect</mark4><br>
Then glory and benediction, that is <mark4>thanks,</mark4><br>
The slightest, easiest, readiest <mark5>recompence</mark5><br>
From them who could return him nothing <mark4>else,</mark4><br>
And not returning that would likeliest <mark4>render</mark4><br>
Contempt instead, dishonour, obloquy? <br>
Hard recompence, unsutable <mark4>return</mark4><br>
For so much good, so much <mark4>beneficence.</mark4><br>
But why should man seek glory? who of his <mark4>own</mark4><br>
Hath nothing, and to whom nothing <mark4>belongs</mark4><br>
But condemnation, ignominy, and <mark4>shame?</mark4><br>
Who for so many benefits <mark5>receiv'd</mark5><br>
Turn'd recreant to God, ingrate and <mark4>false,</mark4><br>
And so of all true good himself <mark5>despoil'd,</mark5><br>
Yet, sacrilegious, to himself would <mark4>take</mark4><br>
That which to God alone of right <mark1>belongs;</mark1><br>
Yet so much bounty is in God, such <mark4>grace,</mark4><br>
That who advance his glory, not thir <mark1>own,</mark1><br>
Them he himself to glory will <mark4>advance.</mark4><br>
So spake the Son of God; and here <mark4>again</mark4><br>
Satan had not to answer, but stood <mark4>struck</mark4><br>
With guilt of his own sin, for he <mark3>himself</mark3><br>
Insatiable of glory had lost <mark4>all,</mark4><br>
Yet of another Plea bethought him <mark4>soon.</mark4><br>
Of glory as thou wilt, said he, so <mark4>deem,</mark4><br>
Worth or not worth the seeking, let it <mark4>pass:</mark4><br>
But to a Kingdom thou art born, <mark4>ordain'd</mark4><br>
To sit upon thy Father David's <mark4>Throne;</mark4><br>
By Mothers side thy Father, though thy <mark4>right</mark4><br>
Be now in powerful hands, that will not <mark4>part</mark4><br>
Easily from possession won with <mark1>arms;</mark1><br>
Judaea now and all the promis'd <mark4>land</mark4><br>
Reduc't a Province under Roman <mark4>yoke,</mark4><br>
Obeys Tiberius; nor is always rul'd <br>
With temperate sway; oft have they <mark4>violated</mark4><br>
The Temple, oft the Law with foul <mark4>affronts,</mark4><br>
Abominations rather, as did <mark4>once</mark4><br>
Antiochus: and think'st thou to <mark4>regain</mark4><br>
Thy right by sitting still or thus <mark4>retiring?</mark4><br>
So did not Machabeus: he <mark4>indeed</mark4><br>
Retir'd unto the Desert, but with <mark1>arms;</mark1><br>
And o're a mighty King so oft <mark4>prevail'd,</mark4><br>
That by strong hand his Family <mark4>obtain'd,</mark4><br>
Though Priests, the Crown, and David's Throne <mark4>usurp'd,</mark4><br>
With Modin and her Suburbs once <mark4>content.</mark4><br>
If Kingdom move thee not, let move thee <mark4>Zeal,</mark4><br>
And Duty; Zeal and Duty are not <mark3>slow;</mark3><br>
But on Occasions forelock watchful <mark4>wait.</mark4><br>
They themselves rather are occasion <mark4>best,</mark4><br>
Zeal of thy Fathers house, Duty to <mark3>free</mark3><br>
Thy Country from her Heathen <mark4>servitude;</mark4><br>
So shalt thou best fullfil, best verifie <br>
The Prophets old, who sung thy endless <mark5>raign,</mark5><br>
The happier raign the sooner it <mark4>begins,</mark4><br>
Raign then; what canst thou better do the <mark4>while?</mark4><br>
To whom our Saviour answer thus <mark4>return'd.</mark4><br>
All things are best fullfil'd in their due <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
And time there is for all things, Truth hath <mark4>said:</mark4><br>
If of my raign Prophetic Writ hath <mark4>told,</mark4><br>
That it shall never end, so when <mark4>begin</mark4><br>
The Father in his purpose hath <mark4>decreed,</mark4><br>
He in whose hand all times and seasons <mark5>roul.</mark5><br>
What if he hath decreed that I shall <mark4>first</mark4><br>
Be try'd in humble state, and things <mark4>adverse,</mark4><br>
By tribulations, injuries, <mark4>insults,</mark4><br>
Contempts, and scorns, and snares, and <mark1>violence,</mark1><br>
Suffering, <mark4>abstaining</mark4>, quietly <mark4>expecting</mark4><br>
Without distrust or doubt, that he may <mark1>know</mark1><br>
What I can suffer, how obey? who <mark1>best</mark1><br>
Can suffer, best can do; best reign, who <mark1>first</mark1><br>
Well hath obey'd; just tryal e're I <mark4>merit</mark4><br>
My exaltation without change or <mark1>end.</mark1><br>
But what concerns it thee when I <mark1>begin</mark1><br>
My everlasting Kingdom, why art <mark3>thou</mark3><br>
Sollicitous, what moves thy <mark4>inquisition?</mark4><br>
Know'st thou not that my rising is thy <mark4>fall,</mark4><br>
And my promotion will be thy <mark4>destruction?</mark4><br>
To whom the Tempter inly rackt <mark1>reply'd.</mark1><br>
Let that come when it comes; all hope is <mark4>lost</mark4><br>
Of my reception into <mark4>grace</mark4>, what <mark4>worse?</mark4><br>
For where no hope is left, is left no <mark4>fear;</mark4><br>
If there be worse, the expectation <mark1>more</mark1><br>
Of worse torments me then the feeling <mark4>can.</mark4><br>
I would be at the <mark4>worst</mark4>, worst is my <mark4>Port,</mark4><br>
My harbour and my ultimate <mark4>repose,</mark4><br>
The end I would attain, my final <mark1>good.</mark1><br>
My error was my error and my <mark3>crime</mark3><br>
My crime; whatever for it self <mark4>condemn'd,</mark4><br>
And will alike be punish'd; whether <mark1>thou</mark1><br>
Raign or raign not; though to that gentle <mark3>brow</mark3><br>
Willingly I could flye, and hope thy <mark1>raign,</mark1><br>
From that placid aspect and meek <mark4>regard,</mark4><br>
Rather then aggravate my evil <mark4>state,</mark4><br>
Would stand between me and thy Fathers <mark4>ire,</mark4><br>
(Whose ire I dread more then the fire of <mark4>Hell)</mark4><br>
A shelter and a kind of shading <mark4>cool</mark4><br>
Interposition, as a summers <mark4>cloud.</mark4><br>
If I then to the worst that can be <mark4>hast,</mark4><br>
Why move thy feet so slow to what is <mark1>best,</mark1><br>
Happiest both to thy self and all the <mark1>world,</mark1><br>
That thou who worthiest art should'st be thir <mark4>King?</mark4><br>
Perhaps thou linger'st in deep thoughts <mark4>detain'd</mark4><br>
Of the enterprize so hazardous and <mark5>high;</mark5><br>
No wonder, for though in thee be <mark4>united</mark4><br>
What of perfection can in man be <mark4>found,</mark4><br>
Or human nature can receive, <mark4>consider</mark4><br>
Thy life hath yet been <mark4>private</mark4>, most part <mark4>spent</mark4><br>
At home, scarce view'd the Gallilean <mark4>Towns,</mark4><br>
And once a year Jerusalem, few <mark4>days</mark4><br>
Short sojourn; and what thence could'st thou <mark4>observe?</mark4><br>
The world thou hast not seen, much less her <mark1>glory,</mark1><br>
Empires, and <mark4>Monarchs</mark4>, and thir radiant <mark4>Courts,</mark4><br>
Best school of best experience, quickest in <mark4>sight</mark4><br>
In all things that to greatest actions <mark4>lead.</mark4><br>
The wisest, unexperienc't, will be <mark4>ever</mark4><br>
Timorous and loth, with novice <mark4>modesty,</mark4><br>
(As he who seeking Asses found a <mark4>Kingdom)</mark4><br>
Irresolute, unhardy, unadventrous: <br>
But I will bring thee where thou soon shalt <mark4>quit</mark4><br>
Those rudiments, and see before thine <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
The Monarchies of the Earth, thir pomp and <mark1>state,</mark1><br>
Sufficient introduction to <mark4>inform</mark4><br>
Thee, of thy self so apt, in regal <mark4>Arts,</mark4><br>
And regal Mysteries; that thou may'st <mark1>know</mark1><br>
How best their opposition to <mark4>withstand.</mark4><br>
With that (such power was giv'n him then) he <mark4>took</mark4><br>
The Son of God up to a Mountain <mark1>high.</mark1><br>
It was a Mountain at whose verdant <mark4>feet</mark4><br>
A spatious plain out stretch't in circuit <mark4>wide</mark4><br>
Lay pleasant; from his side two rivers <mark4>flow'd,</mark4><br>
Th' one winding, the other strait and left <mark4>between</mark4><br>
Fair Champain with less rivers interveind, <br>
Then meeting joyn'd thir tribute to the <mark3>Sea:</mark3><br>
Fertil of corn the glebe, of oyl and <mark4>wine,</mark4><br>
With herds the pastures <mark4>throng'd</mark4>, with flocks the <mark4>hills,</mark4><br>
Huge Cities and high towr'd, that well might <mark4>seem</mark4><br>
The seats of mightiest Monarchs, and so <mark4>large</mark4><br>
The Prospect was, that here and there was <mark4>room</mark4><br>
For barren desert fountainless and <mark3>dry.</mark3><br>
To this high mountain top the Tempter <mark4>brought</mark4><br>
Our Saviour, and new train of words <mark4>began.</mark4><br>
Well have we speeded, and o're hill and <mark4>dale,</mark4><br>
Forest and field, and flood, Temples and <mark4>Towers</mark4><br>
Cut shorter many a league; here thou <mark4>behold'st</mark4><br>
Assyria and her Empires antient <mark4>bounds,</mark4><br>
Araxes and the Caspian lake, thence <mark4>on</mark4><br>
As far as Indus <mark4>East</mark4>, Euphrates <mark4>West,</mark4><br>
And oft beyond; to South the Persian <mark3>Bay,</mark3><br>
And inaccessible the Arabian <mark5>drouth:</mark5><br>
Here Ninevee, of length within her <mark4>wall</mark4><br>
Several days journey, built by Ninus <mark1>old,</mark1><br>
Of that first golden Monarchy the <mark4>seat,</mark4><br>
And seat of Salmanassar, whose <mark4>success</mark4><br>
Israel in long captivity still <mark4>mourns;</mark4><br>
There Babylon the wonder of all <mark4>tongues,</mark4><br>
As antient, but rebuilt by him who <mark4>twice</mark4><br>
Judah and all thy Father David's <mark4>house</mark4><br>
Led captive, and Jerusalem laid <mark4>waste,</mark4><br>
Till Cyrus set them free; <mark4>Persepolis</mark4><br>
His City there thou seest, and Bactra <mark4>there;</mark4><br>
Ecbatana her structure vast there <mark5>shews,</mark5><br>
And Hecatompylos her hunderd <mark4>gates,</mark4><br>
There Susa by Choaspes, amber <mark4>stream,</mark4><br>
The drink of none but Kings; of later <mark1>fame</mark1><br>
Built by Emathian, or by Parthian <mark4>hands,</mark4><br>
The great Seleucia, Nisibis, and <mark1>there</mark1><br>
Artaxata, Teredon, Tesiphon, <br>
Turning with easie eye thou may'st <mark3>behold.</mark3><br>
All these the Parthian, now some Ages <mark4>past,</mark4><br>
By great Arsaces led, who founded <mark1>first</mark1><br>
That Empire, under his dominion <mark4>holds</mark4><br>
From the luxurious Kings of Antioch <mark3>won.</mark3><br>
And just in time thou com'st to have a <mark3>view</mark3><br>
Of his great power; for now the Parthian <mark1>King</mark1><br>
In Ctesiphon hath gather'd all his <mark4>Host</mark4><br>
Against the Scythian, whose incursions <mark4>wild</mark4><br>
Have wasted Sogdiana; to her <mark4>aid</mark4><br>
He marches now in hast; see, though from <mark4>far,</mark4><br>
His thousands, in what martial equipage <br>
They issue forth, Steel <mark4>Bows</mark4>, and Shafts their <mark1>arms</mark1><br>
Of equal dread in <mark4>flight</mark4>, or in <mark4>pursuit;</mark4><br>
All Horsemen, in which fight they most <mark4>excel;</mark4><br>
See how in warlike muster they <mark4>appear,</mark4><br>
In Rhombs and wedges, and half <mark4>moons</mark4>, and <mark4>wings.</mark4><br>
   He look't and saw what numbers numberless <br>
The City gates out powr'd, light armed <mark4>Troops</mark4><br>
In coats of Mail and military <mark4>pride;</mark4><br>
In Mail thir horses clad, yet fleet and <mark4>strong,</mark4><br>
Prauncing their riders bore, the flower and <mark4>choice</mark4><br>
Of many Provinces from bound to <mark4>bound;</mark4><br>
From Arachosia, from Candaor <mark4>East,</mark4><br>
And Margiana to the Hyrcanian <mark4>cliffs</mark4><br>
Of Caucasus, and dark Iberian <mark4>dales,</mark4><br>
From Atropatia and the neighbouring <mark4>plains</mark4><br>
Of Adiabene, Media, and the <mark4>South</mark4><br>
Of Susiana to Balsara's hav'n. <br>
He saw them in thir forms of battell <mark4>rang'd,</mark4><br>
How quick they wheel'd, and flying behind them <mark4>shot</mark4><br>
Sharp sleet of arrowie showers against the <mark4>face</mark4><br>
Of thir pursuers, and overcame by <mark4>flight;</mark4><br>
The field all iron cast a gleaming <mark4>brown,</mark4><br>
Nor wanted clouds of foot, nor on each <mark4>horn,</mark4><br>
Cuirassiers all in steel for standing <mark3>fight;</mark3><br>
Chariots or Elephants endorst with <mark1>Towers</mark1><br>
Of Archers, nor of labouring Pioners <br>
A multitude with Spades and Axes <mark4>arm'd</mark4><br>
To lay hills plain, fell woods, or valleys <mark4>fill,</mark4><br>
Or where plain was raise hill, or <mark5>over-lay</mark5><br>
With bridges rivers proud, as with a <mark1>yoke;</mark1><br>
Mules after these, Camels and Dromedaries, <br>
And Waggons fraught with Utensils of <mark4>war.</mark4><br>
Such forces met not, nor so wide a <mark4>camp,</mark4><br>
When Agrican with all his Northern <mark4>powers</mark4><br>
Besieg'd Albracca, as Romances <mark4>tell;</mark4><br>
The City of Gallaphrone, from thence to <mark1>win</mark1><br>
The fairest of her Sex Angelica <br>
His daughter, sought by many Prowest <mark4>Knights,</mark4><br>
Both Paynim, and the Peers of Charlemane. <br>
Such and so numerous was thir Chivalrie; <br>
At sight whereof the Fiend yet more <mark5>presum'd,</mark5><br>
And to our Saviour thus his words <mark4>renew'd.</mark4><br>
That thou may'st know I seek not to <mark4>engage</mark4><br>
Thy Vertue, and not every way <mark4>secure</mark4><br>
On no slight grounds thy safety; hear, and <mark4>mark</mark4><br>
To what end I have brought thee hither and <mark5>shewn</mark5><br>
All this fair sight; thy Kingdom though <mark4>foretold</mark4><br>
By Prophet or by Angel, unless <mark1>thou</mark1><br>
Endeavour, as thy Father David <mark4>did,</mark4><br>
Thou never shalt obtain; prediction <mark1>still</mark1><br>
In all things, and all men, supposes <mark4>means,</mark4><br>
Without means us'd, what it predicts revokes. <br>
But say thou wer't possess'd of David's <mark1>Throne</mark1><br>
By free consent of all, none <mark4>opposite,</mark4><br>
Samaritan or Jew; how could'st thou <mark4>hope</mark4><br>
Long to enjoy it quiet and <mark1>secure,</mark1><br>
Between two such enclosing <mark4>enemies</mark4><br>
Roman and Parthian? therefore one of <mark1>these</mark1><br>
Thou must make sure thy own, the Parthian <mark1>first</mark1><br>
By my advice, as nearer and of <mark1>late</mark1><br>
Found able by invasion to <mark3>annoy</mark3><br>
Thy country, and captive lead away her <mark4>Kings</mark4><br>
Antigonus, and old Hyrcanus <mark1>bound,</mark1><br>
Maugre the Roman: it shall be my <mark4>task</mark4><br>
To render thee the Parthian at <mark4>dispose;</mark4><br>
Chuse which thou wilt by conquest or by <mark5>league.</mark5><br>
By him thou shalt regain, without him <mark4>not,</mark4><br>
That which alone can truly reinstall <mark3>thee</mark3><br>
In David's royal seat, his true Successour, <br>
Deliverance of thy brethren, those ten <mark4>Tribes</mark4><br>
Whose off-spring in his Territory yet <mark3>serve</mark3><br>
In Habor, and among the Medes <mark5>dispers't,</mark5><br>
Ten Sons of Jacob, two of Joseph <mark1>lost</mark1><br>
Thus long from Israel; serving as of <mark1>old</mark1><br>
Thir Fathers in the land of Egypt <mark4>serv'd,</mark4><br>
This offer sets before thee to <mark4>deliver.</mark4><br>
These if from servitude thou shalt <mark4>restore</mark4><br>
To thir inheritance, <mark1>then</mark1>, nor till <mark4>then,</mark4><br>
Thou on the Throne of David in full <mark1>glory,</mark1><br>
From Egypt to Euphrates and <mark4>beyond</mark4><br>
Shalt raign, and Rome or Caesar not need <mark1>fear.</mark1><br>
To whom our Saviour answer'd thus <mark5>unmov'd.</mark5><br>
Much ostentation vain of fleshly <mark4>arm,</mark4><br>
And fragile arms, much instrument of <mark1>war</mark1><br>
Long in preparing, soon to nothing <mark1>brought,</mark1><br>
Before mine eyes thou hast set; and in my <mark4>ear</mark4><br>
Vented much policy, and projects <mark4>deep</mark4><br>
Of enemies, of <mark4>aids</mark4>, battels and <mark4>leagues,</mark4><br>
Plausible to the world, to me worth <mark3>naught.</mark3><br>
Means I must use thou say'st, prediction <mark1>else</mark1><br>
Will unpredict and fail me of the <mark1>Throne:</mark1><br>
My time I told <mark1>thee</mark1>, (and that time for <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
Were better farthest off) is not yet <mark4>come,;</mark4><br>
When that comes think not thou to find me <mark4>slack</mark4><br>
On my part aught endeavouring, or to <mark4>need</mark4><br>
Thy politic maxims, or that <mark4>cumbersome</mark4><br>
Luggage of war there shewn me, <mark1>argument</mark1><br>
Of human weakness rather then of <mark4>strength.</mark4><br>
My brethren, as thou call'st them; those Ten <mark1>Tribes</mark1><br>
I must deliver, if I mean to <mark1>raign</mark1><br>
David's true heir, and his full Scepter <mark3>sway</mark3><br>
To just extent over all Israel's <mark4>Sons;</mark4><br>
But whence to thee this zeal, where was it <mark1>then</mark1><br>
For Israel, or for David, or his <mark1>Throne,</mark1><br>
When thou stood'st up his Tempter to the <mark1>pride</mark1><br>
Of numbring Israel, which cost the <mark4>lives</mark4><br>
Of threescore and ten thousand <mark4>Israelites</mark4><br>
By three days Pestilence? such was thy <mark1>zeal</mark1><br>
To Israel then, the same that now to <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
As for those captive Tribes, themselves were <mark3>they</mark3><br>
Who wrought their own captivity, fell <mark4>off</mark4><br>
From God to worship <mark4>Calves</mark4>, the <mark4>Deities</mark4><br>
Of Egypt, Baal next and Ashtaroth, <br>
And all the Idolatries of Heathen <mark4>round,</mark4><br>
Besides thir other worse then heathenish <mark4>crimes;</mark4><br>
Nor in the land of their <mark4>captivity</mark4><br>
Humbled themselves, or penitent <mark5>besought</mark5><br>
The God of their fore-fathers; but so dy'd <br>
Impenitent, and left a race <mark1>behind</mark1><br>
Like to themselves, distinguishable <mark4>scarce</mark4><br>
From Gentils, but by Circumcision <mark4>vain,</mark4><br>
And God with Idols in their worship joyn'd. <br>
Should I of these the liberty <mark1>regard,</mark1><br>
Who freed, as to their antient <mark4>Patrimony,</mark4><br>
Unhumbl'd, unrepentant, unreform'd, <br>
Headlong would follow; and to thir Gods <mark4>perhaps</mark4><br>
Of Bethel and of Dan? no, let them <mark1>serve</mark1><br>
Thir enemies, who serve Idols with <mark1>God.</mark1><br>
Yet he at length, time to himself best <mark1>known,</mark1><br>
Remembring Abraham by some wond'rous <mark4>call</mark4><br>
May bring them back repentant and <mark3>sincere,</mark3><br>
And at their passing cleave the Assyrian <mark4>flood,</mark4><br>
While to their native land with joy they <mark1>hast,</mark1><br>
As the Red Sea and Jordan once he <mark4>cleft,</mark4><br>
When to the promis'd land thir Fathers <mark4>pass'd;</mark4><br>
To his due time and providence I leave <mark4>them.</mark4><br>
So spake Israel's true King, and to the <mark4>Fiend</mark4><br>
Made answer meet, that made void all his <mark1>wiles.</mark1><br>
So fares it when with truth falshood <mark4>contends.</mark4><br>
