Title : from Idylls of the King: The Passing of Arthur <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

That story which the bold Sir <mark1>Bedivere,</mark1><br>
First made and latest left of all the <mark4>knights,</mark4><br>
Told, when the man was no more than a <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
In the white winter of his age, to <mark4>those</mark4><br>
With whom he dwelt, new <mark4>faces</mark4>, other <mark4>minds.</mark4><br>
<br>
For on their march to westward, <mark1>Bedivere,</mark1><br>
Who slowly paced among the slumbering <mark4>host,</mark4><br>
Heard in his tent the moanings of the <mark3>King:</mark3><br>
<br>
"I found Him in the shining of the <mark4>stars,</mark4><br>
I mark'd Him in the flowering of His <mark4>fields,</mark4><br>
But in His ways with men I find Him <mark4>not.</mark4><br>
I waged His wars, and now I pass and <mark1>die.</mark1><br>
O me! for why is all around us <mark4>here</mark4><br>
As if some lesser god had made the <mark4>world,</mark4><br>
But had not force to shape it as he <mark4>would,</mark4><br>
Till the High God behold it from <mark4>beyond,</mark4><br>
And enter it, and make it <mark4>beautiful?</mark4><br>
Or else as if the world were wholly <mark4>fair,</mark4><br>
But that these eyes of men are dense and <mark4>dim,</mark4><br>
And have not power to see it as it <mark4>is:</mark4><br>
<mark4>Perchance</mark4>, because we see not to the <mark4>close;--</mark4><br>
For I, being <mark4>simple</mark4>, thought to work His <mark4>will,</mark4><br>
And have but stricken with the sword in <mark4>vain;</mark4><br>
And all whereon I lean'd in wife and <mark4>friend</mark4><br>
Is traitor to my peace, and all my <mark4>realm</mark4><br>
Reels back into the beast, and is no <mark4>more.</mark4><br>
My God, thou hast forgotten me in my <mark1>death:</mark1><br>
Nay--God my Christ--I pass but shall not <mark1>die."</mark1><br>
<br>
Then, ere that last weird battle in the <mark4>west,</mark4><br>
There came on Arthur sleeping, Gawain <mark4>kill'd</mark4><br>
In Lancelot's war, the ghost of Gawain <mark4>blown</mark4><br>
Along a wandering wind, and past his <mark4>ear</mark4><br>
Went shrilling, "Hollow, hollow all <mark4>delight!</mark4><br>
Hail, King! to-morrow thou shalt pass <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
Farewell! there is an isle of rest for <mark3>thee.</mark3><br>
And I am blown along a wandering <mark4>wind,</mark4><br>
And hollow, hollow, hollow all <mark1>delight."</mark1><br>
And fainter onward, like wild birds that <mark4>change</mark4><br>
Their season in the night and wail their <mark3>way</mark3><br>
From cloud to cloud, down the long wind the <mark4>dream</mark4><br>
<mark4>Shrill'd</mark4>, but in going mingled with dim <mark4>cries</mark4><br>
Far in the moonlit haze among the <mark4>hills,</mark4><br>
As of some lonely city sack'd by <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
When all is lost, and wife and child with <mark4>wail</mark4><br>
Pass to new <mark4>lords</mark4>, and Arthur woke and <mark4>call'd,</mark4><br>
"Who spake? A dream. O light upon the <mark1>wind,</mark1><br>
Thine, Gawain, was the voice--are these dim <mark1>cries</mark1><br>
Thine? or doth all that haunts the waste and <mark4>wild</mark4><br>
Mourn, knowing it will go along with <mark3>me?"</mark3><br>
<br>
This heard the bold Sir Bedivere and <mark4>spake:</mark4><br>
"O me, my King, let pass whatever <mark1>will,</mark1><br>
Elves, and the harmless glamour of the <mark4>field;</mark4><br>
But in their stead thy name and glory <mark3>cling</mark3><br>
To all high places like a golden <mark4>cloud</mark4><br>
For ever: but as yet thou shalt not <mark4>pass.</mark4><br>
Light was Gawain in life, and light in <mark1>death</mark1><br>
Is <mark4>Gawain</mark4>, for the ghost is as the <mark4>man;</mark4><br>
And care not thou for dreams from him, but <mark3>rise--</mark3><br>
I hear the steps of Modred in the <mark1>west,</mark1><br>
And with him many of thy people, and <mark1>knights</mark1><br>
Once thine, whom thou hast loved, but grosser <mark4>grown</mark4><br>
Than heathen, spitting at their vows and <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
Right well in heart they know thee for the <mark1>King.</mark1><br>
Arise, go forth and conquer as of <mark4>old."</mark4><br>
<br>
Then spake King Arthur to Sir <mark1>Bedivere:</mark1><br>
"Far other is this battle in the <mark1>west</mark1><br>
Whereto we move, than when we strove in <mark4>youth,</mark4><br>
And brake the petty kings, and fought with <mark4>Rome,</mark4><br>
Or thrust the heathen from the Roman <mark4>wall,</mark4><br>
And shook him thro' the north. Ill doom is <mark4>mine</mark4><br>
To war against my people and my <mark1>knights.</mark1><br>
The king who fights his people fights <mark5>himself.</mark5><br>
And they my knights, who loved me once, the <mark4>stroke</mark4><br>
That strikes them dead is as my death to <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
Yet let us hence, and find or feel a <mark1>way</mark1><br>
Thro' this blind haze, which ever since I <mark1>saw</mark1><br>
One lying in the dust at Almesbury, <br>
Hath folded in the passes of the <mark1>world."</mark1><br>
<br>
Then rose the King and moved his host by <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
And ever push'd Sir Modred, league by league, <br>
Back to the sunset bound of Lyonnesse-- <br>
A land of old upheaven from the <mark4>abyss</mark4><br>
By fire, to sink into the abyss <mark4>again;</mark4><br>
Where fragments of forgotten peoples <mark4>dwelt,</mark4><br>
And the long mountains ended in a <mark4>coast</mark4><br>
Of ever-shifting sand, and far <mark1>away</mark1><br>
The phantom circle of a moaning <mark3>sea.</mark3><br>
There the pursuer could pursue no <mark1>more,</mark1><br>
And he that fled no further fly the <mark1>King;</mark1><br>
And there, that day when the great light of <mark4>heaven</mark4><br>
Burn'd at his lowest in the rolling <mark4>year,</mark4><br>
On the waste sand by the waste sea they <mark4>closed.</mark4><br>
Nor ever yet had Arthur fought a <mark4>fight</mark4><br>
Like this last, dim, weird battle of the <mark1>west.</mark1><br>
A deathwhite mist slept over sand and <mark1>sea:</mark1><br>
Whereof the chill, to him who breathed it, <mark5>drew</mark5><br>
Down with his <mark4>blood</mark4>, till all his heart was <mark4>cold</mark4><br>
With formless fear; and ev'n on Arthur <mark4>fell</mark4><br>
Confusion, since he saw not whom he <mark4>fought.</mark4><br>
<br>
For friend and foe were shadows in the <mark4>mist,</mark4><br>
And friend slew friend not knowing whom he <mark3>slew;</mark3><br>
And some had visions out of golden <mark1>youth,</mark1><br>
And some beheld the faces of old <mark4>ghosts</mark4><br>
Look in upon the battle; and in the <mark1>mist</mark1><br>
Was many a noble deed, many a <mark4>base,</mark4><br>
And chance and craft and strength in single <mark4>fights,</mark4><br>
And ever and anon with host to <mark1>host</mark1><br>
Shocks, and the splintering spear, the hard mail <mark4>hewn,</mark4><br>
Shield-breakings, and the clash of brands, the <mark5>crash</mark5><br>
Of battleaxes on shatter'd helms, and <mark4>shrieks</mark4><br>
After the Christ, of those who falling <mark4>down</mark4><br>
Look'd up for heaven, and only saw the <mark1>mist;</mark1><br>
And shouts of heathen and the traitor <mark1>knights,</mark1><br>
Oaths, insult, filth, and monstrous blasphemies, <br>
Sweat, writhings, anguish, labouring of the <mark4>lungs</mark4><br>
In that close <mark4>mist</mark4>, and cryings for the <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
Moans of the dying, and voices of the <mark4>dead.</mark4><br>
<br>
Last, as by some one deathbed after <mark1>wail</mark1><br>
Of suffering, silence follows, or thro' <mark1>death</mark1><br>
Or deathlike swoon, thus over all that <mark4>shore,</mark4><br>
Save for some whisper of the seething <mark4>seas,</mark4><br>
A dead hush fell; but when the dolorous <mark3>day</mark3><br>
Grew drearier toward twilight falling, <mark4>came</mark4><br>
A bitter wind, clear from the North, and <mark3>blew</mark3><br>
The mist <mark3>aside</mark3>, and with that wind the <mark4>tide</mark4><br>
Rose, and the pale King glanced across the <mark1>field</mark1><br>
Of battle: but no man was moving <mark4>there;</mark4><br>
Nor any cry of Christian heard <mark4>thereon,</mark4><br>
Nor yet of heathen; only the wan <mark4>wave</mark4><br>
Brake in among dead faces, to and <mark3>fro</mark3><br>
Swaying the helpless hands, and up and <mark1>down</mark1><br>
Tumbling the hollow helmets of the <mark4>fallen,</mark4><br>
And shiver'd brands that once had fought with <mark1>Rome,</mark1><br>
And rolling far along the gloomy <mark4>shores</mark4><br>
The voice of days of old and days to <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then spake King Arthur to Sir <mark1>Bedivere,</mark1><br>
And whiter than the mist that all day <mark4>long</mark4><br>
Had held the field of battle was the <mark1>King:</mark1><br>
<br>
"Hearest thou this great voice that shakes the <mark1>world,</mark1><br>
And wastes the narrow realm whereon we <mark4>move,</mark4><br>
And beats upon the faces of the <mark1>dead,</mark1><br>
My dead, as tho' they had not died for <mark1>me?--</mark1><br>
O Bedivere, for on my heart hath <mark4>fall'n</mark4><br>
Confusion, till I know not what I <mark4>am,</mark4><br>
Nor whence I am, nor whether I be <mark1>King.</mark1><br>
<mark4>Behold</mark4>, I seem but King among the <mark1>dead."</mark1><br>
<br>
Then spake the bold Sir Bedivere: "My <mark1>King,</mark1><br>
King everywhere! and so the dead have <mark4>kings,</mark4><br>
There also will I worship thee as <mark1>King.</mark1><br>
Yet still thy life is whole, and still I <mark4>live</mark4><br>
Who love thee; but who hates thee, he that <mark4>brought</mark4><br>
The heathen back among us, yonder <mark4>stands,</mark4><br>
Modred, unharm'd, the traitor of thine <mark4>house."</mark4><br>
<br>
Then spake the King: "My house hath been my <mark4>doom.</mark4><br>
But call not thou this traitor of my <mark1>house</mark1><br>
Who hath but dwelt beneath one roof with <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
My house are rather they who sware my <mark4>vows,</mark4><br>
Yea, even while they brake them, own'd me <mark1>King.</mark1><br>
And well for thee, saying in my dark <mark4>hour,</mark4><br>
When all the purport of my throne hath <mark4>fail'd,</mark4><br>
That quick or dead thou hottest me for <mark1>King.</mark1><br>
King am <mark3>I</mark3>, whatsoever be their <mark3>cry;</mark3><br>
And one last act of kinghood shalt thou <mark3>see</mark3><br>
Yet, ere I pass." And uttering this the <mark1>King</mark1><br>
Made at the man: then Modred smote his <mark4>liege</mark4><br>
Hard on that helm which many a heathen <mark4>sword</mark4><br>
Had beaten thin; while Arthur at one <mark3>blow,</mark3><br>
Striking the last stroke with <mark4>Excalibur,</mark4><br>
Slew him, and all but slain himself, he <mark1>fell.</mark1><br>
<br>
So all day long the noise of battle <mark4>roll'd</mark4><br>
Among the mountains by the winter <mark1>sea;</mark1><br>
Until King Arthur's Table, man by <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
Had fall'n in Lyonnesse about their <mark3>lord,</mark3><br>
King Arthur. Then, because his wound was <mark3>deep,</mark3><br>
The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted <mark4>him,</mark4><br>
And bore him to a chapel nigh the <mark1>field,</mark1><br>
A broken chancel with a broken <mark4>cross,</mark4><br>
That stood on a dark strait of barren <mark4>land:</mark4><br>
On one side lay the <mark4>Ocean</mark4>, and on <mark4>one</mark4><br>
Lay a great water, and the moon was <mark4>full.</mark4><br>
<br>
Then spake King Arthur to Sir <mark1>Bedivere:</mark1><br>
"The sequel of to-day unsolders <mark4>all</mark4><br>
The goodliest fellowship of famous <mark1>knights</mark1><br>
Whereof this world holds record. Such a <mark3>sleep</mark3><br>
They sleep--the men I loved. I think that <mark3>we</mark3><br>
Shall never more, at any future <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
Delight our souls with talk of knightly <mark4>deeds,</mark4><br>
Walking about the gardens and the <mark4>halls</mark4><br>
Of Camelot, as in the days that <mark3>were.</mark3><br>
I perish by this people which I <mark4>made,--</mark4><br>
Tho' Merlin sware that I should come <mark1>again</mark1><br>
To rule once more; but, let what will <mark1>be</mark1>, <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
I am so deeply smitten thro' the <mark4>helm</mark4><br>
That without help I cannot last till <mark4>morn.</mark4><br>
Thou therefore take my brand <mark1>Excalibur,</mark1><br>
Which was my pride: for thou rememberest <mark3>how</mark3><br>
In those old days, one summer noon, an <mark4>arm</mark4><br>
Rose up from out the bosom of the <mark4>lake,</mark4><br>
Clothed in white samite, mystic, <mark4>wonderful,</mark4><br>
Holding the sword--and how I row'd <mark4>across</mark4><br>
And took it, and have worn it, like a <mark1>king;</mark1><br>
<mark4>And</mark4>, wheresoever I am sung or <mark4>told</mark4><br>
In aftertime, this also shall be <mark4>known:</mark4><br>
But now delay not: take <mark1>Excalibur,</mark1><br>
And fling him far into the middle <mark4>mere:</mark4><br>
Watch what thou seest, and lightly bring me <mark4>word."</mark4><br>
<br>
To him replied the bold Sir <mark1>Bedivere:</mark1><br>
"It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee <mark4>thus,</mark4><br>
Aidless, alone, and smitten thro' the <mark1>helm--</mark1><br>
A little thing may harm a wounded <mark1>man;</mark1><br>
Yet I thy hest will all perform at <mark1>full,</mark1><br>
Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee <mark1>word."</mark1><br>
<br>
So saying, from the ruin'd shrine he <mark5>stept,</mark5><br>
And in the moon athwart the place of <mark4>tombs,</mark4><br>
Where lay the mighty bones of ancient <mark4>men,</mark4><br>
Old knights, and over them the sea-wind <mark4>sang</mark4><br>
Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping <mark1>down</mark1><br>
By zigzag paths, and juts of pointed <mark4>rock,</mark4><br>
Came on the shining levels of the <mark1>lake.</mark1><br>
<br>
There drew he forth the brand <mark1>Excalibur,</mark1><br>
And o'er him, drawing it, the winter <mark4>moon,</mark4><br>
Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran <mark4>forth</mark4><br>
And sparkled keen with frost against the <mark4>hilt:</mark4><br>
For all the haft twinkled with diamond <mark4>sparks,</mark4><br>
Myriads of topaz-lights, and <mark4>jacinth-work</mark4><br>
Of subtlest jewellery. He gazed so <mark1>long</mark1><br>
That both his eyes were dazzled as he <mark4>stood,</mark4><br>
This way and that dividing the swift <mark4>mind,</mark4><br>
In act to throw: but at the last it <mark4>seem'd</mark4><br>
Better to leave Excalibur <mark4>conceal'd</mark4><br>
There in the many-knotted waterflags, <br>
That whistled stiff and dry about the <mark4>marge.</mark4><br>
So strode he back slow to the wounded <mark1>King.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then spake King Arthur to Sir <mark1>Bedivere:</mark1><br>
"Hast thou perform'd my mission which I <mark4>gave?</mark4><br>
What is it thou hast seen? or what hast <mark4>heard?"</mark4><br>
<br>
And answer made the bold Sir <mark1>Bedivere:</mark1><br>
"I heard the ripple washing in the <mark4>reeds,</mark4><br>
And the wild water lapping on the <mark5>crag."</mark5><br>
<br>
To whom replied King Arthur, faint and <mark4>pale:</mark4><br>
"Thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy <mark4>name,</mark4><br>
Not rendering true answer, as beseem'd <br>
Thy fealty, nor like a noble <mark4>knight:</mark4><br>
For surer sign had follow'd, either <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
Or voice, or else a motion of the <mark1>mere.</mark1><br>
This is a shameful thing for men to <mark3>lie.</mark3><br>
Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go <mark1>again,</mark1><br>
As thou art lief and dear, and do the <mark3>thing</mark3><br>
I bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me <mark1>word."</mark1><br>
<br>
Then went Sir Bedivere the second <mark1>time</mark1><br>
Across the ridge, and paced beside the <mark1>mere,</mark1><br>
Counting the dewy pebbles, fix'd in <mark4>thought;</mark4><br>
But when he saw the wonder of the <mark1>hilt,</mark1><br>
How curiously and strangely chased, he smote <br>
His palms together, and he cried <mark4>aloud:</mark4><br>
<br>
"And if indeed I cast the brand <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
Surely a precious thing, one worthy <mark4>note,</mark4><br>
Should thus be lost for ever from the <mark4>earth,</mark4><br>
Which might have pleased the eyes of many <mark1>men.</mark1><br>
What good should follow this, if this were <mark4>done?</mark4><br>
What harm, undone? Deep harm to <mark3>disobey,</mark3><br>
Seeing obedience is the bond of <mark4>rule.</mark4><br>
Were it well to obey then, if a king <mark4>demand</mark4><br>
An act unprofitable, against <mark1>himself?</mark1><br>
The King is sick, and knows not what he <mark4>does.</mark4><br>
What <mark3>record</mark3>, or what relic of my <mark1>lord</mark1><br>
Should be to aftertime, but empty <mark4>breath</mark4><br>
And rumours of a doubt? But were this <mark4>kept,</mark4><br>
Stored in some treasure-house of mighty <mark1>kings,</mark1><br>
Some one might show it at a joust of <mark4>arms,</mark4><br>
Saying, 'King Arthur's sword, <mark1>Excalibur,</mark1><br>
Wrought by the lonely maiden of the <mark1>Lake.</mark1><br>
Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the <mark5>deeps</mark5><br>
Upon the hidden bases of the <mark1>hills.'</mark1><br>
So might some old man speak in the aftertime <br>
To all the people, winning <mark4>reverence.</mark4><br>
But now much honour and much fame were <mark4>lost."</mark4><br>
<br>
So spake he, clouded with his own <mark4>conceit,</mark4><br>
And hid Excalibur the second <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
And so strode back slow to the wounded <mark1>King.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then spoke King Arthur, breathing <mark4>heavily:</mark4><br>
"What is it thou hast seen? or what hast <mark1>heard?'</mark1><br>
<br>
And answer made the bold Sir <mark1>Bedivere:</mark1><br>
"I heard the water lapping on the <mark1>crag,</mark1><br>
And the long ripple washing in the <mark1>reeds."</mark1><br>
<br>
To whom replied King Arthur, much in <mark4>wrath:</mark4><br>
"Ah, miserable and unkind, <mark3>untrue,</mark3><br>
Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is <mark1>me!</mark1><br>
Authority forgets a dying <mark1>king,</mark1><br>
Laid widow'd of the power in his <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
That bow'd the will. I see thee what thou <mark4>art,</mark4><br>
For thou, the latest-left of all my <mark1>knights,</mark1><br>
In whom should meet the offices of <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
Thou wouldst betray me for the precious <mark1>hilt;</mark1><br>
Either from lust of gold, or like a <mark4>girl</mark4><br>
Valuing the giddy pleasure of the <mark4>eyes.</mark4><br>
Yet, for a man may fail in duty <mark4>twice,</mark4><br>
And the third time may prosper, get thee <mark4>hence:</mark4><br>
But, if thou spare to fling <mark1>Excalibur,</mark1><br>
I will arise and slay thee with my <mark4>hands."</mark4><br>
<br>
Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and <mark4>ran,</mark4><br>
And, leaping down the ridges, lightly, <mark4>plunged</mark4><br>
Among the bulrush beds, and clutch'd the <mark1>sword,</mark1><br>
And strongly wheel'd and threw it. The great <mark4>brand</mark4><br>
Made lightnings in the splendour of the <mark1>moon,</mark1><br>
And flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch, <br>
Shot like a streamer of the northern <mark1>morn,</mark1><br>
Seen where the moving isles of winter <mark4>shock</mark4><br>
By night, with noises of the Northern <mark1>Sea.</mark1><br>
So flash'd and fell the brand <mark1>Excalibur:</mark1><br>
But ere he dipt the surface, rose an <mark1>arm</mark1><br>
Clothed in white samite, mystic <mark1>wonderful,</mark1><br>
And caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd <mark1>him</mark1><br>
Three times, and drew him under in the <mark1>mere.</mark1><br>
And lightly went the other to the <mark1>King.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker <mark1>breath:</mark1><br>
"Now see I by thine eyes that this is <mark1>done.</mark1><br>
Speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or <mark4>seen?"</mark4><br>
<br>
And answer made the bold Sir <mark1>Bedivere:</mark1><br>
"Sir King, I closed mine <mark4>eyelids</mark4>, lest the <mark4>gems</mark4><br>
Should blind my purpose, for I never <mark1>saw,</mark1><br>
Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I <mark1>die,</mark1><br>
Not tho' I live three lives of mortal <mark1>men,</mark1><br>
So great a miracle as yonder <mark1>hilt.</mark1><br>
Then with both hands I flung <mark1>him</mark1>, wheeling <mark1>him;</mark1><br>
But when I look'd again, behold an <mark1>arm,</mark1><br>
Clothed in white samite, mystic, <mark1>wonderful,</mark1><br>
That caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd <mark1>him</mark1><br>
Three times, and drew him under in the <mark1>mere."</mark1><br>
<br>
And answer made King Arthur, breathing <mark4>hard:</mark4><br>
"My end draws nigh; 'tis time that I were <mark4>gone.</mark4><br>
Make broad thy shoulders to receive my <mark4>weight,</mark4><br>
And bear me to the margin; yet I <mark3>fear</mark3><br>
My wound hath taken cold, and I shall <mark1>die."</mark1><br>
<br>
So saying, from the pavement he half <mark4>rose,</mark4><br>
Slowly, with pain, reclining on his <mark1>arm,</mark1><br>
And looking wistfully with wide blue <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
As in a picture. Him Sir <mark1>Bedivere</mark1><br>
Remorsefully regarded thro' his <mark4>tears,</mark4><br>
And would have spoken, but he found not <mark4>words;</mark4><br>
Then took with care, and kneeling on one <mark3>knee,</mark3><br>
O'er both his shoulders drew the languid <mark1>hands,</mark1><br>
And rising bore him thro' the place of <mark1>tombs.</mark1><br>
<br>
But, as he walk'd, King Arthur panted <mark1>hard,</mark1><br>
Like one that feels a nightmare on his <mark4>bed</mark4><br>
When all the house is mute. So sigh'd the <mark1>King,</mark1><br>
Muttering and murmuring at his ear, <mark2>"Quick</mark2>, <mark4>quick!</mark4><br>
I fear it is too late, and I shall <mark1>die."</mark1><br>
But the other swiftly strode from ridge to <mark4>ridge,</mark4><br>
Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he <mark4>walk'd,</mark4><br>
Larger than human on the frozen <mark1>hills.</mark1><br>
He heard the deep behind him, and a <mark1>cry</mark1><br>
Before. His own thought drove him like a <mark4>goad.</mark4><br>
Dry clash'd his harness in the icy <mark4>caves</mark4><br>
And barren chasms, and all to left and <mark4>right</mark4><br>
The bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he <mark4>based</mark4><br>
His feet on juts of slippery crag that <mark4>rang</mark4><br>
Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed <mark4>heels--</mark4><br>
And on a sudden, lo! the level <mark1>lake,</mark1><br>
And the long glories of the winter <mark1>moon.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then saw they how there hove a dusky <mark4>barge,</mark4><br>
Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to <mark4>stern,</mark4><br>
Beneath them; and descending they were <mark4>ware</mark4><br>
That all the decks were dense with stately <mark4>forms,</mark4><br>
Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream--by <mark4>these</mark4><br>
Three Queens with crowns of gold: and from them <mark1>rose</mark1><br>
A cry that shiver'd to the tingling <mark1>stars,</mark1><br>
And, as it were one voice, an <mark4>agony</mark4><br>
Of lamentation, like a wind that <mark5>shrills</mark5><br>
All night in a waste land, where no one <mark4>comes,</mark4><br>
Or hath come, since the making of the <mark1>world.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then murmur'd Arthur, "Place me in the <mark1>barge."</mark1><br>
So to the barge they came. There those three <mark4>Queens</mark4><br>
Put forth their hands, and took the King, and <mark4>wept.</mark4><br>
But she, that rose the tallest of them <mark1>all</mark1><br>
And fairest, laid his head upon her <mark4>lap,</mark4><br>
And loosed the shatter'd casque, and chafed his <mark1>hands,</mark1><br>
And call'd him by his name, complaining <mark4>loud,</mark4><br>
And dropping bitter tears against a <mark3>brow</mark3><br>
Striped with dark blood: for all his face was <mark4>white</mark4><br>
And colourless, and like the wither'd <mark1>moon</mark1><br>
Smote by the fresh beam of the springing <mark4>east;</mark4><br>
And all his greaves and cuisses dash'd with <mark4>drops</mark4><br>
Of onset; and the light and lustrous <mark4>curls--</mark4><br>
That made his forehead like a rising <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
High from the dais-throne--were parch'd with <mark4>dust</mark4><br>
Or, clotted into points and hanging <mark4>loose,</mark4><br>
Mix'd with the knightly growth that fringed his <mark4>lips.</mark4><br>
So like a shatter'd column lay the <mark1>King;</mark1><br>
Not like that Arthur who, with lance in <mark4>rest,</mark4><br>
From spur to plume a star of <mark4>tournament,</mark4><br>
Shot thro' the lists at Camelot, and <mark4>charged</mark4><br>
Before the eyes of ladies and of <mark1>kings.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then loudly cried the bold Sir <mark1>Bedivere:</mark1><br>
"Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I <mark3>go?</mark3><br>
Where shall I hide my forehead and my <mark1>eyes?</mark1><br>
For now I see the true old times are <mark1>dead,</mark1><br>
When every morning brought a noble <mark4>chance,</mark4><br>
And every chance brought out a noble <mark1>knight.</mark1><br>
Such times have been not since the light that <mark3>led</mark3><br>
The holy Elders with the gift of <mark3>myrrh.</mark3><br>
But now the whole Round Table is <mark4>dissolved</mark4><br>
Which was an image of the mighty <mark1>world,</mark1><br>
And I, the last, go forth <mark5>companionless,</mark5><br>
And the days darken round me, and the <mark4>years,</mark4><br>
Among new men, strange <mark4>faces</mark4>, other <mark1>minds."</mark1><br>
<br>
And slowly answer'd Arthur from the <mark1>barge:</mark1><br>
"The old order changeth, yielding place to <mark3>new,</mark3><br>
And God fulfils himself in many <mark4>ways,</mark4><br>
Lest one good custom should corrupt the <mark1>world.</mark1><br>
Comfort thyself: what comfort is in <mark1>me?</mark1><br>
I have lived my life, and that which I have <mark1>done</mark1><br>
May He within himself make pure! but <mark3>thou,</mark3><br>
If thou shouldst never see my face <mark1>again,</mark1><br>
Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by <mark3>prayer</mark3><br>
Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy <mark1>voice</mark1><br>
Rise like a fountain for me night and <mark1>day.</mark1><br>
For what are men better than sheep or <mark4>goats</mark4><br>
That nourish a blind life within the <mark3>brain,</mark3><br>
If, knowing God, they lift not hands of <mark1>prayer</mark1><br>
Both for themselves and those who call them <mark1>friend?</mark1><br>
For so the whole round earth is every <mark1>way</mark1><br>
Bound by gold chains about the feet of <mark4>God.</mark4><br>
But now farewell. I am going a long <mark1>way</mark1><br>
With these thou seest--if indeed I <mark1>go</mark1><br>
(For all my mind is clouded with a <mark4>doubt)--</mark4><br>
To the island-valley of Avilion; <br>
Where falls not hail, or rain, or any <mark3>snow,</mark3><br>
Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it <mark4>lies</mark4><br>
Deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard <mark4>lawns</mark4><br>
And bowery hollows crown'd with summer <mark1>sea,</mark1><br>
Where I will heal me of my grievous <mark4>wound."</mark4><br>
<br>
So said he, and the barge with oar and <mark4>sail</mark4><br>
Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted <mark4>swan</mark4><br>
That, fluting a wild carol ere her <mark1>death,</mark1><br>
Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the <mark4>flood</mark4><br>
With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir <mark1>Bedivere</mark1><br>
Revolving many memories, till the <mark4>hull</mark4><br>
Look'd one black dot against the verge of <mark3>dawn,</mark3><br>
And on the mere the wailing died <mark1>away.</mark1><br>
<br>
But when that moan had past for <mark4>evermore,</mark4><br>
The stillness of the dead world's winter <mark1>dawn</mark1><br>
Amazed him, and he groan'd, The King is <mark1>gone.''</mark1><br>
And therewithal came on him the weird <mark4>rhyme,</mark4><br>
"From the great deep to the great deep he <mark4>goes."</mark4><br>
<br>
Whereat he slowly turn'd and slowly <mark5>clomb</mark5><br>
The last hard footstep of that iron <mark1>crag;</mark1><br>
Thence mark'd the black hull moving yet, and <mark4>cried,</mark4><br>
"He passes to be King among the <mark1>dead,</mark1><br>
And after healing of his grievous <mark1>wound</mark1><br>
He comes again; but--if he come no <mark1>more--</mark1><br>
O me, be yon dark Queens in yon black <mark4>boat,</mark4><br>
Who shriek'd and wail'd, the three whereat we <mark4>gazed</mark4><br>
On that high day, when, clothed with living <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
They stood before his throne in silence, <mark4>friends</mark4><br>
Of Arthur, who should help him at his <mark4>need?"</mark4><br>
<br>
Then from the dawn it seem'd there came, but <mark4>faint</mark4><br>
As from beyond the limit of the <mark1>world,</mark1><br>
Like the last echo born of a great <mark1>cry,</mark1><br>
Sounds, as if some fair city were one <mark1>voice</mark1><br>
Around a king returning from his <mark4>wars.</mark4><br>
<br>
Thereat once more he moved about, and <mark1>clomb</mark1><br>
Ev'n to the highest he could climb, and <mark1>saw,</mark1><br>
Straining his eyes beneath an arch of <mark1>hand,</mark1><br>
Or thought he saw, the speck that bare the <mark1>King,</mark1><br>
Down that long water opening on the <mark1>deep</mark1><br>
Somewhere far off, pass on and on, and <mark1>go</mark1><br>
From less to less and vanish into <mark1>light.</mark1><br>
And the new sun rose bringing the new <mark1>year.</mark1><br>
