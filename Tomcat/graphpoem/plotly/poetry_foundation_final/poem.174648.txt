Title : from The Princess: O Swallow <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

O Swallow, Swallow, flying, flying <mark1>South,</mark1><br>
Fly to her, and fall upon her gilded <mark4>eaves,</mark4><br>
And tell her, tell her, what I tell to <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
<br>
O tell her, Swallow, thou that knowest each, <br>
That bright and fierce and fickle is the <mark1>South,</mark1><br>
And dark and true and tender is the <mark4>North.</mark4><br>
<br>
O Swallow, Swallow, if I could follow, and <mark4>light</mark4><br>
Upon her lattice, I would pipe and trill, <br>
And cheep and twitter twenty million <mark4>loves.</mark4><br>
<br>
O were I thou that she might take me <mark4>in,</mark4><br>
And lay me on her bosom, and her <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
Would rock the snowy cradle till I <mark4>died.</mark4><br>
<br>
Why lingereth she to clothe her heart with <mark5>love,</mark5><br>
Delaying as the tender ash <mark4>delays</mark4><br>
To clothe herself, when all the woods are <mark4>green?</mark4><br>
<br>
O tell her, Swallow, that thy brood is <mark4>flown:</mark4><br>
Say to her, I do but wanton in the <mark1>South,</mark1><br>
But in the North long since my nest is <mark4>made.</mark4><br>
<br>
O tell her, brief is life but love is long, <br>
And brief the sun of summer in the <mark1>North,</mark1><br>
And brief the moon of beauty in the <mark1>South.</mark1><br>
<br>
O Swallow, flying from the golden <mark4>woods,</mark4><br>
Fly to her, and pipe and woo her, and make her <mark4>mine,</mark4><br>
And tell her, tell her, that I follow <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
