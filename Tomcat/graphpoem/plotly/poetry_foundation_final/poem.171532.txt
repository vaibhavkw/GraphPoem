of Paradys ne can not I speken propurly ffor I was not <mark4>there</mark4><br>
- <mark4>Mandeville</mark4><br>
The stars of the Great Bear drift <mark4>apart</mark4><br>
The Horse and the Rider together <mark4>northeastward</mark4><br>
Alpha and Omega <mark4>asunder</mark4><br>
The others diversely <br>
There are <mark4>rocks</mark4><br>
On the earth more <mark4>durable</mark4><br>
Than the configurations of <mark4>heaven</mark4><br>
Species now motile and <mark4>sanguine</mark4><br>
Shall see the stars in new <mark4>clusters</mark4><br>
The beaches <mark4>changed</mark4><br>
The mountains <mark4>shifted</mark4><br>
<br>
The faces appear and <mark4>disappear</mark4><br>
<br>
Chewing the right <mark4>gum</mark4><br>
Smoking the right <mark4>cigarette</mark4><br>
Buying the best <mark4>refrigerator</mark4><br>
The polished carnivorous <mark4>teeth</mark4><br>
Exhibited in <mark4>approval</mark4><br>
The <mark4>lights</mark4><br>
Of the <mark4>houses</mark4><br>
Draw <mark4>together</mark4><br>
In the evening dewfall on the <mark4>banks</mark4><br>
Of the <mark4>Wabash</mark4><br>
Sparkle <mark5>discreetly</mark5><br>
High on the road to <mark4>Provo</mark4><br>
Above the Salt Lake <mark4>Valley</mark4><br>
The mountain shaped like a <mark4>sphinx</mark4><br>
<br>
The mountain shaped like a <mark4>finger</mark4><br>
<br>
On the first of April at eight <mark4>o'clock</mark4><br>
<br>
Precisely at <mark4>Algol</mark4><br>
There are rocks on the <mark4>earth</mark4><br>
And one who <mark4>sleepless</mark4><br>
Throbbed with the <mark4>ten</mark4><br>
Nightingales in the plum <mark4>trees</mark4><br>
Sleepless as Bootes stood over <mark4>him</mark4><br>
Gnawing the <mark4>pillow</mark4><br>
Sitting on the bed's edge <mark4>smoking</mark4><br>
Sitting by the window <mark4>looking</mark4><br>
One who rose in the <mark4>false</mark4><br>
Dawn and <mark4>stoned</mark4><br>
The nightingales in the <mark4>garden</mark4><br>
The heart pawned for <mark4>wisdom</mark4><br>
The <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
Bartered for knowledge and <mark4>folly</mark4><br>
The will <mark4>troubled</mark4><br>
The mind secretly <mark4>aghast</mark4><br>
The eyes and lips full of <mark4>sorrow</mark4><br>
The apices of vision <mark4>wavering</mark4><br>
As the flower spray at the tip of the <mark5>windstalk</mark5><br>
The becalmed <mark4>sail</mark4><br>
The heavy wordless <mark4>weight</mark4><br>
And now <br>
The anguishing and pitiless <mark4>file</mark4><br>
Cutting away <mark4>life</mark4><br>
Capsule by capsule <mark4>biting</mark4><br>
Into the <mark1>heart</mark1><br>
The coal of <mark4>fire</mark4><br>
Sealing the <mark4>lips</mark4><br>
There are rocks on <mark1>earth</mark1><br>
In the Japanese <mark4>quarter</mark4><br>
<br>
A phonograph <mark4>playing</mark4><br>
<br>
"Moonlight on ruined <mark4>castles"</mark4><br>
Kojo <mark4>n'suki</mark4><br>
The movement of the wind <mark4>fish</mark4><br>
Keeping time to the <mark4>music</mark4><br>
<br>
Sirius setting behind <mark4>it</mark4><br>
(The Dog has scented the <mark4>sun)</mark4><br>
Gold immense <mark1>fish</mark1><br>
Squirm in the trade <mark4>wind</mark4><br>
"Young Middle Western <mark4>woman</mark4><br>
In <mark4>rut</mark4><br>
Desires <mark4>correspondent"</mark4><br>
The first bright <mark4>flower</mark4><br>
The blue hound's <mark4>tongue</mark4><br>
Breaks on the <mark4>hill</mark4><br>
"The tide has gone <mark4>down</mark4><br>
<br>
Over the <mark4>reef</mark4><br>
I walk about the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
There is <mark4>great</mark4><br>
Wind and then <mark4>rain"</mark4><br>
"My life is bought and paid <mark4>for</mark4><br>
So much <mark4>pleasure</mark4><br>
For so much <mark3>pain"</mark3><br>
The folded <mark4>fossiliferous</mark4><br>
Sedimentary rocks end <mark4>here</mark4><br>
The granite <mark4>batholith</mark4><br>
Obtrudes <mark4>abruptly</mark4><br>
West of the fault <mark4>line</mark4><br>
Betelgeuse reddens <br>
Drawing its substance about <mark1>it</mark1><br>
It is possible that a process is <mark4>beginning</mark4><br>
Similar to that which <mark4>lifted</mark4><br>
The great Sierra fault <mark4>block</mark4><br>
Through an older metamorphic range <br>
(The Dog barks on the sun's <mark4>spoor)</mark4><br>
The thought of <mark4>death</mark4><br>
Binds fast the flood of <mark4>light</mark4><br>
<br>
Ten years ago the snow <mark4>falling</mark4><br>
<br>
All a long winter <mark3>night</mark3><br>
<br>
I had lain waking in my bed <mark4>alone</mark4><br>
Turning my heavy <mark4>thoughts</mark4><br>
And no way <mark3>might</mark3><br>
Remembering divers things long <mark4>gone</mark4><br>
In the long day in the hour of small shadow   <br>
I walk on the continent's last western <mark1>hill</mark1><br>
And lie prone among the iris in the <mark4>grass</mark4><br>
<br>
My eyes fixed on the durable <mark4>stone</mark4><br>
<br>
That speaks and hears as though it were <mark4>myself</mark4><br>
