Title : Between Assassinations <br>
Author : Alan R. Shapiro <br><br>

Old court. Old chain net hanging in frayed links from the <mark4>rim,</mark4><br>
the metal blackboard dented, darker where the <mark4>ball</mark4><br>
for over thirty years has kissed it, the blacktop <mark4>buckling,</mark4><br>
the white lines nearly worn away. Old common <mark4>ground</mark4><br>
where none of the black men warming up before the <mark4>basket</mark4><br>
will answer or even look in my direction when I ask   <br>
if I can run too, the chill a mutual <mark4>understanding,</mark4><br>
one of the last we <mark4>share</mark4>, letting me join them <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
if nowhere else, by not letting me forget I don't <mark4>belong.</mark4><br>
<br>
Old court. Old courtesy, handshake, exchange of <mark4>names,</mark4><br>
in the early days of bussing, between <mark4>assassinations,</mark4><br>
before our quaint welcoming of them had come to <mark4>seem,</mark4><br>
even to ourselves, the haughty overflow of wealth   <br>
so thoroughly our own we didn't need to see <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
Old beautiful delusion in those courtly <mark4>gestures</mark4><br>
that everything now beyond our wanting just to play <br>
was out of <mark4>bounds</mark4>, and we were free between the white <mark4>lines</mark4><br>
of whatever we assumed we each of us <mark4>assumed.</mark4><br>
<br>
Old court, old dream dreamed by the weave, the trap,   <br>
the backdoor pass. Old fluid legacy, among the <mark4>others,</mark4><br>
that conjures even now within our bodies and between <mark4>them</mark4><br>
such a useless, such an intimate forgetting, as in the <mark4>moment</mark4><br>
when you get a step on your defender and can <mark4>tell</mark4><br>
exactly by how another man comes at you <br>
where your own man is and, without looking, lob the <mark1>ball</mark1><br>
up in the air so perfectly as he arrives <mark4>that</mark4><br>
in a single motion he can catch and finger roll it <mark4>in.</mark4><br>
<br>
Old court. Old dwindling cease fire, with no hope of peace,   <br>
that we silently turn away from when the game is over,   <br>
hurrying back (as if believing contact meant <mark4>contagion)</mark4><br>
to our separate tribes, to the cleansing fires of <mark4>what,</mark4><br>
despite ourselves, we momentarily <mark4>forgot:</mark4><br>
old lore, old news, old burning certitudes we <mark4>can't</mark4><br>
stoke high or hot enough, yet won't stop ever <mark4>stoking</mark4><br>
until whatever it is we think we are anneals <br>
and toughens into an impenetrable <mark4>shield.</mark4><br>
