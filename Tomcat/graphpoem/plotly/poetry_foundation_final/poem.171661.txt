(homage Jacob van Hoddis)<br>
The CIA and the KGB exchange Christmas <mark4>cards</mark4><br>
A blade snaps in two during an autopsy <br>
The bouquet Bluebeard gave his first date reblooms <br>
Many protest the public stoning of a guitar pick <br>
<br>
Railroad trains drop off the bourgeois' pointy head <br>
A martyr sticks a coffeecup out under a firehose <br>
Moviestars make hyenas lick their spaceship <br>
God's hand descends into a glove held steady by the police <br>
<br>
At their reunion The New Faces recognize each <mark4>other</mark4><br>
A spoiled child sleeps inside a <mark4>thermometer</mark4><br>
A single misprint in a survival manual kills everyone <br>
The peace night makes according to the world <mark4>comes</mark4><br>
