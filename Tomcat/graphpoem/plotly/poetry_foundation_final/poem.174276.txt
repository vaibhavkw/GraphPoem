Title : The House of Life: 22. Heart's Haven <br>
Author : Dante Gabriel Rossetti <br><br>

Sometimes she is a child within mine <mark3>arms,</mark3><br>
Cowering beneath dark wings that love must <mark3>chase,?</mark3><br>
With still tears showering and averted <mark3>face,</mark3><br>
Inexplicably fill'd with faint <mark3>alarms:</mark3><br>
And oft from mine own spirit's hurtling <mark3>harms</mark3><br>
I crave the refuge of her deep <mark3>embrace,?</mark3><br>
Against all ills the fortified strong <mark3>place</mark3><br>
And sweet reserve of sovereign <mark3>counter-charms.</mark3><br>
<br>
And Love, our light at night and shade at <mark3>noon,</mark3><br>
Lulls us to rest with songs, and turns <mark3>away</mark3><br>
All shafts of shelterless tumultuous <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
Like the moon's growth, his face gleams through his <mark3>tune;</mark3><br>
And as soft waters warble to the <mark3>moon,</mark3><br>
         Our answering spirits chime one roundelay.<br>
