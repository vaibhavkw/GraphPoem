Title : Summer <br>
Author : John Clare <br><br>

Come we to the summer, to the summer we will <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
For the woods are full of bluebells and the hedges full of <mark4>bloom,</mark4><br>
And the crow is on the oak a-building of her <mark3>nest,</mark3><br>
And love is burning diamonds in my true lover's <mark3>breast;</mark3><br>
She sits beneath the whitethorn a-plaiting of her <mark3>hair,</mark3><br>
And I will to my true lover with a fond request <mark3>repair;</mark3><br>
I will look upon her face, I will in her beauty <mark3>rest,</mark3><br>
And lay my aching weariness upon her lovely <mark1>breast.</mark1><br>
<br>
The clock-a-clay is creeping on the open bloom of <mark3>May,</mark3><br>
The merry bee is trampling the pinky threads all <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
And the chaffinch it is brooding on its grey mossy <mark1>nest</mark1><br>
In the whitethorn bush where I will lean upon my lover's <mark1>breast;</mark1><br>
I'll lean upon her breast and I'll whisper in her <mark4>ear</mark4><br>
That I cannot get a wink o'sleep for thinking of my <mark3>dear;</mark3><br>
I hunger at my meat and I daily fade <mark3>away</mark3><br>
Like the hedge rose that is broken in the heat of the <mark1>day.</mark1><br>
