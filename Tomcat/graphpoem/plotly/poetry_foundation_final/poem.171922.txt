Title : Dreamers <br>
Author : Siegfried Sassoon <br><br>

Soldiers are citizens of death's grey <mark3>land,</mark3><br>
Drawing no dividend from time's <mark4>to-morrows.</mark4><br>
In the great hour of destiny they <mark3>stand,</mark3><br>
Each with his feuds, and <mark4>jealousies</mark4>, and <mark4>sorrows.</mark4><br>
Soldiers are sworn to <mark4>action</mark4>, they must <mark4>win</mark4><br>
Some flaming, fatal climax with their <mark4>lives.</mark4><br>
Soldiers are dreamers; when the guns <mark3>begin</mark3><br>
They think of firelit <mark4>homes</mark4>, clean beds and <mark3>wives.</mark3><br>
<br>
I see them in foul <mark4>dug-outs</mark4>, gnawed by <mark4>rats,</mark4><br>
And in the ruined trenches, lashed with <mark4>rain,</mark4><br>
Dreaming of things they did with balls and <mark3>bats,</mark3><br>
And mocked by hopeless longing to <mark3>regain</mark3><br>
Bank-holidays, and picture shows, and <mark3>spats,</mark3><br>
And going to the office in the <mark3>train.</mark3><br>
