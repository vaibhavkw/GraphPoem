Title : Neighbors in October <br>
Author : David Baker <br><br>

All afternoon his tractor pulls a flat <mark4>wagon</mark4><br>
with bales to the barn, then back to the waiting <br>
chopped field. It trails a feather of smoke. <br>
Down the block we bend with the <mark4>season:</mark4><br>
shoes to polish for a big <mark4>game,</mark4><br>
storm windows to batten or patch. <br>
And how like a field is the whole sky now <br>
that the maples have shed their leaves, too. <br>
It makes us believers--stationed in groups, <br>
leaning on rakes, looking into space. We rub blisters <br>
over billows of leaf smoke. Or stand <mark4>alone,</mark4><br>
bagging gold for the cold days to <mark4>come.</mark4><br>
