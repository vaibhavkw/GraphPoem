Title : On the Lawn at the Villa <br>
Author : Louis Simpson <br><br>

On the lawn at the <mark1>villa--</mark1><br>
That's the way to start, eh, reader? <br>
We know where we stand--somewhere <mark5>expensive--</mark5><br>
You and I imperturbes, as Walt would say, <br>
Before the diversions of wealth, you and I <mark4>engages.</mark4><br>
<br>
On the lawn at the <mark1>villa</mark1><br>
Sat a manufacturer of <mark4>explosives,</mark4><br>
His wife from Paris, <br>
And a young man named Bruno, <br>
<br>
And myself, being <mark4>American,</mark4><br>
Willing to talk to these <mark4>malefactors,</mark4><br>
The manufacturer of explosives, and so <mark4>on,</mark4><br>
But somehow superior. By that I mean democratic. <br>
It's complicated, being an <mark1>American,</mark1><br>
Having the money and the bad conscience, both at the same <mark4>time.</mark4><br>
Perhaps, after all, this is not the right subject for a <mark4>poem.</mark4><br>
<br>
We were all sitting there paralyzed <br>
In the hot Tuscan <mark4>afternoon,</mark4><br>
And the bodies of the machine-gun crew were draped over the balcony. <br>
So we sat there all <mark1>afternoon.</mark1><br>
