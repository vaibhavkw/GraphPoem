Title : God's Judgment on a Wicked Bishop <br>
Author : Robert Southey <br><br>

<br>
The summer and autumn had been so <mark3>wet,</mark3><br>
That in winter the corn was growing <mark3>yet,</mark3><br>
'Twas a piteous sight to see all <mark3>around</mark3><br>
The grain lie rotting on the <mark3>ground.</mark3><br>
<br>
Every day the starving <mark4>poor</mark4><br>
Crowded around Bishop Hatto's <mark4>door,</mark4><br>
For he had a plentiful last-year's <mark3>store,</mark3><br>
And all the neighbourhood could <mark3>tell</mark3><br>
His granaries were furnish'd <mark3>well.</mark3><br>
<br>
At last Bishop Hatto appointed a <mark3>day</mark3><br>
To quiet the poor without <mark3>delay;</mark3><br>
He bade them to his great Barn <mark4>repair,</mark4><br>
And they should have food for the winter <mark3>there.</mark3><br>
<br>
Rejoiced such tidings good to <mark4>hear,</mark4><br>
The poor folk flock'd from far and <mark4>near;</mark4><br>
The great barn was full as it could <mark4>hold</mark4><br>
Of women and children, and young and <mark3>old.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then when he saw it could hold no <mark4>more,</mark4><br>
Bishop Hatto he made fast the <mark1>door;</mark1><br>
And while for mercy on Christ they <mark4>call,</mark4><br>
He set fire to the Barn and burnt them <mark3>all.</mark3><br>
<br>
"I'faith 'tis an excellent bonfire!" quoth <mark3>he,</mark3><br>
"And the country is greatly obliged to <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
For ridding it in these times <mark4>forlorn</mark4><br>
Of Rats that only consume the <mark3>corn."</mark3><br>
<br>
So then to his palace returned <mark1>he,</mark1><br>
And he sat down to supper <mark4>merrily,</mark4><br>
And he slept that night like an innocent <mark4>man;</mark4><br>
But Bishop Hatto never slept <mark4>again.</mark4><br>
<br>
In the morning as he enter'd the <mark3>hall</mark3><br>
Where his picture hung against the <mark3>wall,</mark3><br>
A sweat like death all over him <mark3>came,</mark3><br>
For the Rats had eaten it out of the <mark3>frame.</mark3><br>
<br>
As he look'd there came a man from his <mark4>farm--</mark4><br>
He had a countenance white with <mark3>alarm;</mark3><br>
"My Lord, I open'd your granaries this <mark4>morn,</mark4><br>
And the Rats had eaten all your <mark1>corn."</mark1><br>
<br>
Another came running <mark4>presently,</mark4><br>
And he was pale as pale could <mark4>be,</mark4><br>
"Fly! my Lord Bishop, fly," quoth <mark1>he,</mark1><br>
"Ten thousand Rats are coming this <mark3>way,...</mark3><br>
The Lord forgive you for <mark4>yesterday!"</mark4><br>
<br>
"I'll go to my tower on the Rhine," replied <mark1>he,</mark1><br>
"'Tis the safest place in <mark4>Germany;</mark4><br>
The walls are high and the shores are <mark3>steep,</mark3><br>
And the stream is strong and the water <mark3>deep."</mark3><br>
<br>
Bishop Hatto fearfully hasten'd <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
And he crost the Rhine without <mark1>delay,</mark1><br>
And reach'd his tower, and barr'd with <mark4>care</mark4><br>
All the windows, doors, and loop-holes <mark1>there.</mark1><br>
<br>
He laid him down and closed his <mark3>eyes;...</mark3><br>
But soon a scream made him <mark3>arise,</mark3><br>
He started and saw two eyes of <mark4>flame</mark4><br>
On his pillow from whence the screaming <mark1>came.</mark1><br>
<br>
He listen'd and look'd;... it was only the <mark4>Cat;</mark4><br>
And the Bishop he grew more fearful for <mark3>that,</mark3><br>
For she sat screaming, mad with <mark4>fear</mark4><br>
At the Army of Rats that were drawing <mark1>near.</mark1><br>
<br>
For they have swum over the river so <mark1>deep,</mark1><br>
And they have climb'd the shores so <mark1>steep,</mark1><br>
And up the Tower their way is <mark4>bent,</mark4><br>
To do the work for which they were <mark3>sent.</mark3><br>
<br>
They are not to be told by the dozen or <mark4>score,</mark4><br>
By thousands they come, and by myriads and <mark1>more,</mark1><br>
Such numbers had never been heard of <mark3>before,</mark3><br>
Such a judgment had never been witness'd of <mark3>yore.</mark3><br>
<br>
Down on his knees the Bishop <mark4>fell,</mark4><br>
And faster and faster his beads did he <mark1>tell,</mark1><br>
As louder and louder drawing <mark1>near</mark1><br>
The gnawing of their teeth he could <mark1>hear.</mark1><br>
<br>
And in at the windows and in at the <mark1>door,</mark1><br>
And through the walls helter-skelter they <mark3>pour,</mark3><br>
And down from the ceiling and up through the <mark3>floor,</mark3><br>
From the right and the left, from behind and <mark1>before,</mark1><br>
From within and without, from above and <mark3>below,</mark3><br>
And all at once to the Bishop they <mark3>go.</mark3><br>
<br>
They have whetted their teeth against the <mark4>stones,</mark4><br>
And now they pick the Bishop's <mark3>bones:</mark3><br>
They gnaw'd the flesh from every <mark4>limb,</mark4><br>
For they were sent to do judgment on <mark3>him!</mark3><br>
