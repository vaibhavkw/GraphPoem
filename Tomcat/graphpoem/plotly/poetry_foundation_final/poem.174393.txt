Title : A Lament <br>
Author : Percy Bysshe Shelley <br><br>

O world! O life! O <mark3>time!</mark3><br>
On whose last steps I <mark3>climb,</mark3><br>
Trembling at that where I had stood <mark3>before;</mark3><br>
When will return the glory of your <mark3>prime?</mark3><br>
No more?Oh, never <mark3>more!</mark3><br>
<br>
Out of the day and <mark3>night</mark3><br>
A joy has taken <mark3>flight;</mark3><br>
Fresh spring, and summer, and winter <mark3>hoar,</mark3><br>
Move my faint heart with grief, but with <mark3>delight</mark3><br>
No more?Oh, never <mark1>more!</mark1><br>
