Title : Mary Morison <br>
Author : Robert Burns <br><br>

O <mark4>Mary</mark4>, at thy window <mark4>be,</mark4><br>
It is the wish'd, the trysted <mark4>hour!</mark4><br>
Those smiles and glances let me <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
That makes the miser's treasure <mark4>poor:</mark4><br>
How blythely wad I bide the stoure, <br>
A weary slave frae sun to <mark4>sun,</mark4><br>
Could I the rich reward <mark4>secure,</mark4><br>
The lovely Mary <mark4>Morison.</mark4><br>
<br>
Yestreen when to the trembling <mark3>string</mark3><br>
         The dance gaed thro' the lighted ha' <br>
To thee my fancy took its <mark3>wing,</mark3><br>
         I sat, but neither heard nor saw: <br>
Tho' this was fair, and that was braw, <br>
And yon the toast of a' the <mark4>town,</mark4><br>
I sigh'd, and said amang them a', <br>
"Ye are na Mary <mark1>Morison."</mark1><br>
<br>
O Mary, canst thou wreck his peace, <br>
         Wha for thy sake wad gladly die? <br>
Or canst thou break that heart of his, <br>
Whase only faut is loving <mark3>thee?</mark3><br>
If love for love thou wilt na gie <br>
At least be pity to me <mark4>shown:</mark4><br>
A thought ungentle canna <mark1>be</mark1><br>
The thought o' Mary <mark1>Morison.</mark1><br>
