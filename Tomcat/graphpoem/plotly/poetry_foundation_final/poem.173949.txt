Title : An Horatian Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland <br>
Author : Andrew Marvell <br><br>

The forward youth that would <mark3>appear</mark3><br>
Must now forsake his Muses <mark3>dear,</mark3><br>
Nor in the shadows <mark4>sing</mark4><br>
His numbers <mark4>languishing.</mark4><br>
'Tis time to leave the books in <mark3>dust,</mark3><br>
And oil th' unused armour's <mark3>rust,</mark3><br>
Removing from the <mark3>wall</mark3><br>
The corslet of the <mark3>hall.</mark3><br>
So restless Cromwell could not <mark3>cease</mark3><br>
In the inglorious arts of <mark3>peace,</mark3><br>
But thorough advent'rous <mark4>war</mark4><br>
Urged his active <mark4>star.</mark4><br>
And like the three-fork'd lightning, <mark4>first</mark4><br>
Breaking the clouds where it was nurst,<br>
Did through his own <mark3>side</mark3><br>
His fiery way <mark3>divide.</mark3><br>
For 'tis all one to courage <mark3>high,</mark3><br>
The emulous or <mark4>enemy;</mark4><br>
And with such to <mark3>enclose</mark3><br>
Is more than to <mark3>oppose.</mark3><br>
Then burning through the air he <mark4>went,</mark4><br>
And palaces and temples <mark3>rent;</mark3><br>
And Caesar's head at <mark4>last</mark4><br>
Did through his laurels <mark3>blast.</mark3><br>
'Tis madness to resist or <mark5>blame</mark5><br>
The force of angry Heaven's <mark3>flame;</mark3><br>
And, if we would speak <mark3>true,</mark3><br>
Much to the man is <mark3>due,</mark3><br>
Who from his private gardens <mark4>where</mark4><br>
He liv'd reserved and <mark4>austere,</mark4><br>
As if his highest <mark4>plot</mark4><br>
         To plant the bergamot,<br>
Could by industrious valour <mark4>climb</mark4><br>
To ruin the great work of <mark3>time,</mark3><br>
And cast the kingdom <mark4>old</mark4><br>
Into another <mark3>mould.</mark3><br>
Though justice against fate <mark3>complain,</mark3><br>
And plead the ancient rights in <mark3>vain;</mark3><br>
But those do hold or <mark4>break</mark4><br>
As men are strong or <mark4>weak.</mark4><br>
Nature that hateth <mark4>emptiness</mark4><br>
Allows of penetration <mark4>less,</mark4><br>
And therefore must make <mark4>room</mark4><br>
Where greater spirits <mark4>come.</mark4><br>
What field of all the civil <mark4>wars</mark4><br>
Where his were not the deepest <mark4>scars?</mark4><br>
And Hampton shows what <mark4>part</mark4><br>
He had of wiser <mark3>art,</mark3><br>
Where, twining subtle fears with <mark3>hope,</mark3><br>
He wove a net of such a <mark3>scope</mark3><br>
That Charles himself might <mark4>chase</mark4><br>
To Carisbrooke's narrow <mark3>case,</mark3><br>
That thence the royal actor <mark4>borne</mark4><br>
The tragic scaffold might <mark3>adorn,</mark3><br>
While round the armed <mark4>bands</mark4><br>
Did clap their bloody <mark3>hands.</mark3><br>
He nothing common did or <mark4>mean</mark4><br>
Upon that memorable <mark3>scene,</mark3><br>
But with his keener <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
The axe's edge did <mark3>try;</mark3><br>
Nor call'd the gods with vulgar <mark4>spite</mark4><br>
To vindicate his helpless <mark3>right,</mark3><br>
But bowed his comely <mark4>head</mark4><br>
Down as upon a <mark3>bed.</mark3><br>
This was that memorable <mark4>hour</mark4><br>
Which first assur'd the forced <mark4>pow'r.</mark4><br>
So when they did <mark4>design</mark4><br>
The Capitol's first <mark3>line,</mark3><br>
A bleeding head, where they <mark4>begun,</mark4><br>
Did fright the architects to <mark3>run;</mark3><br>
And yet in that the <mark4>state</mark4><br>
Foresaw its happy <mark3>fate.</mark3><br>
And now the Irish are asham'd<br>
To see themselves in one year <mark4>tam'd;</mark4><br>
So much one man can <mark2>do</mark2><br>
         That does both act and know.<br>
They can affirm his praises <mark4>best,</mark4><br>
And have, though overcome, confest<br>
How good he is, how <mark4>just,</mark4><br>
And fit for highest <mark3>trust;</mark3><br>
Nor yet grown stiffer with <mark4>command,</mark4><br>
But still in the republic's <mark3>hand;</mark3><br>
How fit he is to <mark3>sway</mark3><br>
That can so well <mark3>obey.</mark3><br>
He to the Commons' feet <mark4>presents</mark4><br>
A kingdom for his first year's <mark3>rents;</mark3><br>
         And, what he may, forbears<br>
His fame, to make it <mark4>theirs,</mark4><br>
And has his sword and spoils ungirt,<br>
To lay them at the public's <mark4>skirt.</mark4><br>
So when the falcon <mark1>high</mark1><br>
Falls heavy from the <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
She, having kill'd, no more does <mark3>search</mark3><br>
But on the next green bough to <mark3>perch,</mark3><br>
<mark4>Where</mark4>, when he first does <mark4>lure,</mark4><br>
The falc'ner has her <mark3>sure.</mark3><br>
What may not then our isle <mark4>presume</mark4><br>
While victory his crest does <mark3>plume!</mark3><br>
What may not others <mark4>fear</mark4><br>
If thus he crown each <mark3>year!</mark3><br>
A Caesar he ere long to <mark3>Gaul,</mark3><br>
To Italy an <mark4>Hannibal,</mark4><br>
And to all states not <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
Shall climacteric <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
The Pict no shelter now shall <mark4>find</mark4><br>
Within his parti-colour'd <mark3>mind;</mark3><br>
But from this valour <mark4>sad</mark4><br>
Shrink underneath the <mark3>plaid,</mark3><br>
Happy if in the tufted <mark4>brake</mark4><br>
The English hunter him <mark3>mistake,</mark3><br>
Nor lay his hounds in <mark3>near</mark3><br>
The Caledonian <mark3>deer.</mark3><br>
But thou, the war's and fortune's <mark3>son,</mark3><br>
March indefatigably <mark4>on;</mark4><br>
And for the last <mark4>effect</mark4><br>
Still keep thy sword <mark3>erect;</mark3><br>
Besides the force it has to <mark4>fright</mark4><br>
The spirits of the shady <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
The same arts that did <mark4>gain</mark4><br>
A pow'r, must it <mark3>maintain.</mark3><br>
