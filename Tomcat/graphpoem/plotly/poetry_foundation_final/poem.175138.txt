Title : Brahma <br>
Author : Ralph Waldo Emerson <br><br>

If the red slayer think he <mark5>slays,</mark5><br>
Or if the slain think he is <mark5>slain,</mark5><br>
They know not well the subtle <mark4>ways</mark4><br>
I keep, and pass, and turn <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
<br>
Far or forgot to me is <mark3>near;</mark3><br>
Shadow and sunlight are the <mark3>same;</mark3><br>
The vanished gods to me <mark3>appear;</mark3><br>
And one to me are shame and <mark3>fame.</mark3><br>
<br>
They reckon ill who leave me <mark3>out;</mark3><br>
When me they fly, I am the <mark4>wings;</mark4><br>
I am the doubter and the <mark3>doubt,</mark3><br>
I am the hymn the Brahmin <mark3>sings.</mark3><br>
<br>
The strong gods pine for my <mark4>abode,</mark4><br>
And pine in vain the sacred <mark4>Seven;</mark4><br>
But thou, meek lover of the <mark4>good!</mark4><br>
Find me, and turn thy back on <mark3>heaven.</mark3><br>
