Title : Babylon Revisited <br>
Author : Amiri Baraka <br><br>

The gaunt <mark4>thing</mark4><br>
with no <mark1>organs</mark1><br>
creeps along the <mark4>streets</mark4><br>
of Europe, she will <br>
commute, in her feathered bat <mark4>stomach-gown</mark4><br>
with no <mark1>organs</mark1><br>
with sores on her <mark4>insides</mark4><br>
even her <mark4>head</mark4><br>
a vast puschamber   <br>
of pus(sy) <mark4>memories</mark4><br>
with no <mark1>organs</mark1><br>
nothing to make <mark4>babies</mark4><br>
she will be the great witch of euro-american <mark4>legend</mark4><br>
who sucked the life <br>
from some unknown <mark4>nigger</mark4><br>
whose name will be <mark4>known</mark4><br>
but whose substance will not <mark4>ever</mark4><br>
not even by <mark4>him</mark4><br>
who is dead in a pile of dopeskin <br>
<br>
This bitch killed a friend of mine named Bob <mark4>Thompson</mark4><br>
a black painter, a giant, once, she <mark4>reduced</mark4><br>
to a pitiful imitation <mark4>faggot</mark4><br>
full of American holes and a monkey on his back   <br>
slapped <mark4>airplanes</mark4><br>
from the empire state <mark4>building</mark4><br>
<br>
May this bitch and her sisters, all of <mark4>them,</mark4><br>
receive my <mark4>words</mark4><br>
in all their orifices like lye mixed with   <br>
cocola and alaga syrup <br>
<br>
feel this shit, bitches, feel it, now laugh your   <br>
hysterectic <mark4>laughs</mark4><br>
while your flesh <mark4>burns</mark4><br>
and your eyes peel to red <mark4>mud</mark4><br>
