Title : The Retreat <br>
Author : Henry Vaughan <br><br>

Happy those early days! when <mark3>I</mark3><br>
Shined in my angel <mark4>infancy.</mark4><br>
Before I understood this <mark3>place</mark3><br>
Appointed for my second <mark3>race,</mark3><br>
Or taught my soul to fancy <mark3>aught</mark3><br>
But a <mark4>white</mark4>, celestial <mark3>thought;</mark3><br>
When yet I had not walked <mark3>above</mark3><br>
A mile or two from my first <mark3>love,</mark3><br>
And looking back, at that short <mark3>space,</mark3><br>
Could see a glimpse of His bright <mark3>face;</mark3><br>
When on some gilded cloud or <mark3>flower</mark3><br>
My gazing soul would dwell an <mark3>hour,</mark3><br>
And in those weaker glories <mark3>spy</mark3><br>
Some shadows of <mark4>eternity;</mark4><br>
Before I taught my tongue to <mark3>wound</mark3><br>
My conscience with a sinful <mark3>sound,</mark3><br>
Or had the black art to <mark4>dispense</mark4><br>
A several sin to every <mark3>sense,</mark3><br>
But felt through all this fleshly <mark4>dress</mark4><br>
Bright shoots of everlastingness. <br>
O, how I long to travel <mark3>back,</mark3><br>
And tread again that ancient <mark3>track!</mark3><br>
That I might once more reach that <mark5>plain</mark5><br>
Where first I left my glorious <mark3>train,</mark3><br>
From whence th' enlightened spirit <mark3>sees</mark3><br>
That shady city of palm <mark3>trees.</mark3><br>
But, ah! my soul with too much <mark3>stay</mark3><br>
Is drunk, and staggers in the <mark3>way.</mark3><br>
Some men a forward motion <mark1>love;</mark1><br>
But I by backward steps would <mark4>move,</mark4><br>
And when this dust falls to the <mark4>urn,</mark4><br>
In that state I came, <mark3>return.</mark3><br>
