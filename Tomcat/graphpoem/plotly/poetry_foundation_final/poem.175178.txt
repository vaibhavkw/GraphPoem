Title : Tom Deadlight (1810) <br>
Author : Herman Melville <br><br>

During a tempest encountered homeward-bound from the Mediterranean, a grizzled petty-officer, one of the two captains of the forecastle, dying at night in his hammock, swung in the sick-bay under the tiered gun-decks of the British Dreadnought, 98, wandering in his mind, though with glimpses of sanity, and starting up at whiles, sings by snatches his good-bye and last injunctions to two messmates, his watchers, one of whom fans the fevered tar with the flap of his old sou'-wester. Some names and phrases, with here and there a line, or part of one; these, in his aberration, wrested into incoherency from their original connection and import, he involuntarily derives, as he does the measure, from a famous old sea-ditty, whose cadences, long rife, and now humming in the collapsing brain, attune the last flutterings of distempered <mark4>thought.</mark4><br>
Farewell and adieu to you noble hearties,--<br>
Farewell and adieu to you ladies of <mark3>Spain,</mark3><br>
For I've received orders for to sail for the <mark1>Deadman,</mark1><br>
But hope with the grand fleet to see you <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
<br>
I have hove my ship to, with main-top-sail aback, <mark4>boys;</mark4><br>
I have hove my ship to, for to strike soundings <mark3>clear--</mark3><br>
The black scud a'flying; but, by God's blessing, dam' me,<br>
Right up the Channel for the Deadman I'll <mark3>steer.</mark3><br>
<br>
I have worried through the waters that are call d the <mark4>Doldrums,</mark4><br>
And growled at Sargasso that clogs while ye <mark3>grope--</mark3><br>
Blast my eyes, but the light-ship is hid by the mist, <mark4>lads:--</mark4><br>
Flying Dutchman--odds bobbs--off the Cape of Good <mark3>Hope!</mark3><br>
<br>
But what's this I feel that is fanning my cheek, <mark4>Matt?</mark4><br>
The white goney's wing?--how she rolls!--'t is the <mark4>Cape!</mark4><br>
Give my kit to the mess, Jock, for kin none is <mark4>mine</mark4>, <mark4>none;</mark4><br>
      And tell Holy Joe to avast with the crape.<br>
<br>
Dead reckoning, says Joe, it won't do to go by;<br>
But they doused all the glims, <mark4>Matt</mark4>, in sky t' other <mark4>night.</mark4><br>
Dead reckoning is good for to sail for the <mark1>Deadman;</mark1><br>
And Tom Deadlight he thinks it may reckon near <mark3>right.</mark3><br>
<br>
The signal!--it streams for the grand fleet to <mark4>anchor.</mark4><br>
The captains--the trumpets--the <mark3>hullabaloo!</mark3><br>
Stand by for <mark4>blue-blazes</mark4>, and mind your <mark4>shank-painters,</mark4><br>
For the Lord High Admiral, he's squinting at <mark3>you!</mark3><br>
<br>
But give me my tot, Matt, before I roll <mark4>over;</mark4><br>
Jock, let's have your flipper, it's good for to <mark3>feel;</mark3><br>
And don't sew me up without baccy in mouth, <mark1>boys,</mark1><br>
And don't blubber like lubbers when I turn up my <mark3>keel.</mark3><br>
