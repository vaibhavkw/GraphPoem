Title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 67 <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

When on my bed the moonlight <mark3>falls,</mark3><br>
I know that in thy place of <mark3>rest</mark3><br>
By that broad water of the <mark3>west,</mark3><br>
There comes a glory on the <mark3>walls:</mark3><br>
<br>
Thy marble bright in dark <mark4>appears,</mark4><br>
As slowly steals a silver <mark3>flame</mark3><br>
Along the letters of thy <mark3>name,</mark3><br>
And o'er the number of thy <mark3>years.</mark3><br>
<br>
The mystic glory swims <mark3>away;</mark3><br>
From off my bed the moonlight <mark4>dies;</mark4><br>
And closing eaves of wearied <mark3>eyes</mark3><br>
I sleep till dusk is dipt in <mark3>gray:</mark3><br>
<br>
And then I know the mist is <mark3>drawn</mark3><br>
A lucid veil from coast to <mark4>coast,</mark4><br>
And in the dark church like a <mark3>ghost</mark3><br>
Thy tablet glimmers to the <mark3>dawn.</mark3><br>
