Title : The Man He Killed <br>
Author : Thomas Hardy <br><br>

"Had he and I but <mark3>met</mark3><br>
By some old ancient <mark4>inn,</mark4><br>
We should have sat us down to <mark3>wet</mark3><br>
            Right many a nipperkin! <br>
<br>
            "But ranged as infantry, <br>
And staring face to <mark3>face,</mark3><br>
I shot at him as he at me, <br>
And killed him in his <mark3>place.</mark3><br>
<br>
"I shot him dead because <mark3>--</mark3><br>
Because he was my <mark3>foe,</mark3><br>
Just so: my foe of course he <mark3>was;</mark3><br>
That's clear enough; <mark3>although</mark3><br>
<br>
"He thought he'd 'list, <mark4>perhaps,</mark4><br>
Off-hand like -- just as I <mark3>--</mark3><br>
Was out of work -- had sold his traps <mark3>--</mark3><br>
No other reason <mark3>why.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Yes; quaint and curious war <mark4>is!</mark4><br>
You shoot a fellow <mark4>down</mark4><br>
You'd treat if met where any bar <mark1>is,</mark1><br>
            Or help to half-a-crown." <br>
