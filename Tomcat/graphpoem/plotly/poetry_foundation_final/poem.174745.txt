Title : Song of Myself (1892 version) <br>
Author : Walt Whitman <br><br>

<br>
I celebrate <mark1>myself</mark1>, and sing <mark1>myself,</mark1><br>
And what I assume you shall <mark4>assume,</mark4><br>
For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to <mark3>you.</mark3><br>
<br>
I loafe and invite my <mark4>soul,</mark4><br>
I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer <mark4>grass.</mark4><br>
<br>
My tongue, every atom of my blood, form'd from this soil, this <mark4>air,</mark4><br>
Born here of parents born here from parents the <mark1>same</mark1>, and their parents the <mark4>same,</mark4><br>
I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health <mark4>begin,</mark4><br>
Hoping to cease not till <mark3>death.</mark3><br>
<br>
Creeds and schools in <mark4>abeyance,</mark4><br>
Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never <mark4>forgotten,</mark4><br>
I harbor for good or <mark4>bad</mark4>, I permit to speak at every <mark4>hazard,</mark4><br>
Nature without check with original <mark4>energy.</mark4><br>
<br>
Houses and rooms are full of <mark1>perfumes</mark1>, the shelves are crowded with <mark1>perfumes,</mark1><br>
I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the distillation, it is <mark4>odorless,</mark4><br>
<br>
It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and <mark4>naked,</mark4><br>
I am mad for it to be in contact with <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
The smoke of my own <mark3>breath,</mark3><br>
<br>
Echoes, ripples, buzz'd whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and <mark4>vine,</mark4><br>
My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing of blood and air through my <mark4>lungs,</mark4><br>
The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and dark-color'd sea-rocks, and of hay in the <mark4>barn,</mark4><br>
The sound of the belch'd words of my voice loos'd to the eddies of the <mark4>wind,</mark4><br>
A few light kisses, a few <mark4>embraces</mark4>, a reaching around of <mark4>arms,</mark4><br>
The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs <mark5>wag,</mark5><br>
The delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and <mark4>hill-sides,</mark4><br>
The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising from bed and meeting the <mark4>sun.</mark4><br>
Have you reckon'd a thousand acres much? have you reckon'd the earth <mark4>much?</mark4><br>
<br>
Have you practis'd so long to learn to <mark4>read?</mark4><br>
Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of <mark4>poems?</mark4><br>
Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all <mark1>poems,</mark1><br>
<br>
You shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions of suns <mark4>left,)</mark4><br>
You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in <mark4>books,</mark4><br>
You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your <mark3>self.</mark3><br>
I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the beginning and the <mark4>end,</mark4><br>
<br>
But I do not talk of the beginning or the <mark1>end.</mark1><br>
There was never any more inception than there is <mark1>now,</mark1><br>
Nor any more youth or age than there is <mark1>now,</mark1><br>
<br>
And will never be any more perfection than there is <mark1>now,</mark1><br>
Nor any more heaven or hell than there is <mark1>now.</mark1><br>
Urge and urge and <mark4>urge,</mark4><br>
Always the procreant urge of the <mark4>world.</mark4><br>
<br>
Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and <mark4>increase</mark4>, always <mark4>sex,</mark4><br>
Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of <mark4>life.</mark4><br>
<br>
To elaborate is no avail, learn'd and unlearn'd feel that it is <mark3>so.</mark3><br>
Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well entretied, braced in the <mark4>beams,</mark4><br>
<br>
Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, <mark4>electrical,</mark4><br>
<br>
I and this mystery here we <mark4>stand.</mark4><br>
Clear and sweet is my <mark1>soul</mark1>, and clear and sweet is all that is not my <mark1>soul.</mark1><br>
Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the <mark4>seen,</mark4><br>
<br>
Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its <mark4>turn.</mark4><br>
<br>
Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes <mark4>age,</mark4><br>
Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they discuss I am silent, and go bathe and admire <mark1>myself.</mark1><br>
<br>
Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty and <mark4>clean,</mark4><br>
Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be less familiar than the <mark4>rest.</mark4><br>
<br>
I am satisfied--I see, dance, laugh, <mark4>sing;</mark4><br>
As the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the night, and withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy <mark4>tread,</mark4><br>
<br>
Leaving me baskets cover'd with white towels swelling the house with their <mark4>plenty,</mark4><br>
Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
That they turn from gazing after and down the <mark4>road,</mark4><br>
And forthwith cipher and show me to a <mark4>cent,</mark4><br>
Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which is <mark4>ahead?</mark4><br>
Trippers and askers surround <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
People I meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and city I live <mark4>in</mark4>, or the <mark4>nation,</mark4><br>
<br>
The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and <mark3>new,</mark3><br>
My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, <mark4>dues,</mark4><br>
The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I <mark5>love,</mark5><br>
The sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or loss or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations, <br>
Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news, the fitful <mark4>events;</mark4><br>
These come to me days and nights and go from me <mark4>again,</mark4><br>
But they are not the Me <mark1>myself.</mark1><br>
Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I <mark4>am,</mark4><br>
Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, <mark4>unitary,</mark4><br>
Looks down, is <mark4>erect</mark4>, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain <mark1>rest,</mark1><br>
<br>
Looking with side-curved head curious what will come <mark3>next,</mark3><br>
Both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with linguists and <mark4>contenders,</mark4><br>
I have no mockings or arguments, I witness and <mark4>wait.</mark4><br>
I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
<br>
And you must not be abased to the <mark4>other.</mark4><br>
Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your <mark4>throat,</mark4><br>
<br>
Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not even the <mark4>best,</mark4><br>
Only the lull I like, the hum of your valved <mark4>voice.</mark4><br>
I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer <mark4>morning,</mark4><br>
<br>
How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn'd over upon <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript <mark4>heart,</mark4><br>
And reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till you held my <mark4>feet.</mark4><br>
<br>
Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the <mark4>earth,</mark4><br>
And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my <mark4>own,</mark4><br>
And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my <mark1>own,</mark1><br>
And that all the men ever born are also my <mark4>brothers</mark4>, and the women my sisters and <mark4>lovers,</mark4><br>
<br>
And that a kelson of the creation is <mark1>love,</mark1><br>
And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the <mark4>fields,</mark4><br>
And brown ants in the little wells beneath <mark3>them,</mark3><br>
And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap'd stones, elder, mullein and <mark4>poke-weed.</mark4><br>
A child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with full <mark4>hands;</mark4><br>
How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any more than <mark3>he.</mark3><br>
I guess it must be the flag of my <mark4>disposition</mark4>, out of hopeful green stuff <mark4>woven.</mark4><br>
Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the <mark4>Lord,</mark4><br>
<br>
A scented gift and remembrancer designedly <mark5>dropt,</mark5><br>
Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say <mark4>Whose?</mark4><br>
Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the <mark4>vegetation.</mark4><br>
<br>
Or I guess it is a uniform <mark4>hieroglyphic,</mark4><br>
<br>
And it <mark4>means</mark4>, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow <mark4>zones,</mark4><br>
Growing among black folks as among <mark4>white,</mark4><br>
Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the <mark1>same</mark1>, I receive them the <mark1>same.</mark1><br>
<br>
And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of <mark4>graves.</mark4><br>
<br>
Tenderly will I use you curling <mark1>grass,</mark1><br>
It may be you transpire from the breasts of young <mark4>men,</mark4><br>
It may be if I had known them I would have loved <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out of their mothers' <mark4>laps,</mark4><br>
<br>
And here you are the mothers' <mark1>laps.</mark1><br>
<br>
This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old <mark4>mothers,</mark4><br>
Darker than the colorless beards of old <mark1>men,</mark1><br>
Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of <mark4>mouths.</mark4><br>
O I perceive after all so many uttering <mark4>tongues,</mark4><br>
And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for <mark4>nothing.</mark4><br>
<br>
I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and <mark4>women,</mark4><br>
And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of their <mark1>laps.</mark1><br>
What do you think has become of the young and old <mark1>men?</mark1><br>
<br>
And what do you think has become of the women and <mark4>children?</mark4><br>
They are alive and well <mark4>somewhere,</mark4><br>
<br>
The smallest sprout shows there is really no <mark1>death,</mark1><br>
And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to arrest <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
<br>
And ceas'd the moment life <mark4>appear'd.</mark4><br>
All goes onward and outward, nothing <mark4>collapses,</mark4><br>
<br>
And to die is different from what any one supposed, and <mark4>luckier.</mark4><br>
Has any one supposed it lucky to be <mark4>born?</mark4><br>
I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I know <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
I pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash'd babe, and am not contain'd between my hat and <mark4>boots,</mark4><br>
<br>
And peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one <mark4>good,</mark4><br>
The earth good and the stars <mark1>good</mark1>, and their adjuncts all <mark1>good.</mark1><br>
<br>
I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an <mark1>earth,</mark1><br>
I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and fathomless as <mark1>myself,</mark1><br>
(They do not know how immortal, but I <mark3>know.)</mark3><br>
<br>
Every kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and <mark4>female,</mark4><br>
For me those that have been boys and that love <mark1>women,</mark1><br>
For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be <mark4>slighted,</mark4><br>
<br>
For me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and the mothers of <mark1>mothers,</mark1><br>
For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed <mark4>tears,</mark4><br>
For me children and the begetters of <mark1>children.</mark1><br>
<br>
Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor <mark4>discarded,</mark4><br>
I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or <mark2>no,</mark2><br>
And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
The little one sleeps in its <mark4>cradle,</mark4><br>
I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away flies with my <mark4>hand.</mark4><br>
The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy <mark4>hill,</mark4><br>
<br>
I peeringly view them from the <mark4>top.</mark4><br>
The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the <mark4>bedroom,</mark4><br>
I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, I note where the pistol has <mark4>fallen.</mark4><br>
<br>
The blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of the <mark5>promenaders,</mark5><br>
The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the clank of the shod horses on the granite <mark4>floor,</mark4><br>
The snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of <mark4>snow-balls,</mark4><br>
<br>
The hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous'd <mark4>mobs,</mark4><br>
The flap of the curtain'd litter, a sick man inside borne to the <mark4>hospital,</mark4><br>
<br>
The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and <mark4>fall,</mark4><br>
The excited <mark1>crowd</mark1>, the policeman with his star quickly working his passage to the centre of the <mark4>crowd,</mark4><br>
<br>
The impassive stones that receive and return so many <mark4>echoes,</mark4><br>
What groans of over-fed or half-starv'd who fall sunstruck or in <mark4>fits,</mark4><br>
What exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and give birth to <mark4>babes,</mark4><br>
What living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what howls restrain'd by <mark4>decorum,</mark4><br>
Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances, rejections with convex <mark4>lips,</mark4><br>
I mind them or the show or resonance of them--I come and I <mark4>depart.</mark4><br>
The big doors of the country barn stand open and <mark4>ready,</mark4><br>
The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn <mark4>wagon,</mark4><br>
The clear light plays on the brown gray and green <mark5>intertinged,</mark5><br>
The armfuls are pack'd to the sagging <mark3>mow.</mark3><br>
I am there, I help, I came stretch'd atop of the <mark4>load,</mark4><br>
I felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the <mark1>other,</mark1><br>
I jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and <mark4>timothy,</mark4><br>
<br>
And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of <mark5>wisps.</mark5><br>
Alone far in the wilds and mountains I <mark4>hunt,</mark4><br>
Wandering amazed at my own lightness and <mark3>glee,</mark3><br>
In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill'd <mark4>game,</mark4><br>
<br>
Falling asleep on the gather'd leaves with my dog and gun by my <mark4>side.</mark4><br>
The Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle and <mark4>scud,</mark4><br>
My eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout joyously from the <mark4>deck.</mark4><br>
The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
<br>
I tuck'd my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good <mark4>time;</mark4><br>
You should have been with us that day round the <mark4>chowder-kettle.</mark4><br>
I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west, the bride was a red <mark4>girl,</mark4><br>
Her father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly smoking, they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their <mark4>shoulders,</mark4><br>
On a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck, he held his bride by the <mark1>hand,</mark1><br>
She had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach'd to her <mark1>feet.</mark1><br>
<br>
The runaway slave came to my house and stopt <mark4>outside,</mark4><br>
<br>
I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the <mark4>woodpile,</mark4><br>
<br>
Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and <mark4>weak,</mark4><br>
And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured <mark4>him,</mark4><br>
And brought water and fill'd a tub for his sweated body and bruis'd <mark1>feet,</mark1><br>
<br>
And gave him a room that enter'd from my own, and gave him some coarse clean <mark4>clothes,</mark4><br>
And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his <mark4>awkwardness,</mark4><br>
And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and <mark4>ankles;</mark4><br>
He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass'd <mark4>north,</mark4><br>
<br>
I had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean'd in the <mark4>corner.</mark4><br>
Twenty-eight young men bathe by the <mark3>shore,</mark3><br>
Twenty-eight young men and all so <mark4>friendly;</mark4><br>
Twenty-eight years of womanly life and all so <mark4>lonesome.</mark4><br>
She owns the fine house by the rise of the <mark4>bank,</mark4><br>
She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the <mark5>window.</mark5><br>
Which of the young men does she like the <mark1>best?</mark1><br>
Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to <mark5>her.</mark5><br>
Where are you off <mark3>to</mark3>, lady? for I see <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your <mark4>room.</mark4><br>
<br>
Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth <mark4>bather,</mark4><br>
The rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
The beards of the young men glisten'd with wet, it ran from their long <mark4>hair,</mark4><br>
Little streams pass'd all over their <mark4>bodies.</mark4><br>
<br>
An unseen hand also pass'd over their <mark1>bodies,</mark1><br>
It descended tremblingly from their temples and <mark4>ribs.</mark4><br>
<br>
The young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge to the sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending <mark4>arch,</mark4><br>
<br>
They do not think whom they souse with <mark3>spray.</mark3><br>
The butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his knife at the stall in the <mark4>market,</mark4><br>
<br>
I loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and <mark4>break-down.</mark4><br>
Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the <mark4>anvil,</mark4><br>
<br>
Each has his main-sledge, they are all out, there is a great heat in the <mark4>fire.</mark4><br>
From the cinder-strew'd threshold I follow their <mark4>movements,</mark4><br>
<br>
The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive <mark1>arms,</mark1><br>
Overhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so <mark4>sure,</mark4><br>
<br>
They do not hasten, each man hits in his <mark4>place.</mark4><br>
The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block swags underneath on its tied-over <mark4>chain,</mark4><br>
The negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady and tall he stands pois'd on one leg on the <mark4>string-piece,</mark4><br>
<br>
His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over his <mark4>hip-band,</mark4><br>
His glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of his hat away from his <mark4>forehead,</mark4><br>
The sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the black of his polish'd and perfect <mark4>limbs.</mark4><br>
<br>
I behold the picturesque giant and love him, and I do not stop <mark4>there,</mark4><br>
I go with the team <mark4>also.</mark4><br>
<br>
In me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well as forward sluing, <br>
To niches aside and junior <mark4>bending</mark4>, not a person or object <mark4>missing,</mark4><br>
Absorbing all to myself and for this <mark4>song.</mark4><br>
Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade, what is that you express in your <mark1>eyes?</mark1><br>
<br>
It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my <mark1>life.</mark1><br>
My tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my distant and day-long <mark4>ramble,</mark4><br>
They rise together, they slowly circle <mark4>around.</mark4><br>
I believe in those wing'd <mark4>purposes,</mark4><br>
And acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
And consider green and violet and the tufted crown <mark4>intentional,</mark4><br>
<br>
And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something <mark4>else,</mark4><br>
And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
<br>
And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
The wild gander leads his flock through the cool <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
Ya-honk he says, and sounds it down to me like an <mark4>invitation,</mark4><br>
<br>
The pert may suppose it <mark4>meaningless</mark4>, but I listening <mark4>close,</mark4><br>
Find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
<br>
The sharp-hoof'd moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the chickadee, the <mark4>prairie-dog,</mark4><br>
The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her <mark4>teats,</mark4><br>
<br>
The brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread <mark4>wings,</mark4><br>
I see in them and myself the same old <mark3>law.</mark3><br>
The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred <mark4>affections,</mark4><br>
They scorn the best I can do to relate <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
I am enamour'd of growing <mark4>out-doors,</mark4><br>
Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or <mark4>woods,</mark4><br>
<br>
Of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and mauls, and the drivers of <mark4>horses,</mark4><br>
I can eat and sleep with them week in and week <mark4>out.</mark4><br>
What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is <mark1>Me,</mark1><br>
Me going in for my <mark4>chances</mark4>, spending for vast <mark4>returns,</mark4><br>
Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
<br>
Not asking the sky to come down to my good <mark4>will,</mark4><br>
Scattering it freely <mark4>forever.</mark4><br>
The pure contralto sings in the organ <mark4>loft,</mark4><br>
The carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane whistles its wild ascending <mark4>lisp,</mark4><br>
<br>
The married and unmarried children ride home to their Thanksgiving <mark4>dinner,</mark4><br>
The pilot seizes the king-pin, he heaves down with a strong <mark4>arm,</mark4><br>
<br>
The mate stands braced in the whale-boat, lance and harpoon are <mark1>ready,</mark1><br>
The duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious <mark4>stretches,</mark4><br>
The deacons are ordain'd with cross'd hands at the <mark4>altar,</mark4><br>
The spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big <mark4>wheel,</mark4><br>
<br>
The farmer stops by the bars as he walks on a First-day loafe and looks at the oats and <mark3>rye,</mark3><br>
The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirm'd <mark4>case,</mark4><br>
(He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mother's <mark4>bed-room;)</mark4><br>
The jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his <mark1>case,</mark1><br>
He turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the <mark4>manuscript;</mark4><br>
<br>
The malform'd limbs are tied to the surgeon's <mark4>table,</mark4><br>
What is removed drops horribly in a <mark4>pail;</mark4><br>
The quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand, the drunkard nods by the bar-room <mark4>stove,</mark4><br>
The machinist rolls up his sleeves, the policeman travels his beat, the gate-keeper marks who <mark4>pass,</mark4><br>
The young fellow drives the express-wagon, (I love <mark1>him</mark1>, though I do not know <mark1>him;)</mark1><br>
The half-breed straps on his light boots to compete in the <mark4>race,</mark4><br>
<br>
The western turkey-shooting draws old and young, some lean on their <mark4>rifles</mark4>, some sit on <mark4>logs,</mark4><br>
Out from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position, levels his <mark4>piece;</mark4><br>
The groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or <mark4>levee,</mark4><br>
As the woolly-pates hoe in the sugar-field, the overseer views them from his <mark4>saddle,</mark4><br>
The bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run for their partners, the dancers bow to each <mark1>other,</mark1><br>
The youth lies awake in the cedar-roof'd garret and harks to the musical <mark4>rain,</mark4><br>
The Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the <mark4>Huron,</mark4><br>
The squaw wrapt in her yellow-hemm'd cloth is offering moccasins and bead-bags for <mark4>sale,</mark4><br>
The connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with half-shut eyes bent <mark4>sideways,</mark4><br>
As the deck-hands make fast the steamboat the plank is thrown for the shore-going <mark4>passengers,</mark4><br>
The young sister holds out the skein while the elder sister winds it off in a ball, and stops now and then for the <mark4>knots,</mark4><br>
The one-year wife is recovering and happy having a week ago borne her first <mark4>child,</mark4><br>
The clean-hair'd Yankee girl works with her sewing-machine or in the factory or <mark4>mill,</mark4><br>
The paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer, the reporter's lead flies swiftly over the note-book, the sign-painter is lettering with blue and <mark4>gold,</mark4><br>
The canal boy trots on the tow-path, the book-keeper counts at his desk, the shoemaker waxes his <mark4>thread,</mark4><br>
The conductor beats time for the band and all the performers follow <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
The child is baptized, the convert is making his first <mark4>professions,</mark4><br>
The regatta is spread on the bay, the race is begun, (how the white sails <mark4>sparkle!)</mark4><br>
The drover watching his drove sings out to them that would <mark3>stray,</mark3><br>
The pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser higgling about the odd <mark1>cent;)</mark1><br>
The bride unrumples her white dress, the minute-hand of the clock moves <mark4>slowly,</mark4><br>
The opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-open'd <mark1>lips,</mark1><br>
The prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her tipsy and pimpled <mark4>neck,</mark4><br>
The crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and wink to each <mark1>other,</mark1><br>
(Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer <mark1>you;)</mark1><br>
The President holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the great <mark4>Secretaries,</mark4><br>
On the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with twined <mark1>arms,</mark1><br>
The crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in the <mark4>hold,</mark4><br>
The Missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his <mark4>cattle,</mark4><br>
As the fare-collector goes through the train he gives notice by the jingling of loose <mark4>change,</mark4><br>
The floor-men are laying the floor, the tinners are tinning the roof, the masons are calling for <mark4>mortar,</mark4><br>
In single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the <mark4>laborers;</mark4><br>
Seasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is gather'd, it is the fourth of Seventh-month, (what salutes of cannon and small <mark1>arms!)</mark1><br>
Seasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs, the mower mows, and the winter-grain falls in the <mark4>ground;</mark4><br>
Off on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole in the frozen <mark4>surface,</mark4><br>
The stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter strikes deep with his <mark4>axe,</mark4><br>
Flatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cotton-wood or <mark4>pecan-trees,</mark4><br>
Coon-seekers go through the regions of the Red river or through those drain'd by the Tennessee, or through those of the Arkansas, <br>
Torches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahooche or Altamahaw, <br>
Patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and great-grandsons around <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
In walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers after their day's <mark4>sport,</mark4><br>
The city sleeps and the country <mark4>sleeps,</mark4><br>
The living sleep for their <mark1>time</mark1>, the dead sleep for their <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
The old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband sleeps by his <mark3>wife;</mark3><br>
And these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
And such as it is to be of these more or less I <mark1>am,</mark1><br>
And of these one and all I weave the song of <mark1>myself.</mark1><br>
I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the <mark4>wise,</mark4><br>
Regardless of <mark1>others</mark1>, ever regardful of <mark4>others,</mark4><br>
Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a <mark4>man,</mark4><br>
Stuff'd with the stuff that is coarse and stuff'd with the stuff that is <mark4>fine,</mark4><br>
One of the Nation of many nations, the smallest the same and the largest the <mark1>same,</mark1><br>
A Southerner soon as a Northerner, a planter nonchalant and hospitable down by the Oconee I <mark4>live,</mark4><br>
<br>
A Yankee bound my own way ready for trade, my joints the limberest joints on earth and the sternest joints on <mark1>earth,</mark1><br>
A Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deer-skin leggings, a Louisianian or <mark4>Georgian,</mark4><br>
A boatman over lakes or bays or along coasts, a Hoosier, Badger, Buckeye; <br>
At home on Kanadian snow-shoes or up in the bush, or with fishermen off <mark4>Newfoundland,</mark4><br>
At home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the rest and <mark4>tacking,</mark4><br>
At home on the hills of Vermont or in the woods of Maine, or the Texan <mark4>ranch,</mark4><br>
Comrade of Californians, comrade of free <mark4>North-Westerners</mark4>, (loving their big <mark4>proportions,)</mark4><br>
Comrade of raftsmen and coalmen, comrade of all who shake hands and welcome to drink and <mark4>meat,</mark4><br>
<br>
A learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfullest, <br>
A novice beginning yet experient of myriads of <mark4>seasons,</mark4><br>
Of every hue and caste am I, of every rank and <mark4>religion,</mark4><br>
A farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, <mark4>sailor</mark4>, <mark4>quaker,</mark4><br>
Prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, <mark4>priest.</mark4><br>
I resist any thing better than my own <mark4>diversity,</mark4><br>
Breathe the air but leave plenty after <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
And am not stuck up, and am in my <mark1>place.</mark1><br>
(The moth and the fish-eggs are in their <mark1>place,</mark1><br>
The bright suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see are in their <mark1>place,</mark1><br>
The palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its <mark1>place.)</mark1><br>
These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
If they are not yours as much as mine they are <mark1>nothing</mark1>, or next to <mark1>nothing,</mark1><br>
If they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are <mark1>nothing,</mark1><br>
If they are not just as close as they are distant they are <mark1>nothing.</mark1><br>
This is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the water <mark4>is,</mark4><br>
This the common air that bathes the <mark1>globe.</mark1><br>
With music strong I come, with my cornets and my <mark4>drums,</mark4><br>
I play not marches for accepted victors only, I play marches for conquer'd and slain <mark4>persons.</mark4><br>
Have you heard that it was good to gain the <mark3>day?</mark3><br>
<br>
I also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are <mark4>won.</mark4><br>
I beat and pound for the <mark4>dead,</mark4><br>
I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
<br>
Vivas to those who have <mark4>fail'd!</mark4><br>
And to those whose war-vessels sank in the <mark3>sea!</mark3><br>
And to those themselves who sank in the <mark1>sea!</mark1><br>
<br>
And to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome <mark4>heroes!</mark4><br>
And the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes <mark4>known!</mark4><br>
This is the meal equally set, this the meat for natural <mark4>hunger,</mark4><br>
It is for the wicked just the same as the righteous, I make appointments with <mark4>all,</mark4><br>
I will not have a single person slighted or left <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
<br>
The kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby <mark4>invited,</mark4><br>
The heavy-lipp'd slave is <mark1>invited</mark1>, the venerealee is <mark1>invited;</mark1><br>
<br>
There shall be no difference between them and the <mark1>rest.</mark1><br>
This is the press of a bashful hand, this the float and odor of <mark1>hair,</mark1><br>
This the touch of my lips to yours, this the murmur of <mark4>yearning,</mark4><br>
<br>
This the far-off depth and height reflecting my own <mark3>face,</mark3><br>
This the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet <mark1>again.</mark1><br>
<br>
Do you guess I have some intricate <mark4>purpose?</mark4><br>
Well I have, for the Fourth-month showers have, and the mica on the side of a rock <mark4>has.</mark4><br>
<br>
Do you take it I would <mark4>astonish?</mark4><br>
Does the daylight astonish? does the early redstart twittering through the <mark1>woods?</mark1><br>
Do I astonish more than <mark3>they?</mark3><br>
This hour I tell things in <mark4>confidence,</mark4><br>
I might not tell everybody, but I will tell <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
<br>
Who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, <mark4>nude;</mark4><br>
How is it I extract strength from the beef I <mark4>eat?</mark4><br>
What is a man anyhow? what am I? what are <mark1>you?</mark1><br>
All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your <mark1>own,</mark1><br>
Else it were time lost listening to <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
I do not snivel that snivel the world <mark4>over,</mark4><br>
That months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and <mark4>filth.</mark4><br>
<br>
Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids, conformity goes to the fourth-remov'd, <br>
I wear my hat as I please indoors or <mark1>out.</mark1><br>
Why should I pray? why should I venerate and be <mark5>ceremonious?</mark5><br>
Having pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counsel'd with doctors and calculated <mark1>close,</mark1><br>
<br>
I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own <mark4>bones.</mark4><br>
In all people I see myself, none more and not one a barley-corn <mark4>less,</mark4><br>
<br>
And the good or bad I say of myself I say of <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
I know I am solid and <mark4>sound,</mark4><br>
To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually <mark3>flow,</mark3><br>
<br>
All are written to me, and I must get what the writing <mark4>means.</mark4><br>
I know I am <mark5>deathless,</mark5><br>
<br>
I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter's <mark4>compass,</mark4><br>
I know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue cut with a burnt stick at <mark1>night.</mark1><br>
I know I am <mark4>august,</mark4><br>
<br>
I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be <mark4>understood,</mark4><br>
<br>
I see that the elementary laws never <mark4>apologize,</mark4><br>
(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by, after <mark1>all.)</mark1><br>
<br>
I exist as I am, that is <mark4>enough,</mark4><br>
If no other in the world be aware I sit <mark4>content,</mark4><br>
<br>
And if each and all be aware I sit <mark1>content.</mark1><br>
One world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is <mark1>myself,</mark1><br>
<br>
And whether I come to my own to-day or in ten thousand or ten million <mark4>years,</mark4><br>
<br>
I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can <mark1>wait.</mark1><br>
My foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in <mark4>granite,</mark4><br>
<br>
I laugh at what you call <mark4>dissolution,</mark4><br>
And I know the amplitude of <mark1>time.</mark1><br>
<br>
I am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the <mark1>Soul,</mark1><br>
The pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are with <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
The first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I translate into a new <mark4>tongue.</mark4><br>
<br>
I am the poet of the woman the same as the <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of <mark1>men.</mark1><br>
<br>
I chant the chant of dilation or <mark4>pride,</mark4><br>
We have had ducking and deprecating about <mark1>enough,</mark1><br>
I show that size is only <mark4>development.</mark4><br>
Have you outstript the rest? are you the <mark4>President?</mark4><br>
<br>
It is a trifle, they will more than arrive there every <mark4>one</mark4>, and still pass <mark4>on.</mark4><br>
I am he that walks with the tender and growing <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
I call to the earth and sea half-held by the <mark1>night.</mark1><br>
<br>
Press close bare-bosom'd night--press close magnetic nourishing <mark1>night!</mark1><br>
Night of south winds--night of the large few <mark4>stars!</mark4><br>
Still nodding night--mad naked summer <mark1>night.</mark1><br>
<br>
Smile O voluptuous cool-breath'd <mark1>earth!</mark1><br>
Earth of the slumbering and liquid <mark4>trees!</mark4><br>
Earth of departed sunset--earth of the mountains <mark5>misty-topt!</mark5><br>
<br>
Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with <mark3>blue!</mark3><br>
Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the <mark4>river!</mark4><br>
Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my <mark4>sake!</mark4><br>
Far-swooping elbow'd earth--rich apple-blossom'd <mark1>earth!</mark1><br>
<br>
Smile, for your lover <mark4>comes.</mark4><br>
Prodigal, you have given me love--therefore I to you give <mark1>love!</mark1><br>
O unspeakable passionate <mark1>love.</mark1><br>
<br>
You sea! I resign myself to you also--I guess what you <mark4>mean,</mark4><br>
I behold from the beach your crooked inviting <mark4>fingers,</mark4><br>
I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
<br>
We must have a turn together, I undress, hurry me out of sight of the <mark4>land,</mark4><br>
Cushion me soft, rock me in billowy <mark5>drowse,</mark5><br>
<br>
Dash me with amorous wet, I can repay <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
Sea of stretch'd <mark4>ground-swells,</mark4><br>
<br>
Sea breathing broad and convulsive <mark4>breaths,</mark4><br>
Sea of the brine of life and of unshovell'd yet always-ready <mark1>graves,</mark1><br>
Howler and scooper of storms, capricious and dainty <mark1>sea,</mark1><br>
<br>
I am integral with you, I too am of one phase and of all <mark4>phases.</mark4><br>
Partaker of influx and efflux I, extoller of hate and <mark4>conciliation,</mark4><br>
Extoller of amies and those that sleep in each others' <mark1>arms.</mark1><br>
I am he attesting <mark4>sympathy,</mark4><br>
(Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house that supports <mark1>them?)</mark1><br>
I am not the poet of goodness only, I do not decline to be the poet of wickedness <mark1>also.</mark1><br>
What blurt is this about virtue and about <mark4>vice?</mark4><br>
Evil propels me and reform of evil propels me, I stand <mark4>indifferent,</mark4><br>
<br>
My gait is no fault-finder's or rejecter's <mark4>gait,</mark4><br>
I moisten the roots of all that has <mark4>grown.</mark4><br>
<br>
Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging <mark4>pregnancy?</mark4><br>
Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work'd over and <mark4>rectified?</mark4><br>
I find one side a balance and the antipodal side a <mark4>balance,</mark4><br>
Soft doctrine as steady help as stable <mark4>doctrine,</mark4><br>
Thoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early <mark4>start.</mark4><br>
This minute that comes to me over the past <mark5>decillions,</mark5><br>
There is no better than it and <mark1>now.</mark1><br>
<br>
What behaved well in the past or behaves well to-day is not such a <mark4>wonder,</mark4><br>
The wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an <mark4>infidel.</mark4><br>
Endless unfolding of words of <mark4>ages!</mark4><br>
And mine a word of the modern, the word <mark4>En-Masse.</mark4><br>
A word of the faith that never <mark4>balks,</mark4><br>
<br>
Here or henceforward it is all the same to me, I accept Time <mark4>absolutely.</mark4><br>
It alone is without flaw, it alone rounds and completes <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
<br>
That mystic baffling wonder alone completes <mark1>all.</mark1><br>
I accept Reality and dare not question <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
<br>
Materialism first and last imbuing. <br>
<br>
Hurrah for positive science! long live exact <mark4>demonstration!</mark4><br>
Fetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of <mark4>lilac,</mark4><br>
This is the lexicographer, this the chemist, this made a grammar of the old <mark5>cartouches,</mark5><br>
These mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown <mark4>seas.</mark4><br>
<br>
This is the geologist, this works with the scalpel, and this is a <mark4>mathematician.</mark4><br>
Gentlemen, to you the first honors <mark4>always!</mark4><br>
<br>
Your facts are useful, and yet they are not my <mark4>dwelling,</mark4><br>
I but enter by them to an area of my <mark1>dwelling.</mark1><br>
Less the reminders of properties told my <mark4>words,</mark4><br>
<br>
And more the reminders they of life untold, and of freedom and <mark4>extrication,</mark4><br>
And make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor men and women fully equipt, <br>
<br>
And beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives and them that plot and <mark4>conspire.</mark4><br>
Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the <mark4>son,</mark4><br>
<br>
Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, <mark4>eating</mark4>, drinking and <mark4>breeding,</mark4><br>
No sentimentalist, no stander above men and women or apart from <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
No more modest than <mark5>immodest.</mark5><br>
<br>
Unscrew the locks from the <mark4>doors!</mark4><br>
Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs! <br>
<br>
Whoever degrades another degrades <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
And whatever is done or said returns at last to <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
<br>
Through me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the current and <mark4>index.</mark4><br>
I speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of <mark4>democracy,</mark4><br>
<br>
By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same <mark4>terms.</mark4><br>
Through me many long dumb <mark4>voices,</mark4><br>
Voices of the interminable generations of prisoners and <mark4>slaves,</mark4><br>
Voices of the diseas'd and despairing and of thieves and <mark4>dwarfs,</mark4><br>
Voices of cycles of preparation and <mark4>accretion,</mark4><br>
<br>
And of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of the <mark3>father-stuff,</mark3><br>
And of the rights of them the others are down <mark4>upon,</mark4><br>
Of the deform'd, trivial, flat, foolish, <mark4>despised,</mark4><br>
<br>
Fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of <mark4>dung.</mark4><br>
Through me forbidden <mark1>voices,</mark1><br>
Voices of sexes and lusts, voices veil'd and I remove the <mark4>veil,</mark4><br>
Voices indecent by me clarified and <mark5>transfigur'd.</mark5><br>
<br>
I do not press my fingers across my <mark4>mouth,</mark4><br>
I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and <mark1>heart,</mark1><br>
Copulation is no more rank to me than death <mark1>is.</mark1><br>
I believe in the flesh and the <mark4>appetites,</mark4><br>
Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a <mark4>miracle.</mark4><br>
<br>
Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touch'd <mark4>from,</mark4><br>
The scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than <mark4>prayer,</mark4><br>
<br>
This head more than churches, <mark4>bibles</mark4>, and all the <mark4>creeds.</mark4><br>
If I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of my own body, or any part of <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
<br>
Translucent mould of me it shall be <mark1>you!</mark1><br>
<br>
Shaded ledges and rests it shall be <mark1>you!</mark1><br>
Firm masculine colter it shall be <mark1>you!</mark1><br>
<br>
Whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be <mark1>you!</mark1><br>
You my rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my <mark1>life!</mark1><br>
Breast that presses against other breasts it shall be <mark1>you!</mark1><br>
My brain it shall be your occult <mark5>convolutions!</mark5><br>
Root of wash'd sweet-flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded duplicate eggs! it shall be <mark1>you!</mark1><br>
Mix'd tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be <mark1>you!</mark1><br>
Trickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be <mark1>you!</mark1><br>
Sun so generous it shall be <mark1>you!</mark1><br>
<br>
Vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be <mark1>you!</mark1><br>
You sweaty brooks and dews it shall be <mark1>you!</mark1><br>
Winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me it shall be <mark1>you!</mark1><br>
<br>
Broad muscular fields, branches of live oak, loving lounger in my winding paths, it shall be <mark1>you!</mark1><br>
Hands I have taken, face I have kiss'd, mortal I have ever touch'd, it shall be <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
I dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so <mark4>luscious,</mark4><br>
<br>
Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with <mark3>joy,</mark3><br>
I cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of my faintest <mark4>wish,</mark4><br>
<br>
Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the friendship I take <mark1>again.</mark1><br>
That I walk up my stoop, I pause to consider if it really <mark4>be,</mark4><br>
A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of <mark1>books.</mark1><br>
<br>
To behold the <mark4>day-break!</mark4><br>
The little light fades the immense and diaphanous <mark4>shadows,</mark4><br>
The air tastes good to my <mark3>palate.</mark3><br>
Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising freshly <mark4>exuding,</mark4><br>
Scooting obliquely high and <mark3>low.</mark3><br>
Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous <mark4>prongs,</mark4><br>
Seas of bright juice suffuse <mark4>heaven.</mark4><br>
The earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their <mark4>junction,</mark4><br>
The heav'd challenge from the east that moment over my <mark4>head,</mark4><br>
The mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be <mark4>master!</mark4><br>
Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
If I could not now and always send sun-rise out of <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the <mark1>sun,</mark1><br>
We found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the <mark2>daybreak.</mark2><br>
My voice goes after what my eyes cannot <mark4>reach,</mark4><br>
With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of <mark4>worlds.</mark4><br>
Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure <mark4>itself,</mark4><br>
<br>
It provokes me forever, it says <mark4>sarcastically,</mark4><br>
Walt you contain enough, why don't you let it out <mark4>then?</mark4><br>
Come now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of <mark4>articulation,</mark4><br>
Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are <mark4>folded?</mark4><br>
<br>
Waiting in gloom, protected by <mark4>frost,</mark4><br>
The dirt receding before my prophetical <mark4>screams,</mark4><br>
<br>
I underlying causes to balance them at <mark4>last,</mark4><br>
My knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the meaning of all <mark4>things,</mark4><br>
Happiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search of this <mark1>day.)</mark1><br>
<br>
My final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I really <mark1>am,</mark1><br>
Encompass worlds, but never try to encompass <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
<br>
I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
Writing and talk do not prove <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
<br>
I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my <mark1>face,</mark1><br>
With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the <mark4>skeptic.</mark4><br>
Now I will do nothing but <mark4>listen,</mark4><br>
<br>
To accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute toward <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of <mark4>flames</mark4>, clack of sticks cooking my <mark4>meals,</mark4><br>
I hear the sound I love, the sound of the human <mark1>voice,</mark1><br>
<br>
I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or <mark4>following,</mark4><br>
Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day and <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
<br>
Talkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh of work-people at their <mark1>meals,</mark1><br>
The angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the <mark4>sick,</mark4><br>
<br>
The judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing a <mark4>death-sentence,</mark4><br>
The heave'e'yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves, the refrain of the <mark4>anchor-lifters,</mark4><br>
The ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of swift-streaking engines and hose-carts with premonitory tinkles and color'd <mark4>lights,</mark4><br>
<br>
The steam whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching <mark4>cars,</mark4><br>
The slow march play'd at the head of the association marching two and <mark3>two,</mark3><br>
(They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with black <mark4>muslin.)</mark4><br>
I hear the violoncello, ('tis the young man's heart's <mark4>complaint,)</mark4><br>
I hear the key'd cornet, it glides quickly in through my <mark4>ears,</mark4><br>
It shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and <mark4>breast.</mark4><br>
I hear the chorus, it is a grand <mark4>opera,</mark4><br>
<br>
Ah this indeed is music--this suits <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me <mark4>full.</mark4><br>
<br>
I hear the train'd soprano (what work with hers is <mark4>this?)</mark4><br>
The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus <mark4>flies,</mark4><br>
It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess'd <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
<br>
It sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick'd by the indolent <mark4>waves,</mark4><br>
I am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my <mark1>breath,</mark1><br>
Steep'd amid honey'd morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of <mark1>death,</mark1><br>
<br>
At length let up again to feel the puzzle of <mark4>puzzles,</mark4><br>
And that we call <mark4>Being.</mark4><br>
To be in any form, what is <mark4>that?</mark4><br>
(Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back <mark5>thither,)</mark5><br>
If nothing lay more develop'd the quahaug in its callous shell were <mark1>enough.</mark1><br>
Mine is no callous <mark4>shell,</mark4><br>
I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or <mark4>stop,</mark4><br>
They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am <mark4>happy,</mark4><br>
To touch my person to some one else's is about as much as I can <mark1>stand.</mark1><br>
Is this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity, <br>
Flames and ether making a rush for my <mark4>veins,</mark4><br>
<br>
Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from <mark1>myself,</mark1><br>
On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my <mark1>limbs,</mark1><br>
<br>
Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld <mark4>drip,</mark4><br>
Behaving licentious toward me, taking no <mark4>denial,</mark4><br>
<br>
Depriving me of my best as for a <mark1>purpose,</mark1><br>
Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare <mark4>waist,</mark4><br>
<br>
Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and <mark4>pasture-fields,</mark4><br>
Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
They bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
No consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my <mark4>anger,</mark4><br>
Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a <mark4>while,</mark4><br>
Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
<br>
The sentries desert every other part of <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
They have left me helpless to a red <mark4>marauder,</mark4><br>
<br>
They all come to the headland to witness and assist against <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
I am given up by <mark4>traitors,</mark4><br>
I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the greatest <mark4>traitor,</mark4><br>
I went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me <mark1>there.</mark1><br>
<br>
You villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in its <mark1>throat,</mark1><br>
Unclench your floodgates, you are too much for <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
Blind loving wrestling <mark1>touch</mark1>, sheath'd hooded sharp-tooth'd <mark4>touch!</mark4><br>
<br>
Did it make you ache so, leaving <mark1>me?</mark1><br>
Parting track'd by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual <mark4>loan,</mark4><br>
<br>
Rich showering rain, and recompense richer <mark4>afterward.</mark4><br>
Sprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and <mark4>vital,</mark4><br>
Landscapes projected <mark4>masculine</mark4>, full-sized and <mark4>golden.</mark4><br>
All truths wait in all <mark1>things,</mark1><br>
They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
They do not need the obstetric forceps of the <mark4>surgeon,</mark4><br>
The insignificant is as big to me as <mark4>any,</mark4><br>
(What is less or more than a <mark1>touch?)</mark1><br>
Logic and sermons never <mark4>convince,</mark4><br>
The damp of the night drives deeper into my <mark1>soul.</mark1><br>
(Only what proves itself to every man and woman is <mark1>so,</mark1><br>
Only what nobody denies is <mark1>so.)</mark1><br>
A minute and a drop of me settle my <mark4>brain,</mark4><br>
I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and <mark4>lamps,</mark4><br>
And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or <mark4>woman,</mark4><br>
And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each <mark1>other,</mark1><br>
<br>
And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it becomes omnific, <br>
And until one and all shall delight us, and we <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the <mark1>stars,</mark1><br>
<br>
And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the <mark4>wren,</mark4><br>
And the tree-toad is a chef-d'oeuvre for the <mark4>highest,</mark4><br>
And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of <mark1>heaven,</mark1><br>
<br>
And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all <mark4>machinery,</mark4><br>
And the cow crunching with depress'd head surpasses any <mark5>statue,</mark5><br>
<br>
And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of <mark4>infidels.</mark4><br>
I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits, grains, esculent <mark4>roots,</mark4><br>
And am stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all <mark1>over,</mark1><br>
<br>
And have distanced what is behind me for good <mark4>reasons,</mark4><br>
But call any thing back again when I desire <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
<br>
In vain the speeding or <mark4>shyness,</mark4><br>
In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my <mark4>approach,</mark4><br>
<br>
In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder'd <mark1>bones,</mark1><br>
In vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold <mark4>shapes,</mark4><br>
In vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying <mark1>low,</mark1><br>
In vain the buzzard houses herself with the <mark1>sky,</mark1><br>
In vain the snake slides through the creepers and <mark1>logs,</mark1><br>
In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the <mark1>woods,</mark1><br>
<br>
In vain the razor-bill'd auk sails far north to <mark4>Labrador,</mark4><br>
I follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the <mark4>cliff.</mark4><br>
<br>
I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and <mark5>self-contain'd,</mark5><br>
I stand and look at them long and <mark4>long.</mark4><br>
<br>
They do not sweat and whine about their <mark4>condition,</mark4><br>
They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their <mark4>sins,</mark4><br>
They do not make me sick discussing their duty to <mark4>God,</mark4><br>
Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owning <mark1>things,</mark1><br>
Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years <mark3>ago,</mark3><br>
Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole <mark1>earth.</mark1><br>
<br>
So they show their relations to me and I accept <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
They bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their <mark4>possession.</mark4><br>
I wonder where they get those <mark4>tokens,</mark4><br>
Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop <mark1>them?</mark1><br>
Myself moving forward then and now and <mark1>forever,</mark1><br>
Gathering and showing more always and with <mark4>velocity,</mark4><br>
Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers, <br>
<br>
Picking out here one that I love, and now go with him on brotherly <mark1>terms.</mark1><br>
A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my <mark4>caresses,</mark4><br>
Head high in the forehead, wide between the <mark1>ears,</mark1><br>
Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the <mark1>ground,</mark1><br>
<br>
Eyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly <mark4>moving.</mark4><br>
His nostrils dilate as my heels embrace <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
His well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and <mark4>return.</mark4><br>
I but use you a minute, then I resign you, <mark4>stallion,</mark4><br>
Why do I need your paces when I myself out-gallop <mark1>them?</mark1><br>
Even as I stand or sit passing faster than <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
Space and Time! now I see it is true, what I guess'd <mark4>at,</mark4><br>
What I guess'd when I loaf'd on the <mark1>grass,</mark1><br>
What I guess'd while I lay alone in my <mark4>bed,</mark4><br>
And again as I walk'd the beach under the paling stars of the <mark1>morning.</mark1><br>
<br>
My ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in <mark4>sea-gaps,</mark4><br>
I skirt sierras, my palms cover <mark4>continents,</mark4><br>
I am afoot with my <mark4>vision.</mark4><br>
<br>
By the city's quadrangular houses--in log huts, camping with lumbermen, <br>
Along the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet <mark1>bed,</mark1><br>
Weeding my onion-patch or hoeing rows of carrots and parsnips, crossing savannas, trailing in <mark4>forests,</mark4><br>
Prospecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new <mark4>purchase,</mark4><br>
Scorch'd ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down the shallow <mark1>river,</mark1><br>
Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where the buck turns furiously at the <mark4>hunter,</mark4><br>
<br>
Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where the otter is feeding on <mark3>fish,</mark3><br>
Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou, <br>
<br>
Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped <mark4>tail;</mark4><br>
Over the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower'd cotton plant, over the rice in its low moist <mark4>field,</mark4><br>
<br>
Over the sharp-peak'd farm house, with its scallop'd scum and slender shoots from the <mark4>gutters,</mark4><br>
Over the western persimmon, over the long-leav'd corn, over the delicate blue-flower <mark4>flax,</mark4><br>
Over the white and brown <mark4>buckwheat</mark4>, a hummer and buzzer there with the <mark1>rest,</mark1><br>
Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the <mark4>breeze;</mark4><br>
Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low scragged <mark1>limbs,</mark1><br>
<br>
Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the <mark4>brush,</mark4><br>
Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the <mark4>wheat-lot,</mark4><br>
Where the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve, where the great gold-bug drops through the <mark4>dark,</mark4><br>
Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the <mark5>meadow,</mark5><br>
<br>
Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their <mark4>hides,</mark4><br>
Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons straddle the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons from the <mark4>rafters;</mark4><br>
<br>
Where trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its <mark4>cylinders,</mark4><br>
Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its <mark1>ribs,</mark1><br>
Where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it myself and looking composedly <mark4>down,)</mark4><br>
<br>
Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat hatches pale-green eggs in the dented <mark4>sand,</mark4><br>
Where the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of <mark4>smoke,</mark4><br>
Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the <mark4>water,</mark4><br>
Where the half-burn'd brig is riding on unknown <mark4>currents,</mark4><br>
<br>
Where shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are corrupting <mark3>below;</mark3><br>
Where the dense-starr'd flag is borne at the head of the <mark4>regiments,</mark4><br>
Approaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching <mark4>island,</mark4><br>
<br>
Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my <mark4>countenance,</mark4><br>
Upon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood <mark1>outside,</mark1><br>
Upon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of <mark4>base-ball,</mark4><br>
At he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license, bull-dances, drinking, <mark4>laughter,</mark4><br>
At the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking the juice through a <mark3>straw,</mark3><br>
At apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I <mark4>find,</mark4><br>
At musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, <mark5>house-raisings;</mark5><br>
Where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles, screams, <mark4>weeps,</mark4><br>
Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks are scatter'd, where the brood-cow waits in the <mark4>hovel,</mark4><br>
Where the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the stud to the mare, where the cock is treading the <mark4>hen,</mark4><br>
Where the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with short <mark4>jerks,</mark4><br>
Where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome <mark4>prairie,</mark4><br>
Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and <mark4>near,</mark4><br>
Where the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the long-lived swan is curving and <mark4>winding,</mark4><br>
Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her near-human <mark4>laugh,</mark4><br>
Where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the high <mark4>weeds,</mark4><br>
Where band-neck'd partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads <mark1>out,</mark1><br>
Where burial coaches enter the arch'd gates of a <mark4>cemetery,</mark4><br>
Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled <mark1>trees,</mark1><br>
Where the yellow-crown'd heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon small <mark4>crabs,</mark4><br>
Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm <mark4>noon,</mark4><br>
Where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over the <mark4>well,</mark4><br>
Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired <mark4>leaves,</mark4><br>
Through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical <mark4>firs,</mark4><br>
Through the gymnasium, through the curtain'd saloon, through the office or public <mark4>hall;</mark4><br>
Pleas'd with the native and pleas'd with the foreign, pleas'd with the new and <mark4>old,</mark4><br>
Pleas'd with the homely woman as well as the <mark4>handsome,</mark4><br>
Pleas'd with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks <mark5>melodiously,</mark5><br>
Pleas'd with the tune of the choir of the whitewash'd <mark4>church,</mark4><br>
Pleas'd with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher, impress'd seriously at the <mark4>camp-meeting;</mark4><br>
Looking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon, flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate <mark4>glass,</mark4><br>
Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn'd up to the clouds, or down a lane or along the <mark4>beach,</mark4><br>
My right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the <mark4>middle;</mark4><br>
Coming home with the silent and dark-cheek'd bush-boy, (behind me he rides at the drape of the <mark1>day,)</mark1><br>
Far from the settlements studying the print of animals' <mark4>feet</mark4>, or the moccasin <mark4>print,</mark4><br>
By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish <mark4>patient,</mark4><br>
Nigh the coffin'd corpse when all is <mark4>still</mark4>, examining with a <mark4>candle;</mark4><br>
Voyaging to every port to dicker and <mark4>adventure,</mark4><br>
Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as <mark1>any,</mark1><br>
Hot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long <mark1>while,</mark1><br>
Walking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God by my <mark1>side,</mark1><br>
Speeding through space, speeding through heaven and the <mark1>stars,</mark1><br>
Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the diameter of eighty thousand <mark4>miles,</mark4><br>
Speeding with tail'd meteors, throwing fire-balls like the <mark1>rest,</mark1><br>
Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its <mark4>belly,</mark4><br>
Storming, enjoying, planning, <mark4>loving</mark4>, <mark4>cautioning,</mark4><br>
Backing and <mark4>filling</mark4>, appearing and <mark4>disappearing,</mark4><br>
I tread day and night such <mark4>roads.</mark4><br>
I visit the orchards of spheres and look at the <mark4>product,</mark4><br>
And look at quintillions ripen'd and look at quintillions <mark4>green.</mark4><br>
I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing <mark1>soul,</mark1><br>
My course runs below the soundings of <mark4>plummets.</mark4><br>
I help myself to material and <mark4>immaterial,</mark4><br>
No guard can shut me off, no law prevent <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
I anchor my ship for a little while <mark4>only,</mark4><br>
My messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
I go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a pike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and <mark1>blue.</mark1><br>
I ascend to the <mark5>foretruck,</mark5><br>
I take my place late at night in the <mark4>crow's-nest,</mark4><br>
We sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light <mark1>enough,</mark1><br>
Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful <mark4>beauty,</mark4><br>
The enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the scenery is plain in all <mark4>directions,</mark4><br>
The white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out my fancies toward <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to be <mark4>engaged,</mark4><br>
We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still feet and <mark4>caution,</mark4><br>
Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin'd <mark4>city,</mark4><br>
The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the <mark1>globe.</mark1><br>
I am a free companion, I bivouac by invading <mark5>watchfires,</mark5><br>
I turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride <mark1>myself,</mark1><br>
I tighten her all night to my thighs and <mark1>lips.</mark1><br>
My voice is the wife's voice, the screech by the rail of the <mark4>stairs,</mark4><br>
They fetch my man's body up dripping and <mark4>drown'd.</mark4><br>
I understand the large hearts of <mark1>heroes,</mark1><br>
The courage of present times and all <mark4>times,</mark4><br>
How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steam-ship, and Death chasing it up and down the <mark4>storm,</mark4><br>
How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful of days and faithful of <mark4>nights,</mark4><br>
And chalk'd in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, we will not desert <mark1>you;</mark1><br>
How he follow'd with them and tack'd with them three days and would not give it <mark4>up,</mark4><br>
How he saved the drifting company at <mark1>last,</mark1><br>
How the lank loose-gown'd women look'd when boated from the side of their prepared <mark1>graves,</mark1><br>
<br>
How the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipp'd unshaved <mark1>men;</mark1><br>
All this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes <mark4>mine,</mark4><br>
<br>
I am the man, I suffer'd, I was <mark1>there.</mark1><br>
The disdain and calmness of <mark4>martyrs,</mark4><br>
<br>
The mother of old, condemn'd for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her children gazing <mark1>on,</mark1><br>
The hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence, blowing, cover'd with <mark4>sweat,</mark4><br>
<br>
The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the murderous buckshot and the <mark4>bullets,</mark4><br>
All these I feel or <mark1>am.</mark1><br>
<br>
I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the <mark4>dogs,</mark4><br>
<br>
Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the <mark4>marksmen,</mark4><br>
I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with the ooze of my <mark4>skin,</mark4><br>
I fall on the weeds and <mark4>stones,</mark4><br>
The riders spur their unwilling <mark4>horses</mark4>, haul <mark1>close,</mark1><br>
Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with <mark4>whip-stocks.</mark4><br>
Agonies are one of my changes of <mark4>garments,</mark4><br>
I do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself become the wounded <mark4>person,</mark4><br>
My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and <mark4>observe.</mark4><br>
I am the mash'd fireman with breast-bone <mark4>broken,</mark4><br>
Tumbling walls buried me in their <mark3>debris,</mark3><br>
<br>
Heat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my <mark4>comrades,</mark4><br>
I heard the distant click of their picks and <mark4>shovels,</mark4><br>
They have clear'd the beams away, they tenderly lift me <mark4>forth.</mark4><br>
<br>
I lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my <mark1>sake,</mark1><br>
Painless after all I lie exhausted but not so <mark4>unhappy,</mark4><br>
<br>
White and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared of their <mark4>fire-caps,</mark4><br>
The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the <mark4>torches.</mark4><br>
Distant and dead <mark4>resuscitate,</mark4><br>
They show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the clock <mark1>myself.</mark1><br>
I am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort's <mark4>bombardment,</mark4><br>
I am there <mark1>again.</mark1><br>
Again the long roll of the <mark4>drummers,</mark4><br>
Again the attacking cannon, <mark4>mortars,</mark4><br>
Again to my listening ears the cannon <mark4>responsive.</mark4><br>
I take part, I see and hear the <mark4>whole,</mark4><br>
The cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim'd <mark4>shots,</mark4><br>
<br>
The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red <mark1>drip,</mark1><br>
Workmen searching after <mark4>damages</mark4>, making indispensable <mark4>repairs,</mark4><br>
The fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped <mark4>explosion,</mark4><br>
The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the <mark1>air.</mark1><br>
Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves with his <mark1>hand,</mark1><br>
<br>
He gasps through the clot Mind not me--mind--the entrenchments. <br>
Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early <mark4>youth,</mark4><br>
(I tell not the fall of <mark4>Alamo,</mark4><br>
Not one escaped to tell the fall of <mark1>Alamo,</mark1><br>
The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at <mark1>Alamo,)</mark1><br>
'Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young <mark1>men.</mark1><br>
<br>
Retreating they had form'd in a hollow square with their baggage for <mark5>breastworks,</mark5><br>
Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy's, nine times their number, was the price they took in <mark4>advance,</mark4><br>
Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition <mark4>gone,</mark4><br>
<br>
They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv'd writing and seal, gave up their arms and march'd back prisoners of <mark4>war.</mark4><br>
They were the glory of the race of <mark4>rangers,</mark4><br>
Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, <mark4>courtship,</mark4><br>
Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and <mark4>affectionate,</mark4><br>
Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of <mark4>hunters,</mark4><br>
<br>
Not a single one over thirty years of <mark1>age.</mark1><br>
The second First-day morning they were brought out in squads and massacred, it was beautiful early <mark4>summer,</mark4><br>
The work commenced about five o'clock and was over by <mark4>eight.</mark4><br>
None obey'd the command to <mark4>kneel,</mark4><br>
<br>
Some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and <mark3>straight,</mark3><br>
A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead lay <mark4>together,</mark4><br>
<br>
The maim'd and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw them <mark1>there,</mark1><br>
Some half-kill'd attempted to crawl <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
<br>
These were despatch'd with bayonets or batter'd with the blunts of <mark5>muskets,</mark5><br>
A youth not seventeen years old seiz'd his assassin till two more came to release <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
The three were all torn and cover'd with the boy's <mark4>blood.</mark4><br>
<br>
At eleven o'clock began the burning of the <mark1>bodies;</mark1><br>
That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young <mark1>men.</mark1><br>
Would you hear of an old-time <mark4>sea-fight?</mark4><br>
Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and <mark1>stars?</mark1><br>
List to the yarn, as my grandmother's father the sailor told it to <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said <mark1>he,)</mark1><br>
<br>
His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer, and never was, and never will <mark1>be;</mark1><br>
Along the lower'd eve he came horribly raking <mark4>us.</mark4><br>
<br>
We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon <mark4>touch'd,</mark4><br>
My captain lash'd fast with his own <mark1>hands.</mark1><br>
We had receiv'd some eighteen pound shots under the <mark1>water,</mark1><br>
On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all around and blowing up <mark4>overhead.</mark4><br>
Fighting at sun-down, fighting at <mark1>dark,</mark1><br>
Ten o'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain, and five feet of water <mark4>reported,</mark4><br>
<br>
The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold to give them a chance for <mark4>themselves.</mark4><br>
The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the <mark4>sentinels,</mark4><br>
They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to <mark4>trust.</mark4><br>
Our frigate takes <mark1>fire,</mark1><br>
<br>
The other asks if we demand <mark4>quarter?</mark4><br>
If our colors are struck and the fighting <mark4>done?</mark4><br>
Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little <mark4>captain,</mark4><br>
We have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part of the <mark4>fighting.</mark4><br>
Only three guns are in <mark4>use,</mark4><br>
<br>
One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy's mainmast, <br>
Two well serv'd with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his <mark4>decks.</mark4><br>
<br>
The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the <mark4>main-top,</mark4><br>
They hold out bravely during the whole of the <mark4>action.</mark4><br>
Not a moment's <mark4>cease,</mark4><br>
The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the <mark4>powder-magazine.</mark4><br>
One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are <mark4>sinking.</mark4><br>
Serene stands the little <mark1>captain,</mark1><br>
He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor <mark1>low,</mark1><br>
His eyes give more light to us than our <mark4>battle-lanterns.</mark4><br>
<br>
Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to <mark1>us.</mark1><br>
Stretch'd and still lies the <mark4>midnight,</mark4><br>
<br>
Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the <mark4>darkness,</mark4><br>
Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the one we have <mark4>conquer'd,</mark4><br>
The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a <mark4>sheet,</mark4><br>
Near by the corpse of the child that serv'd in the <mark4>cabin,</mark4><br>
<br>
The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curl'd <mark4>whiskers,</mark4><br>
The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and <mark1>below,</mark1><br>
The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for <mark4>duty,</mark4><br>
<br>
Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh upon the masts and <mark5>spars,</mark5><br>
Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of <mark1>waves,</mark1><br>
<br>
Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong <mark4>scent,</mark4><br>
A few large stars overhead, silent and mournful <mark4>shining,</mark4><br>
<br>
Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore, death-messages given in charge to <mark4>survivors,</mark4><br>
The hiss of the surgeon's knife, the gnawing teeth of his <mark3>saw,</mark3><br>
Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long, dull, tapering <mark4>groan,</mark4><br>
<br>
These so, these irretrievable. <br>
You laggards there on guard! look to your <mark1>arms!</mark1><br>
<br>
In at the conquer'd doors they crowd! I am <mark4>possess'd!</mark4><br>
Embody all presences outlaw'd or <mark4>suffering,</mark4><br>
See myself in prison shaped like another <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
<br>
And feel the dull unintermitted <mark4>pain.</mark4><br>
For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep <mark4>watch,</mark4><br>
<br>
It is I let out in the morning and barr'd at <mark1>night.</mark1><br>
Not a mutineer walks handcuff'd to jail but I am handcuff'd to him and walk by his <mark1>side,</mark1><br>
(I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with sweat on my twitching <mark1>lips.)</mark1><br>
<br>
Not a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am tried and <mark4>sentenced.</mark4><br>
Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last <mark4>gasp,</mark4><br>
<br>
My face is ash-color'd, my sinews gnarl, away from me people <mark4>retreat.</mark4><br>
Askers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
<br>
I project my hat, sit shame-faced, and <mark4>beg.</mark4><br>
<br>
Enough! enough! <mark1>enough!</mark1><br>
Somehow I have been stunn'd. Stand <mark4>back!</mark4><br>
Give me a little time beyond my cuff'd head, slumbers, dreams, <mark4>gaping,</mark4><br>
<br>
I discover myself on the verge of a usual <mark4>mistake.</mark4><br>
<br>
That I could forget the mockers and <mark4>insults!</mark4><br>
That I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the bludgeons and <mark4>hammers!</mark4><br>
That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and bloody <mark4>crowning.</mark4><br>
I remember <mark1>now,</mark1><br>
I resume the overstaid <mark4>fraction,</mark4><br>
The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to any <mark1>graves,</mark1><br>
Corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
I troop forth replenish'd with supreme power, one of an average unending <mark4>procession,</mark4><br>
Inland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary <mark4>lines,</mark4><br>
Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole <mark1>earth,</mark1><br>
The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of <mark1>years.</mark1><br>
Eleves, I salute you! come <mark4>forward!</mark4><br>
Continue your <mark4>annotations</mark4>, continue your <mark4>questionings.</mark4><br>
The friendly and flowing savage, who is <mark1>he?</mark1><br>
Is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering <mark1>it?</mark1><br>
Is he some Southwesterner rais'd out-doors? is he Kanadian? <br>
Is he from the Mississippi country? Iowa, Oregon, <mark4>California?</mark4><br>
<br>
The mountains? prairie-life, bush-life? or sailor from the <mark1>sea?</mark1><br>
Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
They desire he should like <mark1>them</mark1>, touch them, speak to them, stay with <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
Behavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as grass, uncomb'd head, laughter, and <mark3>naivete,</mark3><br>
Slow-stepping feet, common <mark4>features</mark4>, common modes and <mark4>emanations,</mark4><br>
They descend in new forms from the tips of his <mark1>fingers,</mark1><br>
<br>
They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath, they fly out of the glance of his <mark1>eyes.</mark1><br>
Flaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask--lie <mark1>over!</mark1><br>
<br>
You light surfaces only, I force surfaces and depths <mark1>also.</mark1><br>
Earth! you seem to look for something at my <mark1>hands,</mark1><br>
<br>
Say, old <mark4>top-knot</mark4>, what do you <mark4>want?</mark4><br>
<br>
Man or woman, I might tell how I like you, but <mark4>cannot,</mark4><br>
And might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but <mark1>cannot,</mark1><br>
<br>
And might tell that pining I have, that pulse of my nights and <mark4>days.</mark4><br>
Behold, I do not give lectures or a little <mark4>charity,</mark4><br>
<br>
When I give I give <mark1>myself.</mark1><br>
You there, impotent, loose in the <mark4>knees,</mark4><br>
Open your scarf'd chops till I blow grit within <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
Spread your palms and lift the flaps of your <mark4>pockets,</mark4><br>
I am not to be denied, I compel, I have stores plenty and to <mark4>spare,</mark4><br>
<br>
And any thing I have I <mark3>bestow.</mark3><br>
I do not ask who you are, that is not important to <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
You can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
<br>
To cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I <mark4>lean,</mark4><br>
On his right cheek I put the family <mark4>kiss,</mark4><br>
And in my soul I swear I never will deny <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler <mark1>babes.</mark1><br>
<br>
(This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant <mark4>republics.)</mark4><br>
To any one dying, thither I speed and twist the knob of the <mark4>door.</mark4><br>
Turn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the <mark1>bed,</mark1><br>
Let the physician and the priest go <mark4>home.</mark4><br>
<br>
I seize the descending man and raise him with resistless <mark1>will,</mark1><br>
O despairer, here is my <mark1>neck,</mark1><br>
<br>
By God, you shall not go down! hang your whole weight upon <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
I dilate you with tremendous breath, I buoy you <mark1>up,</mark1><br>
Every room of the house do I fill with an arm'd <mark4>force,</mark4><br>
<br>
Lovers of me, bafflers of <mark1>graves.</mark1><br>
Sleep--I and they keep guard all <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
Not doubt, not decease shall dare to lay finger upon <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
<br>
I have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to <mark1>myself,</mark1><br>
And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is <mark1>so.</mark1><br>
<br>
I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their <mark4>backs,</mark4><br>
And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed <mark4>help.</mark4><br>
I heard what was said of the <mark4>universe,</mark4><br>
Heard it and heard it of several thousand <mark1>years;</mark1><br>
<br>
It is middling well as far as it goes--but is that <mark1>all?</mark1><br>
Magnifying and applying come <mark3>I,</mark3><br>
Outbidding at the start the old cautious <mark4>hucksters,</mark4><br>
<br>
Taking myself the exact dimensions of <mark4>Jehovah,</mark4><br>
Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his <mark4>son</mark4>, and Hercules his <mark4>grandson,</mark4><br>
<br>
Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, <mark4>Buddha,</mark4><br>
In my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the crucifix <mark4>engraved,</mark4><br>
With Odin and the hideous-faced Mexitli and every idol and <mark4>image,</mark4><br>
<br>
Taking them all for what they are worth and not a cent <mark3>more,</mark3><br>
Admitting they were alive and did the work of their <mark1>days,</mark1><br>
<br>
(They bore mites as for unfledg'd birds who have now to rise and fly and sing for <mark1>themselves,)</mark1><br>
Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself, bestowing them freely on each man and woman I <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
Discovering as much or more in a framer framing a <mark4>house,</mark4><br>
Putting higher claims for him there with his roll'd-up sleeves driving the mallet and <mark4>chisel,</mark4><br>
Not objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of smoke or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any <mark4>revelation,</mark4><br>
<br>
Lads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less to me than the gods of the antique <mark4>wars,</mark4><br>
Minding their voices peal through the crash of <mark4>destruction,</mark4><br>
<br>
Their brawny limbs passing safe over charr'd laths, their white foreheads whole and unhurt out of the <mark4>flames;</mark4><br>
By the mechanic's wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for every person <mark1>born,</mark1><br>
Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angels with shirts bagg'd out at their <mark4>waists,</mark4><br>
<br>
The snag-tooth'd hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
Selling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his brother and sit by him while he is tried for <mark4>forgery;</mark4><br>
<br>
What was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about me, and not filling the square rod <mark1>then,</mark1><br>
The bull and the bug never worshipp'd half <mark1>enough,</mark1><br>
Dung and dirt more admirable than was <mark4>dream'd,</mark4><br>
<br>
The supernatural of no account, myself waiting my time to be one of the <mark3>supremes,</mark3><br>
The day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good as the best, and be as <mark4>prodigious;</mark4><br>
By my life-lumps! becoming already a <mark4>creator,</mark4><br>
<br>
Putting myself here and now to the ambush'd womb of the <mark1>shadows.</mark1><br>
A call in the midst of the <mark1>crowd,</mark1><br>
My own voice, orotund sweeping and <mark4>final.</mark4><br>
<br>
Come my <mark1>children,</mark1><br>
Come my boys and girls, my women, household and <mark4>intimates,</mark4><br>
Now the performer launches his nerve, he has pass'd his prelude on the reeds <mark4>within.</mark4><br>
Easily written loose-finger'd chords--I feel the thrum of your climax and <mark1>close.</mark1><br>
<br>
My head slues round on my <mark1>neck,</mark1><br>
Music rolls, but not from the <mark4>organ,</mark4><br>
Folks are around me, but they are no household of <mark1>mine.</mark1><br>
<br>
Ever the hard unsunk <mark1>ground,</mark1><br>
Ever the eaters and drinkers, ever the upward and downward sun, ever the air and the ceaseless <mark4>tides,</mark4><br>
Ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, <mark4>real,</mark4><br>
<br>
Ever the old inexplicable query, ever that thorn'd thumb, that breath of itches and <mark4>thirsts,</mark4><br>
Ever the vexer's hoot! hoot! till we find where the sly one hides and bring him <mark1>forth,</mark1><br>
Ever love, ever the sobbing liquid of <mark1>life,</mark1><br>
Ever the bandage under the chin, ever the trestles of <mark1>death.</mark1><br>
Here and there with dimes on the eyes <mark4>walking,</mark4><br>
To feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally <mark5>spooning,</mark5><br>
Tickets buying, taking, <mark4>selling</mark4>, but in to the feast never once <mark4>going,</mark4><br>
Many sweating, ploughing, <mark4>thrashing</mark4>, and then the chaff for payment <mark4>receiving,</mark4><br>
A few idly <mark4>owning</mark4>, and they the wheat continually <mark4>claiming.</mark4><br>
This is the city and I am one of the <mark4>citizens,</mark4><br>
Whatever interests the rest interests me, politics, wars, markets, <mark4>newspapers</mark4>, <mark4>schools,</mark4><br>
The mayor and councils, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories, stocks, stores, real estate and personal <mark4>estate.</mark4><br>
The little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and tail'd <mark4>coats,</mark4><br>
I am aware who they are, (they are positively not worms or <mark4>fleas,)</mark4><br>
I acknowledge the duplicates of myself, the weakest and shallowest is deathless with <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
What I do and say the same waits for <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
Every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
I know perfectly well my own <mark4>egotism,</mark4><br>
Know my omnivorous lines and must not write any <mark1>less,</mark1><br>
And would fetch you whoever you are flush with <mark1>myself.</mark1><br>
Not words of routine this song of <mark1>mine,</mark1><br>
But abruptly to question, to leap beyond yet nearer <mark4>bring;</mark4><br>
This printed and bound book--but the printer and the printing-office <mark3>boy?</mark3><br>
The well-taken photographs--but your wife or friend close and solid in your <mark1>arms?</mark1><br>
The black ship mail'd with iron, her mighty guns in her turrets--but the pluck of the captain and <mark4>engineers?</mark4><br>
In the houses the dishes and fare and furniture--but the host and hostess, and the look out of their <mark1>eyes?</mark1><br>
The sky up there--yet here or next door, or across the <mark3>way?</mark3><br>
The saints and sages in history--but you <mark3>yourself?</mark3><br>
<br>
Sermons, creeds, theology--but the fathomless human <mark1>brain,</mark1><br>
And what is reason? and what is love? and what is <mark1>life?</mark1><br>
I do not despise you priests, all time, the world <mark1>over,</mark1><br>
<br>
My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of <mark4>faiths,</mark4><br>
Enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between ancient and <mark4>modern,</mark4><br>
Believing I shall come again upon the earth after five thousand <mark1>years,</mark1><br>
<br>
Waiting responses from oracles, honoring the gods, saluting the <mark1>sun,</mark1><br>
<br>
Making a fetich of the first rock or stump, powowing with sticks in the circle of obis, <br>
Helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the <mark4>idols,</mark4><br>
Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession, rapt and austere in the woods a gymnosophist, <br>
<br>
Drinking mead from the skull-cup, to Shastas and Vedas admirant, minding the <mark4>Koran,</mark4><br>
Walking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and knife, beating the serpent-skin <mark4>drum,</mark4><br>
Accepting the Gospels, accepting him that was crucified, knowing assuredly that he is <mark4>divine,</mark4><br>
To the mass kneeling or the puritan's prayer rising, or sitting patiently in a <mark3>pew,</mark3><br>
Ranting and frothing in my insane crisis, or waiting dead-like till my spirit arouses <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Looking forth on pavement and <mark1>land</mark1>, or outside of pavement and <mark1>land,</mark1><br>
Belonging to the winders of the circuit of <mark4>circuits.</mark4><br>
<br>
One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk like a man leaving charges before a <mark4>journey.</mark4><br>
Down-hearted doubters dull and <mark4>excluded,</mark4><br>
Frivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten'd, <mark5>atheistical,</mark5><br>
I know every one of you, I know the sea of torment, doubt, despair and unbelief. <br>
How the flukes <mark4>splash!</mark4><br>
<br>
How they contort rapid as lightning, with spasms and spouts of <mark1>blood!</mark1><br>
Be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers, <br>
I take my place among you as much as among <mark1>any,</mark1><br>
<br>
The past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the <mark1>same,</mark1><br>
And what is yet untried and afterward is for you, me, all, precisely the <mark1>same.</mark1><br>
I do not know what is untried and <mark1>afterward,</mark1><br>
But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient, and cannot <mark4>fail.</mark4><br>
Each who passes is consider'd, each who stops is consider'd, not a single one can it <mark1>fail.</mark1><br>
<br>
It cannot fail the young man who died and was <mark4>buried,</mark4><br>
Nor the young woman who died and was put by his <mark1>side,</mark1><br>
Nor the little child that peep'd in at the door, and then drew back and was never seen <mark1>again,</mark1><br>
<br>
Nor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it with bitterness worse than <mark4>gall,</mark4><br>
Nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad <mark4>disorder,</mark4><br>
Nor the numberless slaughter'd and wreck'd, nor the brutish koboo call'd the ordure of <mark4>humanity,</mark4><br>
Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip <mark4>in,</mark4><br>
Nor any thing in the <mark1>earth</mark1>, or down in the oldest graves of the <mark1>earth,</mark1><br>
Nor any thing in the myriads of spheres, nor the myriads of myriads that inhabit <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
Nor the present, nor the least wisp that is <mark1>known.</mark1><br>
It is time to explain myself--let us stand <mark1>up.</mark1><br>
What is known I strip <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
I launch all men and women forward with me into the <mark3>Unknown.</mark3><br>
<br>
The clock indicates the moment--but what does eternity <mark4>indicate?</mark4><br>
We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and <mark4>summers,</mark4><br>
There are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
Births have brought us richness and <mark4>variety,</mark4><br>
And other births will bring us richness and <mark1>variety.</mark1><br>
I do not call one greater and one <mark4>smaller,</mark4><br>
That which fills its period and place is equal to <mark1>any.</mark1><br>
Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my <mark4>brother</mark4>, my <mark4>sister?</mark4><br>
I am sorry for you, they are not murderous or jealous upon <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
All has been gentle with me, I keep no account with <mark5>lamentation,</mark5><br>
(What have I to do with <mark1>lamentation?)</mark1><br>
I am an acme of things accomplish'd, and I an encloser of things to <mark1>be.</mark1><br>
My feet strike an apex of the apices of the <mark1>stairs,</mark1><br>
On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the <mark4>steps,</mark4><br>
All below duly travel'd, and still I mount and <mark4>mount.</mark4><br>
Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
<br>
Afar down I see the huge first Nothing, I know I was even <mark1>there,</mark1><br>
<br>
I waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic <mark4>mist,</mark4><br>
And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid <mark4>carbon.</mark4><br>
Long I was hugg'd close--long and <mark1>long.</mark1><br>
<br>
Immense have been the preparations for <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Faithful and friendly the arms that have help'd <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
<br>
Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful <mark5>boatmen,</mark5><br>
For room to me stars kept aside in their own <mark4>rings,</mark4><br>
They sent influences to look after what was to hold <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
Before I was born out of my mother generations guided <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
<br>
My embryo has never been torpid, nothing could overlay <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
For it the nebula cohered to an <mark4>orb,</mark4><br>
<br>
The long slow strata piled to rest it <mark1>on,</mark1><br>
<br>
Vast vegetables gave it <mark4>sustenance,</mark4><br>
Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited it with <mark3>care.</mark3><br>
All forces have been steadily employ'd to complete and delight <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Now on this spot I stand with my robust <mark1>soul.</mark1><br>
O span of youth! ever-push'd <mark4>elasticity!</mark4><br>
O manhood, balanced, florid and <mark1>full.</mark1><br>
My lovers suffocate <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my <mark1>skin,</mark1><br>
Jostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to me at <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
Crying by day Ahoy! from the rocks of the river, swinging and chirping over my <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
<br>
Calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled <mark4>underbrush,</mark4><br>
Lighting on every moment of my <mark1>life,</mark1><br>
<br>
Bussing my body with soft balsamic <mark4>busses,</mark4><br>
Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be <mark1>mine.</mark1><br>
<br>
Old age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying <mark1>days!</mark1><br>
<br>
Every condition promulges not only <mark1>itself</mark1>, it promulges what grows after and out of <mark1>itself,</mark1><br>
And the dark hush promulges as much as <mark1>any.</mark1><br>
<br>
I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled <mark4>systems,</mark4><br>
And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the rim of the farther <mark1>systems.</mark1><br>
<br>
Wider and wider they spread, <mark1>expanding</mark1>, always <mark4>expanding,</mark4><br>
Outward and outward and forever <mark4>outward.</mark4><br>
<br>
My sun has his sun and round him obediently <mark4>wheels,</mark4><br>
He joins with his partners a group of superior <mark4>circuit,</mark4><br>
And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
There is no stoppage and never can be <mark4>stoppage,</mark4><br>
<br>
If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces, were this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would not avail in the long <mark4>run,</mark4><br>
<br>
We should surely bring up again where we now <mark1>stand,</mark1><br>
And surely go as much <mark1>farther</mark1>, and then farther and <mark4>farther.</mark4><br>
A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues, do not hazard the span or make it <mark4>impatient,</mark4><br>
<br>
They are but parts, any thing is but a <mark4>part.</mark4><br>
See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of <mark1>that,</mark1><br>
Count ever so much, there is limitless time around <mark1>that.</mark1><br>
My rendezvous is appointed, it is <mark4>certain,</mark4><br>
<br>
The Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect <mark1>terms,</mark1><br>
<br>
The great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine will be <mark1>there.</mark1><br>
I know I have the best of time and space, and was never measured and never will be <mark4>measured.</mark4><br>
<br>
I tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen <mark1>all!)</mark1><br>
My signs are a rain-proof coat, good <mark4>shoes</mark4>, and a staff cut from the <mark1>woods,</mark1><br>
No friend of mine takes his ease in my <mark3>chair,</mark3><br>
<br>
I have no chair, no church, no <mark4>philosophy,</mark4><br>
I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, <mark4>exchange,</mark4><br>
<br>
But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a <mark4>knoll,</mark4><br>
My left hand hooking you round the <mark1>waist,</mark1><br>
My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public <mark1>road.</mark1><br>
Not I, not any one else can travel that road for <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
<br>
You must travel it for <mark1>yourself.</mark1><br>
It is not far, it is within <mark1>reach,</mark1><br>
<br>
Perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not <mark1>know,</mark1><br>
Perhaps it is everywhere on water and on <mark1>land.</mark1><br>
Shoulder your duds dear son, and I will mine, and let us hasten <mark1>forth,</mark1><br>
<br>
Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we <mark3>go.</mark3><br>
If you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your hand on my <mark4>hip,</mark4><br>
And in due time you shall repay the same service to <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
For after we start we never lie by <mark1>again.</mark1><br>
This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look'd at the crowded <mark1>heaven,</mark1><br>
And I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them, shall we be fill'd and satisfied <mark1>then?</mark1><br>
And my spirit said No, we but level that lift to pass and continue <mark4>beyond.</mark4><br>
You are also asking me questions and I hear <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
<br>
I answer that I cannot answer, you must find out for <mark1>yourself.</mark1><br>
<br>
Sit a while dear <mark1>son,</mark1><br>
Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to <mark4>drink,</mark4><br>
<br>
But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes, I kiss you with a good-by kiss and open the gate for your egress <mark4>hence.</mark4><br>
Long enough have you dream'd contemptible <mark4>dreams,</mark4><br>
<br>
Now I wash the gum from your <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every moment of your <mark1>life.</mark1><br>
<br>
Long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the <mark1>shore,</mark1><br>
Now I will you to be a bold <mark4>swimmer,</mark4><br>
To jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me, shout, and laughingly dash with your <mark1>hair.</mark1><br>
<br>
I am the teacher of <mark4>athletes,</mark4><br>
He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my <mark1>own,</mark1><br>
He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the <mark4>teacher.</mark4><br>
The boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived power, but in his own <mark4>right,</mark4><br>
<br>
Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or <mark4>fear,</mark4><br>
Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his <mark4>steak,</mark4><br>
<br>
Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel <mark4>cuts,</mark4><br>
First-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull's eye, to sail a skiff, to sing a song or play on the <mark3>banjo,</mark3><br>
<br>
Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with small-pox over all <mark5>latherers,</mark5><br>
And those well-tann'd to those that keep out of the <mark1>sun.</mark1><br>
I teach straying from <mark1>me</mark1>, yet who can stray from <mark1>me?</mark1><br>
<br>
I follow you whoever you are from the present <mark4>hour,</mark4><br>
My words itch at your ears till you understand <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
<br>
I do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while I wait for a <mark4>boat,</mark4><br>
(It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the tongue of <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
Tied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be <mark4>loosen'd.)</mark4><br>
I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a <mark1>house,</mark1><br>
And I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to him or her who privately stays with me in the open <mark1>air.</mark1><br>
If you would understand me go to the heights or <mark4>water-shore,</mark4><br>
The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of waves a <mark3>key,</mark3><br>
The maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my <mark1>words.</mark1><br>
<br>
No shutter'd room or school can commune with <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
But roughs and little children better than <mark1>they.</mark1><br>
<br>
The young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me <mark1>well,</mark1><br>
The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with him all <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
The farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my <mark1>voice,</mark1><br>
<br>
In vessels that sail my words sail, I go with fishermen and seamen and love <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
The soldier camp'd or upon the march is <mark1>mine,</mark1><br>
<br>
On the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and I do not fail <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
On that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know me seek <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
My face rubs to the hunter's face when he lies down alone in his <mark4>blanket,</mark4><br>
<br>
The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his <mark1>wagon,</mark1><br>
The young mother and old mother comprehend <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they <mark4>are,</mark4><br>
<br>
They and all would resume what I have told <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
I have said that the soul is not more than the <mark4>body,</mark4><br>
<br>
And I have said that the body is not more than the <mark1>soul,</mark1><br>
And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's self <mark1>is,</mark1><br>
And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral drest in his <mark4>shroud,</mark4><br>
<br>
And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the <mark1>earth,</mark1><br>
And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the learning of all <mark1>times,</mark1><br>
And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a <mark4>hero,</mark4><br>
<br>
And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel'd <mark1>universe,</mark1><br>
And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool and composed before a million <mark4>universes.</mark4><br>
And I say to <mark4>mankind</mark4>, Be not curious about <mark1>God,</mark1><br>
<br>
For I who am curious about each am not curious about <mark1>God,</mark1><br>
(No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and about <mark1>death.)</mark1><br>
I hear and behold God in every <mark4>object</mark4>, yet understand God not in the <mark4>least,</mark4><br>
Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than <mark1>myself.</mark1><br>
<br>
Why should I wish to see God better than this <mark1>day?</mark1><br>
I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment <mark1>then,</mark1><br>
In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the <mark1>glass,</mark1><br>
I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is sign'd by God's <mark4>name,</mark4><br>
And I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe'er I <mark1>go,</mark1><br>
Others will punctually come for ever and <mark3>ever.</mark3><br>
And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to try to alarm <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
<br>
To his work without flinching the accoucheur <mark1>comes,</mark1><br>
I see the elder-hand pressing receiving <mark4>supporting,</mark4><br>
I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible <mark1>doors,</mark1><br>
<br>
And mark the outlet, and mark the relief and <mark4>escape.</mark4><br>
And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure, but that does not offend <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
I smell the white roses sweet-scented and <mark4>growing,</mark4><br>
<br>
I reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish'd breasts of <mark4>melons.</mark4><br>
And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many <mark4>deaths,</mark4><br>
<br>
(No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times <mark4>before.)</mark4><br>
I hear you whispering there O stars of <mark1>heaven,</mark1><br>
O suns--O grass of graves--O perpetual transfers and <mark4>promotions,</mark4><br>
<br>
If you do not say any thing how can I say any <mark4>thing?</mark4><br>
Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn <mark4>forest,</mark4><br>
<br>
Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing <mark4>twilight,</mark4><br>
Toss, sparkles of day and dusk--toss on the black stems that decay in the <mark4>muck,</mark4><br>
Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry <mark1>limbs.</mark1><br>
I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
<br>
I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams <mark4>reflected,</mark4><br>
And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or <mark4>small.</mark4><br>
There is that in me--I do not know what it is--but I know it is in <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
<br>
Wrench'd and sweaty--calm and cool then my body <mark4>becomes,</mark4><br>
I sleep--I sleep <mark1>long.</mark1><br>
I do not know it--it is without name--it is a word <mark4>unsaid,</mark4><br>
It is not in any dictionary, utterance, <mark4>symbol.</mark4><br>
Something it swings on more than the earth I swing <mark1>on,</mark1><br>
<br>
To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers and <mark4>sisters.</mark4><br>
Do you see O my brothers and <mark1>sisters?</mark1><br>
It is not chaos or death--it is form, union, plan--it is eternal life--it is <mark4>Happiness.</mark4><br>
The past and present wilt--I have fill'd <mark1>them</mark1>, emptied <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
And proceed to fill my next fold of the <mark4>future.</mark4><br>
Listener up there! what have you to confide to <mark1>me?</mark1><br>
Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of <mark4>evening,</mark4><br>
(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute <mark4>longer.)</mark4><br>
Do I contradict <mark1>myself?</mark1><br>
<br>
Very well then I contradict <mark1>myself,</mark1><br>
(I am large, I contain <mark4>multitudes.)</mark4><br>
I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the <mark4>door-slab.</mark4><br>
<br>
Who has done his day's work? who will soonest be through with his <mark4>supper?</mark4><br>
Who wishes to walk with <mark1>me?</mark1><br>
<br>
Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too <mark4>late?</mark4><br>
The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains of my gab and my <mark4>loitering.</mark4><br>
I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable, <br>
I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the <mark1>world.</mark1><br>
The last scud of day holds back for <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow'd <mark4>wilds,</mark4><br>
<br>
It coaxes me to the vapor and the <mark4>dusk.</mark4><br>
I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway <mark1>sun,</mark1><br>
<br>
I effuse my flesh in <mark4>eddies</mark4>, and drift it in lacy <mark4>jags.</mark4><br>
I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I <mark1>love,</mark1><br>
If you want me again look for me under your <mark4>boot-soles.</mark4><br>
You will hardly know who I am or what I <mark1>mean,</mark1><br>
<br>
But I shall be good health to you <mark4>nevertheless,</mark4><br>
And filter and fibre your <mark1>blood.</mark1><br>
Failing to fetch me at first keep <mark4>encouraged,</mark4><br>
<br>
Missing me one place search <mark4>another,</mark4><br>
I stop somewhere waiting for <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
