Title : Part for the Whole<br>
Author : Robert Francis<br><br>

When others run to windows or out of <mark4>doors</mark4><br>
To catch the sunset whole, he is <mark4>content</mark4><br>
With any segment anywhere he <mark4>sits.</mark4><br>
<br>
From segment, <mark4>fragment</mark4>, he can <mark4>reconstruct</mark4><br>
The <mark1>whole</mark1>, prefers to reconstruct the <mark1>whole,</mark1><br>
As if to say, I see more seeing <mark4>less.</mark4><br>
<br>
A window to the east will serve as <mark4>well</mark4><br>
As window to the west, for eastern sky<br>
Echoes the western sky. And even <mark1>less--</mark1><br>
<br>
A patch of light that picture-glass <mark4>happens</mark4><br>
To catch from window-glass, fragment of <mark4>fragment,</mark4><br>
Flawed, distorted, dulled, <mark3>nevertheless</mark3><br>
<br>
Gives something unglassed nature cannot give:<br>
The old obliquity of art, and <mark4>proves</mark4><br>
Part may be more than whole, least may be <mark4>best.</mark4><br>
