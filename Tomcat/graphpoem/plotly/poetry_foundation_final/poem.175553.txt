Title : X Mon. December [1744] hath xxxi days. <br>
Author : Benjamin Franklin <br><br>

This World's an Inn, all Travellers are <mark3>we;</mark3><br>
And this World's Goods th'Accommodations <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
Our Life is nothing but a Winter's <mark3>Day;</mark3><br>
Some only break their Fast, and so <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
Others stay Dinner, and depart full <mark3>fed.</mark3><br>
The deepest Age but sups and goes to <mark3>bed.</mark3><br>
He's most in Debt that lingers out the <mark1>Day;</mark1><br>
Who dies betimes has less and less to <mark3>pay.</mark3><br>
