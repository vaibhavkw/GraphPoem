Title : The Arrow and the Song <br>
Author : Henry Wadsworth Longfellow <br><br>

I shot an arrow into the <mark3>air,</mark3><br>
It fell to earth, I knew not <mark3>where;</mark3><br>
For, so swiftly it flew, the <mark3>sight</mark3><br>
Could not follow it in its <mark3>flight.</mark3><br>
<br>
I breathed a song into the <mark1>air,</mark1><br>
It fell to earth, I knew not <mark1>where;</mark1><br>
For who has sight so keen and <mark3>strong,</mark3><br>
That it can follow the flight of <mark3>song?</mark3><br>
<br>
Long, long afterward, in an oak <br>
I found the arrow, still unbroke; <br>
And the song, from beginning to <mark3>end,</mark3><br>
I found again in the heart of a <mark3>friend.</mark3><br>
