Title : The Lady of Shalott (1832) <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

Part <mark3>I</mark3><br>
On either side the river <mark3>lie</mark3><br>
Long fields of barley and of <mark3>rye,</mark3><br>
That clothe the wold and meet the <mark3>sky;</mark3><br>
And thro' the field the road runs <mark3>by</mark3><br>
To many-tower'd <mark1>Camelot;</mark1><br>
The yellow-leaved <mark5>waterlily</mark5><br>
The green-sheathed daffodilly <br>
Tremble in the water <mark4>chilly</mark4><br>
Round about <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
Willows whiten, aspens <mark3>shiver.</mark3><br>
The sunbeam showers break and <mark3>quiver</mark3><br>
In the stream that runneth <mark4>ever</mark4><br>
By the island in the <mark4>river</mark4><br>
Flowing down to <mark1>Camelot.</mark1><br>
Four gray <mark4>walls</mark4>, and four gray <mark4>towers</mark4><br>
Overlook a space of <mark3>flowers,</mark3><br>
And the silent isle imbowers <br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
Underneath the bearded <mark4>barley,</mark4><br>
The reaper, reaping late and <mark4>early,</mark4><br>
Hears her ever chanting cheerly, <br>
Like an angel, singing <mark4>clearly,</mark4><br>
O'er the stream of <mark1>Camelot.</mark1><br>
Piling the sheaves in furrows <mark4>airy,</mark4><br>
Beneath the moon, the reaper <mark4>weary</mark4><br>
Listening whispers, ' 'Tis the <mark4>fairy,</mark4><br>
Lady of <mark1>Shalott.'</mark1><br>
<br>
The little isle is all inrail'd <br>
With a rose-fence, and <mark5>overtrail'd</mark5><br>
With roses: by the marge unhail'd <br>
The shallop flitteth silken <mark4>sail'd,</mark4><br>
Skimming down to <mark1>Camelot.</mark1><br>
A pearl garland winds her <mark3>head:</mark3><br>
She leaneth on a velvet <mark3>bed,</mark3><br>
Full royally apparelled, <br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
Part II <br>
No time hath she to sport and <mark3>play:</mark3><br>
A charmed web she weaves alway. <br>
A curse is on her, if she <mark3>stay</mark3><br>
Her weaving, either night or <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
To look down to <mark1>Camelot.</mark1><br>
She knows not what the curse may <mark4>be;</mark4><br>
Therefore she weaveth <mark4>steadily,</mark4><br>
Therefore no other care hath <mark3>she,</mark3><br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
She lives with little joy or <mark3>fear.</mark3><br>
Over the water, running <mark3>near,</mark3><br>
The sheepbell tinkles in her <mark3>ear.</mark3><br>
Before her hangs a mirror <mark3>clear,</mark3><br>
Reflecting tower'd <mark1>Camelot.</mark1><br>
And as the mazy web she <mark5>whirls,</mark5><br>
She sees the surly village churls, <br>
And the red cloaks of market <mark4>girls</mark4><br>
Pass onward from <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
Sometimes a troop of damsels <mark4>glad,</mark4><br>
An abbot on an ambling <mark3>pad,</mark3><br>
Sometimes a curly shepherd <mark3>lad,</mark3><br>
Or long-hair'd page in crimson <mark3>clad,</mark3><br>
Goes by to tower'd <mark1>Camelot:</mark1><br>
And sometimes thro' the mirror <mark3>blue</mark3><br>
The knights come riding two and <mark3>two:</mark3><br>
She hath no loyal knight and <mark3>true,</mark3><br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
But in her web she still <mark3>delights</mark3><br>
To weave the mirror's magic <mark3>sights,</mark3><br>
For often thro' the silent <mark3>nights</mark3><br>
A funeral, with plumes and <mark3>lights</mark3><br>
And music, came from <mark1>Camelot:</mark1><br>
Or when the moon was <mark4>overhead</mark4><br>
Came two young lovers lately <mark3>wed;</mark3><br>
I am half sick of shadows,' <mark3>said</mark3><br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
Part III <br>
A bow-shot from her <mark4>bower-eaves,</mark4><br>
He rode between the <mark3>barley-sheaves,</mark3><br>
The sun came dazzling thro' the <mark3>leaves,</mark3><br>
And flam'd upon the brazen <mark3>greaves</mark3><br>
Of bold Sir <mark3>Lancelot.</mark3><br>
A red-cross knight for ever <mark4>kneel'd</mark4><br>
To a lady in his <mark4>shield,</mark4><br>
That sparkled on the yellow <mark3>field,</mark3><br>
Beside remote <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
The gemmy bridle glitter'd <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
Like to some branch of stars we <mark3>see</mark3><br>
Hung in the golden <mark4>Galaxy.</mark4><br>
The bridle bells rang <mark4>merrily</mark4><br>
As he rode down from <mark1>Camelot:</mark1><br>
And from his blazon'd baldric <mark3>slung</mark3><br>
A mighty silver bugle <mark3>hung,</mark3><br>
And as he rode his armour <mark3>rung,</mark3><br>
Beside remote <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
All in the blue unclouded <mark4>weather</mark4><br>
Thick-jewell'd shone the <mark3>saddle-leather,</mark3><br>
The helmet and the <mark3>helmet-feather</mark3><br>
Burn'd like one burning flame <mark3>together,</mark3><br>
As he rode down from <mark1>Camelot.</mark1><br>
As often thro' the purple <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
Below the starry clusters <mark3>bright,</mark3><br>
Some bearded meteor, trailing <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
Moves over green <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
His broad clear brow in sunlight <mark4>glow'd;</mark4><br>
On burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode; <br>
From underneath his helmet <mark3>flow'd</mark3><br>
His coal-black curls as on he <mark4>rode,</mark4><br>
As he rode down from <mark1>Camelot.</mark1><br>
From the bank and from the <mark1>river</mark1><br>
He flash'd into the crystal <mark4>mirror,</mark4><br>
'Tirra <mark1>lirra</mark1>, tirra <mark1>lirra:'</mark1><br>
Sang Sir <mark1>Lancelot.</mark1><br>
<br>
She left the web, she left the <mark3>loom</mark3><br>
She made three paces thro' the <mark3>room</mark3><br>
She saw the water-flower <mark3>bloom,</mark3><br>
She saw the helmet and the <mark3>plume,</mark3><br>
She look'd down to <mark1>Camelot.</mark1><br>
Out flew the web and floated <mark4>wide;</mark4><br>
The mirror crack'd from side to <mark3>side;</mark3><br>
'The curse is come upon me,' <mark3>cried</mark3><br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
Part IV <br>
In the stormy east-wind <mark4>straining,</mark4><br>
The pale yellow woods were <mark3>waning,</mark3><br>
The broad stream in his banks <mark3>complaining,</mark3><br>
Heavily the low sky <mark3>raining</mark3><br>
Over tower'd <mark1>Camelot;</mark1><br>
Outside the isle a shallow <mark4>boat</mark4><br>
Beneath a willow lay <mark3>afloat,</mark3><br>
Below the carven stern she <mark3>wrote,</mark3><br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
A cloudwhite crown of pearl she dight, <br>
All raimented in snowy <mark4>white</mark4><br>
That loosely flew (her zone in <mark3>sight</mark3><br>
Clasp'd with one blinding diamond <mark1>bright)</mark1><br>
Her wide eyes fix'd on <mark1>Camelot,</mark1><br>
Though the squally east-wind <mark4>keenly</mark4><br>
Blew, with folded arms <mark3>serenely</mark3><br>
By the water stood the queenly <br>
Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
With a steady stony <mark4>glance--</mark4><br>
Like some bold seer in a <mark3>trance,</mark3><br>
Beholding all his own mischance, <br>
Mute, with a glassy <mark4>countenance--</mark4><br>
She look'd down to <mark1>Camelot.</mark1><br>
It was the closing of the <mark1>day:</mark1><br>
She loos'd the chain, and down she <mark3>lay;</mark3><br>
The broad stream bore her far <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
As when to sailors while they <mark4>roam,</mark4><br>
By creeks and outfalls far from <mark3>home,</mark3><br>
Rising and dropping with the <mark3>foam,</mark3><br>
From dying swans wild warblings <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
Blown shoreward; so to <mark1>Camelot</mark1><br>
Still as the boathead wound <mark4>along</mark4><br>
The willowy hills and fields <mark4>among,</mark4><br>
They heard her chanting her deathsong, <br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
A longdrawn carol, mournful, <mark4>holy,</mark4><br>
She chanted <mark4>loudly</mark4>, chanted <mark3>lowly,</mark3><br>
Till her eyes were darken'd <mark3>wholly,</mark3><br>
And her smooth face sharpen'd <mark3>slowly,</mark3><br>
Turn'd to tower'd <mark1>Camelot:</mark1><br>
For ere she reach'd upon the <mark3>tide</mark3><br>
The first house by the <mark3>water-side,</mark3><br>
Singing in her song she <mark3>died,</mark3><br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
Under tower and <mark4>balcony,</mark4><br>
By garden wall and <mark4>gallery,</mark4><br>
A pale, pale corpse she floated <mark1>by,</mark1><br>
Deadcold, between the houses <mark3>high,</mark3><br>
Dead into tower'd <mark1>Camelot.</mark1><br>
Knight and burgher, lord and <mark4>dame,</mark4><br>
To the planked wharfage <mark3>came:</mark3><br>
Below the stern they read her <mark3>name,</mark3><br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.</mark1><br>
<br>
They cross'd themselves, their stars they <mark4>blest,</mark4><br>
Knight, minstrel, abbot, squire, and <mark3>guest.</mark3><br>
There lay a parchment on her <mark3>breast,</mark3><br>
That puzzled more than all the <mark3>rest,</mark3><br>
The wellfed wits at <mark1>Camelot.</mark1><br>
'The web was woven <mark4>curiously,</mark4><br>
The charm is broken <mark4>utterly,</mark4><br>
Draw near and fear not,--this is <mark1>I,</mark1><br>
The Lady of <mark1>Shalott.'</mark1><br>
