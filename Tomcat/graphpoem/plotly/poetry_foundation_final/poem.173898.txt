Title : The Fire of Drift-wood <br>
Author : Henry Wadsworth Longfellow <br><br>

DEVEREUX FARM, NEAR <mark4>MARBLEHEAD.</mark4><br>
We sat within the farm-house <mark4>old,</mark4><br>
Whose windows, looking o'er the <mark3>bay,</mark3><br>
Gave to the sea-breeze damp and <mark3>cold,</mark3><br>
An easy entrance, night and <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
<br>
Not far away we saw the <mark3>port,</mark3><br>
The strange, old-fashioned, silent <mark3>town,</mark3><br>
The lighthouse, the dismantled <mark3>fort,</mark3><br>
The wooden houses, quaint and <mark3>brown.</mark3><br>
<br>
We sat and talked until the <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
Descending, filled the little <mark3>room;</mark3><br>
Our faces faded from the <mark3>sight,</mark3><br>
Our voices only broke the <mark3>gloom.</mark3><br>
<br>
We spake of many a vanished <mark4>scene,</mark4><br>
Of what we once had thought and <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
Of what had <mark1>been</mark1>, and might have <mark4>been,</mark4><br>
And who was <mark4>changed</mark4>, and who was <mark3>dead;</mark3><br>
<br>
And all that fills the hearts of <mark3>friends,</mark3><br>
When first they feel, with secret <mark4>pain,</mark4><br>
Their lives thenceforth have separate <mark3>ends,</mark3><br>
And never can be one <mark3>again;</mark3><br>
<br>
The first slight swerving of the <mark4>heart,</mark4><br>
That words are powerless to <mark3>express,</mark3><br>
And leave it still unsaid in <mark3>part,</mark3><br>
Or say it in too great <mark3>excess.</mark3><br>
<br>
The very tones in which we <mark4>spake</mark4><br>
Had something strange, I could but <mark4>mark;</mark4><br>
The leaves of memory seemed to <mark4>make</mark4><br>
A mournful rustling in the <mark4>dark.</mark4><br>
<br>
Oft died the words upon our <mark4>lips,</mark4><br>
As suddenly, from out the <mark3>fire</mark3><br>
Built of the wreck of stranded <mark3>ships,</mark3><br>
The flames would leap and then <mark3>expire.</mark3><br>
<br>
<mark4>And</mark4>, as their splendor flashed and <mark4>failed,</mark4><br>
We thought of wrecks upon the <mark3>main,</mark3><br>
Of ships dismasted, that were <mark3>hailed</mark3><br>
And sent no answer back <mark1>again.</mark1><br>
<br>
The <mark4>windows</mark4>, rattling in their <mark4>frames,</mark4><br>
The ocean, roaring up the <mark3>beach,</mark3><br>
The gusty blast, the bickering <mark3>flames,</mark3><br>
All mingled vaguely in our <mark3>speech;</mark3><br>
<br>
Until they made themselves a <mark1>part</mark1><br>
Of fancies floating through the <mark3>brain,</mark3><br>
The long-lost ventures of the <mark1>heart,</mark1><br>
That send no answers back <mark1>again.</mark1><br>
<br>
O flames that glowed! O hearts that <mark4>yearned!</mark4><br>
They were indeed too much <mark4>akin,</mark4><br>
The drift-wood fire without that <mark3>burned,</mark3><br>
The thoughts that burned and glowed <mark3>within.</mark3><br>
