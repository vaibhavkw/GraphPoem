Title : Obermann Once More <br>
Author : Matthew Arnold <br><br>

Savez-vous quelque bien qui console <mark3>du</mark3><br>
regret d'un monde??OBERMANN.<br>
Glion??Ah, twenty years, it <mark3>cuts</mark3><br>
All meaning from a <mark3>name!</mark3><br>
White houses prank where once were <mark3>huts.</mark3><br>
Glion, but not the <mark3>same!</mark3><br>
<br>
And yet I know not! All <mark3>unchanged</mark3><br>
The turf, the pines, the <mark3>sky!</mark3><br>
The hills in their old order <mark3>ranged;</mark3><br>
The lake, with Chillon <mark3>by!</mark3><br>
<br>
And, 'neath those chestnut-trees, where <mark3>stiff</mark3><br>
And stony mounts the <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
The crackling husk-heaps burn, as <mark3>if</mark3><br>
I left them <mark3>yesterday!</mark3><br>
<br>
Across the valley, on that <mark5>slope,</mark5><br>
The huts of Avant <mark4>shine!</mark4><br>
lts pines, under their branches, ope<br>
Ways for the pasturing kine.<br>
<br>
Full-foaming milk-pails, Alpine <mark3>fare,</mark3><br>
Sweet heaps of fresh-cut <mark4>grass,</mark4><br>
Invite to rest the traveller <mark3>there</mark3><br>
Before he climb the <mark3>pass?</mark3><br>
<br>
The gentian-flower'd pass, its <mark4>crown</mark4><br>
With yellow spires <mark3>aflame;</mark3><br>
Whence drops the path to Alliere <mark3>down,</mark3><br>
And walls where Byron <mark3>came,</mark3><br>
<br>
By their green river, who doth <mark3>change</mark3><br>
His birth-name just <mark3>below;</mark3><br>
Orchard, and croft, and full-stored <mark3>grange</mark3><br>
Nursed by his pastoral <mark3>flow.</mark3><br>
<br>
But stop!?to fetch back thoughts that <mark3>stray</mark3><br>
Beyond this gracious <mark4>bound,</mark4><br>
The cone of Jaman, pale and <mark3>gray,</mark3><br>
See, in the blue <mark3>profound!</mark3><br>
<br>
Ah, Jaman! delicately <mark3>tall</mark3><br>
Above his sun-warm'd <mark3>firs?</mark3><br>
What thoughts to me his rocks <mark3>recall,</mark3><br>
What memories he <mark3>stirs!</mark3><br>
<br>
And who but thou must be, in <mark3>truth,</mark3><br>
Obermann! with me <mark4>here?</mark4><br>
Thou master of my wandering <mark3>youth,</mark3><br>
But left this many a <mark4>year!</mark4><br>
<br>
Yes, I forget the world's work <mark3>wrought,</mark3><br>
Its warfare waged with <mark4>pain;</mark4><br>
An eremite with thee, in <mark3>thought</mark3><br>
Once more I slip my <mark3>chain,</mark3><br>
<br>
And to thy mountain-chalet <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
And lie beside its <mark4>door,</mark4><br>
And hear the wild bee's Alpine <mark3>hum,</mark3><br>
And thy sad, tranquil <mark3>lore!</mark3><br>
<br>
Again I feel the words <mark4>inspire</mark4><br>
Their mournful calm; <mark4>serene,</mark4><br>
Yet tinged with infinite <mark3>desire</mark3><br>
For all that might have <mark4>been?</mark4><br>
<br>
The harmony from which man <mark4>swerved</mark4><br>
Made his life's rule once <mark4>more!</mark4><br>
The universal order <mark3>served,</mark3><br>
Earth happier than <mark3>before!</mark3><br>
<br>
?While thus I mused, night gently <mark4>ran</mark4><br>
Down over hill and <mark4>wood.</mark4><br>
Then, still and sudden, <mark5>Obermann</mark5><br>
On the grass near me <mark3>stood.</mark3><br>
<br>
Those pensive features well I <mark3>knew,</mark3><br>
On my mind, years <mark1>before,</mark1><br>
Imaged so oft! imaged so <mark3>true!</mark3><br>
?A shepherd's garb he <mark3>wore,</mark3><br>
<br>
A mountain-flower was in his <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
A book was in his <mark4>breast.</mark4><br>
Bent on my face, with gaze which <mark5>scann'd</mark5><br>
My soul, his eyes did <mark3>rest.</mark3><br>
<br>
"And is it thou," he cried, "so <mark3>long</mark3><br>
Held by the world which <mark3>we</mark3><br>
Loved not, who turnest from the <mark3>throng</mark3><br>
Back to thy youth and <mark3>me?</mark3><br>
<br>
   "And from thy world, with heart opprest,<br>
Choosest thou now to <mark4>turn??</mark4><br>
Ah me! we anchorites read things <mark3>best,</mark3><br>
Clearest their course <mark3>discern!</mark3><br>
<br>
"Thou fledst me when the ungenial <mark4>earth,</mark4><br>
Man's work-place, lay in <mark4>gloom.</mark4><br>
Return'st thou in her hour of <mark3>birth,</mark3><br>
Of hopes and hearts in <mark3>bloom?</mark3><br>
<br>
"Perceiv'st thou not the change of <mark3>day?</mark3><br>
Ah! Carry back thy <mark4>ken,</mark4><br>
What, some two thousand years! <mark3>Survey</mark3><br>
The world as it was <mark3>then!</mark3><br>
<br>
"Like ours it look'd in outward <mark4>air.</mark4><br>
Its head was clear and <mark1>true,</mark1><br>
Sumptuous its clothing, rich its <mark1>fare,</mark1><br>
No pause its action <mark1>knew;</mark1><br>
<br>
"Stout was its arm, each thew and <mark4>bone</mark4><br>
Seem'd puissant and <mark3>alive?</mark3><br>
But, ah! its heart, its heart was <mark3>stone,</mark3><br>
And so it could not <mark3>thrive!</mark3><br>
<br>
"On that hard Pagan world <mark4>disgust</mark4><br>
And secret loathing <mark4>fell.</mark4><br>
Deep weariness and sated <mark3>lust</mark3><br>
Made human life a <mark3>hell.</mark3><br>
<br>
"In his cool hall, with haggard <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
The Roman noble <mark3>lay;</mark3><br>
He drove abroad, in furious <mark3>guise,</mark3><br>
Along the Appian <mark1>way.</mark1><br>
<br>
"He made a <mark4>feast</mark4>, drank fierce and <mark4>fast,</mark4><br>
And crown'd his hair with <mark4>flowers?</mark4><br>
No easier nor no quicker <mark4>pass'd</mark4><br>
The impracticable <mark4>hours.</mark4><br>
<br>
"The brooding East with awe <mark4>beheld</mark4><br>
Her impious younger <mark4>world.</mark4><br>
The Roman tempest swell'd and <mark4>swell'd,</mark4><br>
And on her head was <mark4>hurl'd.</mark4><br>
<br>
"The East bow'd low before the <mark3>blast</mark3><br>
In patient, deep <mark4>disdain;</mark4><br>
She let the legions thunder <mark3>past,</mark3><br>
And plunged in thought <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
<br>
"So well she mused, a morning <mark3>broke</mark3><br>
Across her spirit <mark3>grey;</mark3><br>
A conquering, new-born joy <mark3>awoke,</mark3><br>
And fill'd her life with <mark1>day.</mark1><br>
<br>
   "'Poor world,' she cried, 'so deep accurst,<br>
That runn'st from pole to <mark4>pole</mark4><br>
To seek a draught to slake thy <mark4>thirst?</mark4><br>
Go, seek it in thy <mark3>soul!'</mark3><br>
<br>
"She heard <mark4>it</mark4>, the victorious <mark4>West,</mark4><br>
In crown and sword <mark4>array'd!</mark4><br>
She felt the void which mined her <mark1>breast,</mark1><br>
She shiver'd and <mark3>obey'd.</mark3><br>
<br>
"She veil'd her eagles, snapp'd her <mark4>sword,</mark4><br>
And laid her sceptre <mark1>down;</mark1><br>
Her stately purple she abhorr'd,<br>
And her imperial <mark1>crown.</mark1><br>
<br>
"She broke her <mark4>flutes</mark4>, she stopp'd her <mark4>sports,</mark4><br>
Her artists could not <mark4>please;</mark4><br>
She tore her <mark4>books</mark4>, she shut her <mark3>courts,</mark3><br>
She fled her <mark4>palaces;</mark4><br>
<br>
"Lust of the eye and pride of <mark4>life</mark4><br>
She left it all <mark4>behind,</mark4><br>
And hurried, torn with inward <mark3>strife,</mark3><br>
The wilderness to <mark3>find.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Tears wash'd the trouble from her <mark4>face!</mark4><br>
She changed into a <mark4>child!</mark4><br>
'Mid weeds and wrecks she stood?a <mark3>place</mark3><br>
Of ruin?but she <mark3>smiled!</mark3><br>
<br>
"Oh, had I lived in that great <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
How had its glory <mark2>new</mark2><br>
Fill'd earth and heaven, and caught <mark3>away</mark3><br>
My ravish'd spirit <mark3>too!</mark3><br>
<br>
"No thoughts that to the world <mark3>belong</mark3><br>
Had stood against the <mark4>wave</mark4><br>
Of love which set so deep and <mark3>strong</mark3><br>
From Christ's then open <mark3>grave.</mark3><br>
<br>
"No cloister-floor of humid <mark1>stone</mark1><br>
Had been too cold for <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
For me no Eastern desert <mark3>lone</mark3><br>
Had been too far to <mark3>flee.</mark3><br>
<br>
"No lonely life had pass'd too <mark3>slow,</mark3><br>
When I could hourly <mark4>scan</mark4><br>
Upon his Cross, with head sunk <mark3>low,</mark3><br>
That nail'd, thorn-crowned <mark3>Man!</mark3><br>
<br>
"Could see the Mother with her <mark1>Child</mark1><br>
Whose tender winning <mark4>arts</mark4><br>
Have to his little arms <mark3>beguiled</mark3><br>
So many wounded <mark3>hearts!</mark3><br>
<br>
"And centuries came and ran their <mark4>course,</mark4><br>
And unspent all that <mark4>time</mark4><br>
Still, still went forth that Child's dear <mark3>force,</mark3><br>
And still was at its <mark3>prime.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Ay, ages long endured his <mark3>span</mark3><br>
Of life?'tis true <mark4>received?</mark4><br>
That gracious Child, that thorn-crown'd <mark1>Man!</mark1><br>
?He lived while we <mark3>believed.</mark3><br>
<br>
"While we believed, on earth he <mark4>went,</mark4><br>
And open stood his <mark1>grave.</mark1><br>
Men call'd from chamber, church, and <mark3>tent;</mark3><br>
And Christ was by to <mark3>save.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Now he is dead! Far hence he <mark4>lies</mark4><br>
In the lorn Syrian <mark4>town;</mark4><br>
And on his grave, with shining <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
The Syrian stars look <mark1>down.</mark1><br>
<br>
"In vain men still, with hoping <mark1>new,</mark1><br>
Regard his death-place <mark4>dumb,</mark4><br>
And say the stone is not yet <mark3>to,</mark3><br>
And wait for words to <mark1>come.</mark1><br>
<br>
"Ah, o'er that silent sacred <mark4>land,</mark4><br>
Of <mark4>sun</mark4>, and arid <mark1>stone,</mark1><br>
And crumbling wall, and sultry <mark3>sand,</mark3><br>
Sounds now one word <mark3>alone!</mark3><br>
<br>
"Unduped of fancy, henceforth <mark1>man</mark1><br>
Must labour!?must <mark4>resign</mark4><br>
His all too human creeds, and <mark1>scan</mark1><br>
Simply the way <mark4>divine!</mark4><br>
<br>
"But slow that tide of common <mark1>thought,</mark1><br>
Which bathed our life, <mark4>retired;</mark4><br>
Slow, slow the old world wore to nought,<br>
And pulse by pulse <mark3>expired.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Its frame yet stood without a <mark5>breach</mark5><br>
When blood and warmth were <mark4>fled;</mark4><br>
And still it spake its wonted <mark3>speech?</mark3><br>
But every word was <mark3>dead.</mark3><br>
<br>
"And oh, we cried, that on this <mark3>corse</mark3><br>
Might fall a freshening <mark4>storm!</mark4><br>
Rive its dry bones, and with new <mark1>force</mark1><br>
A new-sprung world <mark3>inform!</mark3><br>
<br>
"?Down came the storm! O'er France it <mark1>pass'd</mark1><br>
In sheets of scathing <mark4>fire;</mark4><br>
All Europe felt that fiery <mark1>blast,</mark1><br>
And shook as it rush'd by <mark5>her.</mark5><br>
<br>
"Down came the storm! In ruins <mark1>fell</mark1><br>
The worn-out world we <mark1>knew.</mark1><br>
It pass'd, that elemental <mark3>swell!</mark3><br>
Again appear'd the <mark3>blue;</mark3><br>
<br>
"The sun shone in the new-wash'd <mark1>sky,</mark1><br>
And what from heaven saw <mark3>he?</mark3><br>
Blocks of the past, like icebergs <mark3>high,</mark3><br>
Float on a rolling <mark3>sea!</mark3><br>
<br>
"Upon them plies the race of <mark1>man</mark1><br>
All it before <mark4>endeavour'd;</mark4><br>
'Ye live,' I cried, 'ye work and <mark3>plan,</mark3><br>
And know not ye are <mark3>sever'd!</mark3><br>
<br>
"'Poor fragments of a broken <mark1>world</mark1><br>
Whereon men pitch their <mark1>tent!</mark1><br>
Why were ye too to death not <mark1>hurl'd</mark1><br>
When your world's day was <mark3>spent?</mark3><br>
<br>
"'That glow of central fire is <mark4>done</mark4><br>
Which with its fusing <mark4>flame</mark4><br>
Knit all your parts, and kept you <mark3>one?</mark3><br>
But ye, ye are the <mark1>same!</mark1><br>
<br>
"'The past, its mask of union <mark4>on,</mark4><br>
Had ceased to live and <mark1>thrive.</mark1><br>
The past, its mask of union <mark3>gone,</mark3><br>
Say, is it more <mark1>alive?</mark1><br>
<br>
"'Your creeds are <mark1>dead</mark1>, your rites are <mark1>dead,</mark1><br>
Your social order <mark1>too!</mark1><br>
Where tarries he, the Power who <mark3>said:</mark3><br>
See, I make all things <mark1>new?</mark1><br>
<br>
"'The millions suffer still, and <mark4>grieve,</mark4><br>
And what can helpers <mark4>heal</mark4><br>
With old-world cures men half <mark3>believe</mark3><br>
For woes they wholly <mark3>feel?</mark3><br>
<br>
"'And yet men have such need of <mark3>joy!</mark3><br>
But joy whose grounds are <mark1>true;</mark1><br>
And joy that should all hearts <mark3>employ</mark3><br>
As when the past was <mark1>new.</mark1><br>
<br>
"'Ah, not the emotion of that <mark1>past,</mark1><br>
Its common hope, were <mark4>vain!</mark4><br>
Some new such hope must dawn at <mark3>last,</mark3><br>
Or man must toss in <mark1>pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
"'But now the old is out of <mark4>date,</mark4><br>
The new is not yet <mark4>born,</mark4><br>
And who can be alone <mark3>elate,</mark3><br>
While the world lies <mark3>forlorn?'</mark3><br>
<br>
"Then to the wilderness I <mark1>fled.?</mark1><br>
There among Alpine <mark4>snows</mark4><br>
And pastoral huts I hid my <mark3>head,</mark3><br>
And sought and found <mark3>repose.</mark3><br>
<br>
"It was not yet the appointed <mark4>hour.</mark4><br>
Sad, patient, and <mark4>resign'd,</mark4><br>
I watch'd the crocus fade and <mark3>flower,</mark3><br>
I felt the sun and <mark4>wind.</mark4><br>
<br>
"The day I lived in was not <mark4>mine,</mark4><br>
Man gets no second <mark1>day.</mark1><br>
In dreams I saw the future <mark1>shine?</mark1><br>
But ah! I could not <mark3>stay!</mark3><br>
<br>
"Action I had not, followers, <mark3>fame;</mark3><br>
I pass'd obscure, <mark1>alone.</mark1><br>
The after-world forgets my <mark1>name,</mark1><br>
Nor do I wish it <mark3>known.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Composed to bear, I lived and <mark4>died,</mark4><br>
And knew my life was <mark1>vain.</mark1><br>
With fate I murmur not, nor <mark3>chide;</mark3><br>
At Sevres by the <mark3>Seine</mark3><br>
<br>
"(If Paris that brief flight <mark3>allow)</mark3><br>
My humble tomb <mark4>explore!</mark4><br>
It bears: Eternity, be <mark3>thou</mark3><br>
My refuge! and no <mark1>more.</mark1><br>
<br>
"But thou, whom fellowship of <mark4>mood</mark4><br>
Did make from haunts of <mark1>strife</mark1><br>
Come to my <mark4>mountain-solitude,</mark4><br>
And learn my frustrate <mark1>life;</mark1><br>
<br>
"O thou, who, ere thy flying <mark1>span</mark1><br>
Was past of cheerful <mark1>youth,</mark1><br>
Didst find the solitary <mark1>man</mark1><br>
And love his cheerless <mark1>truth?</mark1><br>
<br>
"Despair not thou as I <mark4>despair'd,</mark4><br>
Nor be cold gloom thy <mark4>prison!</mark4><br>
Forward the gracious hours have <mark4>fared,</mark4><br>
And see! the sun is <mark3>risen!</mark3><br>
<br>
"He breaks the winter of the <mark1>past;</mark1><br>
A green, new earth <mark4>appears.</mark4><br>
Millions, whose life in ice lay <mark1>fast,</mark1><br>
Have thoughts, and <mark4>smiles</mark4>, and <mark3>tears.</mark3><br>
<br>
"What though there still need effort, <mark1>strife?</mark1><br>
Though much be still unwon?<br>
Yet warm it mounts, the hour of <mark1>life!</mark1><br>
Death's frozen hour is <mark1>done!</mark1><br>
<br>
"The world's great order dawns in <mark4>sheen,</mark4><br>
After long darkness <mark4>rude,</mark4><br>
Divinelier imaged, clearer <mark3>seen,</mark3><br>
With happier zeal <mark3>pursued.</mark3><br>
<br>
"With hope extinct and brow <mark4>composed</mark4><br>
I mark'd the present <mark3>die;</mark3><br>
Its term of life was nearly <mark3>closed,</mark3><br>
Yet it had more than <mark3>I.</mark3><br>
<br>
"But thou, though to the world's new <mark1>hour</mark1><br>
Thou come with aspect <mark4>marr'd,</mark4><br>
Shorn of the joy, the bloom, the <mark3>power,</mark3><br>
Which best befits its <mark4>bard?</mark4><br>
<br>
"Though more than half thy years be <mark1>past,</mark1><br>
And spent thy youthful <mark1>prime;</mark1><br>
Though, round thy firmer manhood <mark3>cast,</mark3><br>
Hang weeds of our sad <mark1>time</mark1><br>
<br>
"Whereof thy youth felt all the <mark4>spell,</mark4><br>
And traversed all the <mark4>shade?</mark4><br>
Though late, though dimm'd, though weak, yet <mark3>tell</mark3><br>
Hope to a world <mark3>new-made!</mark3><br>
<br>
"Help it to fill that deep <mark1>desire,</mark1><br>
The want which rack'd our <mark4>brain,</mark4><br>
Consumed our heart with thirst like <mark1>fire,</mark1><br>
Immedicable <mark1>pain;</mark1><br>
<br>
"Which to the wilderness drove <mark4>out</mark4><br>
Our life, to Alpine <mark3>snow,</mark3><br>
And palsied all our word with <mark3>doubt,</mark3><br>
And all our work with <mark3>woe?</mark3><br>
<br>
"What still of strength is left, <mark1>employ</mark1><br>
That end to help <mark3>attain:</mark3><br>
One common wave of thought and <mark1>joy</mark1><br>
Lifting mankind <mark1>again!"</mark1><br>
<br>
?The vision ended. I <mark1>awoke</mark1><br>
As out of sleep, and <mark3>no</mark3><br>
Voice moved;?only the torrent <mark1>broke</mark1><br>
The silence, far <mark1>below.</mark1><br>
<br>
Soft darkness on the turf did <mark3>lie.</mark3><br>
Solemn, o'er hut and <mark1>wood,</mark1><br>
In the yet star-sown nightly <mark1>sky,</mark1><br>
The peak of Jaman <mark1>stood.</mark1><br>
<br>
Still in my soul the voice I <mark4>heard</mark4><br>
Of <mark5>Obermann!?away</mark5><br>
I turn'd; by some vague impulse <mark5>stirr'd,</mark5><br>
Along the rocks of Naye<br>
<br>
Past Sonchaud's piny flanks I <mark4>gaze</mark4><br>
And the blanch'd summit <mark4>bare</mark4><br>
Of Malatrait, to where in <mark3>haze</mark3><br>
The Valais opens <mark3>fair,</mark3><br>
<br>
And the domed Velan, with his <mark1>snows,</mark1><br>
Behind the upcrowding <mark4>hills,</mark4><br>
Doth all the heavenly opening <mark4>close</mark4><br>
Which the Rhone's murmur <mark4>fills?</mark4><br>
<br>
And glorious there, without a <mark4>sound,</mark4><br>
Across the glimmering <mark4>lake,</mark4><br>
High in the Valais-depth <mark1>profound,</mark1><br>
I saw the morning <mark3>break.</mark3><br>
