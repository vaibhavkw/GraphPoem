Title : Recitative<br>
Author : A. E. Stallings<br><br>

Every night, we couldn't <mark3>sleep.</mark3><br>
Our upstairs neighbors had to <mark3>keep</mark3><br>
Dropping something down the <mark3>hall--</mark3><br>
A barbell or a bowling <mark3>ball,</mark3><br>
<br>
And from the window by the <mark3>bed,</mark3><br>
Echoing inside my <mark3>head,</mark3><br>
Alley cats expended <mark3>breath</mark3><br>
In arias of love and <mark3>death.</mark3><br>
<br>
Dawn again, across the <mark3>street,</mark3><br>
Jackhammers began to <mark3>beat</mark3><br>
Like hangovers, and you would <mark3>frown--</mark3><br>
That well-built house, why tear it <mark3>down?</mark3><br>
<br>
Noon, the radiator <mark4>grill</mark4><br>
Groaned, gave off a lesser <mark3>chill</mark3><br>
So that we could take off our <mark3>coats.</mark3><br>
The pipes coughed to clear their <mark3>throats.</mark3><br>
<br>
Our nerves were frayed like ravelled <mark5>sleeves,</mark5><br>
We cherished each our minor <mark5>griefs</mark5><br>
To keep them warm until the <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
When it was time again to <mark3>fight;</mark3><br>
<br>
But we were young, did not need <mark3>much</mark3><br>
To make us laugh instead, and <mark3>touch,</mark3><br>
And could not hear ourselves <mark3>above</mark3><br>
The arias of death and <mark3>love.</mark3><br>
