Title : Spring and Fall <br>
Author : Gerard Manley Hopkins <br><br>

to a young child<br>
Margaret, are you grieving <br>
Over Goldengrove unleaving? <br>
Leaves like the things of man, <mark1>you</mark1><br>
With your fresh thoughts care for, can <mark1>you?</mark1><br>
Ah! as the heart grows <mark3>older</mark3><br>
It will come to such sights <mark3>colder</mark3><br>
By and <mark3>by</mark3>, nor spare a <mark3>sigh</mark3><br>
Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal <mark3>lie;</mark3><br>
And yet you will weep and know <mark3>why.</mark3><br>
Now no matter, child, the <mark3>name:</mark3><br>
Sorrow's springs are the <mark3>same.</mark3><br>
Nor mouth had, no nor mind, <mark3>expressed</mark3><br>
What heart heard of, ghost <mark3>guessed:</mark3><br>
It is the blight man was born <mark4>for,</mark4><br>
It is Margaret you mourn <mark1>for.</mark1><br>
