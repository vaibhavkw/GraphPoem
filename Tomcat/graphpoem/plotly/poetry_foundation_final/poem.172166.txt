Title : The Soldier <br>
Author : David Ferry <br><br>

Saturday afternoon. The barracks is almost <mark4>empty.</mark4><br>
The soldiers are almost all on overnight <mark4>pass.</mark4><br>
There is only me, writing this letter to you, <br>
And one other soldier, down at the end of the <mark4>room,</mark4><br>
And a spider, that hangs by the thread of his <mark4>guts,</mark4><br>
His tenacious and delicate guts, Swift's <mark4>spider,</mark4><br>
All self-regard, or else all <mark4>privacy.</mark4><br>
The dust drifts in the sunlight around him, as <mark4>currents</mark4><br>
Lie in lazy, drifting schools in the vast sea. <br>
In his little sea the spider lowers <mark1>himself</mark1><br>
Out of his depth. He is his own diving bell, <br>
Though he cannot see well. He observes no fish,   <br>
And sees no wonderful things. His unseeing <mark1>guts</mark1><br>
Are his only hold on the world outside <mark1>himself.</mark1><br>
I love you, and miss you, and I find you hard to imagine.   <br>
Down at the end of the room, the other <mark4>soldier</mark4><br>
Is getting ready, I <mark4>guess</mark4>, to go out on <mark1>pass.</mark1><br>
He is shining his boots. He sits on the edge of his bunk,   <br>
Private, submissive, and heedful of <mark1>himself,</mark1><br>
And, bending over himself, he is his own nest.   <br>
The slightest sound he makes is of his being.   <br>
He is his mother, and nest, wife, <mark4>brother</mark4>, and <mark4>father.</mark4><br>
His boots are bright already, yet still he rubs <br>
And rubs till, brighter still, they are his <mark4>mirror,</mark4><br>
And in this mirror he observes, I <mark4>guess,</mark4><br>
His own submissiveness. He is far from <mark4>home.</mark4><br>
