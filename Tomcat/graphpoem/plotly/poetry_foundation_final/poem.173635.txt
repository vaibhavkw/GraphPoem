Title : The Pulley <br>
Author : George Herbert <br><br>

When God at first made <mark3>man,</mark3><br>
Having a glass of blessings standing <mark3>by,</mark3><br>
"Let us," said he, "pour on him all we <mark3>can.</mark3><br>
Let the world's riches, which dispersed <mark3>lie,</mark3><br>
Contract into a <mark3>span."</mark3><br>
<br>
So strength first made a <mark3>way;</mark3><br>
Then beauty flowed, then wisdom, <mark4>honour</mark4>, <mark4>pleasure.</mark4><br>
When almost all was out, God made a <mark3>stay,</mark3><br>
Perceiving that, alone of all his <mark3>treasure,</mark3><br>
Rest in the bottom <mark3>lay.</mark3><br>
<br>
"For if I should," said <mark3>he,</mark3><br>
"Bestow this jewel also on my <mark4>creature,</mark4><br>
He would adore my gifts instead of <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
And rest in <mark1>Nature</mark1>, not the God of <mark4>Nature;</mark4><br>
So both should losers <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Yet let him keep the <mark5>rest,</mark5><br>
But keep them with repining <mark5>restlessness;</mark5><br>
Let him be rich and weary, that at <mark4>least,</mark4><br>
If goodness lead him not, yet <mark4>weariness</mark4><br>
May toss him to my <mark4>breast."</mark4><br>
