Title : It is not to be Thought of <br>
Author : William Wordsworth <br><br>

<br>
It is not to be thought of that the <mark4>Flood</mark4><br>
Of British freedom, which, to the open sea<br>
Of the world's praise, from dark antiquity<br>
Hath flowed, "with pomp of waters, unwithstood,"<br>
Roused though it be full often to a <mark4>mood</mark4><br>
Which spurns the check of salutary <mark3>bands,</mark3><br>
That this most famous Stream in bogs and <mark3>sands</mark3><br>
Should perish; and to evil and to <mark4>good</mark4><br>
Be lost for ever. In our halls is <mark3>hung</mark3><br>
Armoury of the invincible Knights of <mark4>old:</mark4><br>
We must be free or die, who speak the <mark3>tongue</mark3><br>
That Shakespeare spake; the faith and morals <mark3>hold</mark3><br>
Which Milton held.?In every thing we are <mark3>sprung</mark3><br>
Of Earth's first <mark4>blood</mark4>, have titles <mark4>manifold.</mark4><br>
