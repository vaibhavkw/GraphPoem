Title : The Canonization <br>
Author : John Donne <br><br>

For God's sake hold your tongue, and let me <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
Or chide my palsy, or my <mark3>gout,</mark3><br>
My five gray hairs, or ruined fortune <mark3>flout,</mark3><br>
With wealth your state, your mind with arts <mark4>improve,</mark4><br>
Take you a <mark4>course</mark4>, get you a <mark4>place,</mark4><br>
Observe his honor, or his <mark3>grace,</mark3><br>
Or the king's real, or his stamped <mark3>face</mark3><br>
Contemplate; what you will, <mark3>approve,</mark3><br>
So you will let me <mark1>love.</mark1><br>
<br>
Alas, alas, who's injured by my <mark1>love?</mark1><br>
What merchant's ships have my sighs <mark3>drowned?</mark3><br>
Who says my tears have overflowed his <mark3>ground?</mark3><br>
When did my colds a forward spring <mark4>remove?</mark4><br>
When did the heats which my veins <mark3>fill</mark3><br>
Add one more to the plaguy <mark3>bill?</mark3><br>
Soldiers find wars, and lawyers find out <mark3>still</mark3><br>
Litigious men, which quarrels <mark3>move,</mark3><br>
Though she and I do <mark1>love.</mark1><br>
<br>
Call us what you will, we are made such by <mark1>love;</mark1><br>
Call her one, me another <mark3>fly,</mark3><br>
We're tapers too, and at our own cost <mark3>die,</mark3><br>
And we in us find the eagle and the <mark3>dove.</mark3><br>
The phoenix riddle hath more <mark4>wit</mark4><br>
By us; we two being one, are <mark3>it.</mark3><br>
So, to one neutral thing both sexes <mark3>fit.</mark3><br>
We die and rise the same, and <mark4>prove</mark4><br>
Mysterious by this <mark1>love.</mark1><br>
<br>
We can die by it, if not live by <mark1>love,</mark1><br>
And if unfit for tombs and <mark4>hearse</mark4><br>
Our legend be, it will be fit for <mark3>verse;</mark3><br>
And if no piece of chronicle we <mark1>prove,</mark1><br>
We'll build in sonnets pretty <mark4>rooms;</mark4><br>
As well a well-wrought urn <mark4>becomes</mark4><br>
The greatest <mark4>ashes</mark4>, as half-acre <mark4>tombs,</mark4><br>
And by these hymns, all shall <mark1>approve</mark1><br>
Us canonized for <mark1>Love.</mark1><br>
<br>
And thus invoke us: "You, whom reverend <mark1>love</mark1><br>
Made one another's <mark4>hermitage;</mark4><br>
You, to whom love was peace, that now is <mark4>rage;</mark4><br>
Who did the whole world's soul contract, and <mark4>drove</mark4><br>
Into the glasses of your <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
(So made such <mark4>mirrors</mark4>, and such <mark3>spies,</mark3><br>
That they did all to you <mark4>epitomize)</mark4><br>
Countries, towns, courts: beg from <mark4>above</mark4><br>
A pattern of your <mark1>love!"</mark1><br>
