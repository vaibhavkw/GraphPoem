Title : from The Princess: As thro' the Land <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

<br>
As thro' the land at eve we <mark4>went,</mark4><br>
And pluck'd the ripen'd <mark3>ears,</mark3><br>
We fell out, my wife and <mark3>I,</mark3><br>
O we fell out I know not <mark3>why,</mark3><br>
And kiss'd again with <mark3>tears.</mark3><br>
And blessings on the falling <mark4>out</mark4><br>
      That all the more endears,<br>
When we fall out with those we <mark4>love</mark4><br>
And kiss again with <mark1>tears!</mark1><br>
For when we came where lies the child<br>
We lost in other <mark3>years,</mark3><br>
There above the little <mark4>grave,</mark4><br>
O there above the little <mark1>grave,</mark1><br>
We kiss'd again with <mark1>tears.</mark1><br>
