Title : The Definition of Love <br>
Author : Andrew Marvell <br><br>

My love is of a birth as <mark3>rare</mark3><br>
As 'tis for object strange and high; <br>
It was begotten by <mark3>Despair</mark3><br>
Upon <mark4>Impossibility.</mark4><br>
<br>
Magnanimous Despair <mark3>alone</mark3><br>
Could show me so divine a <mark3>thing</mark3><br>
Where feeble Hope could ne'er have <mark3>flown,</mark3><br>
But vainly flapp'd its tinsel <mark3>wing.</mark3><br>
<br>
And yet I quickly might <mark3>arrive</mark3><br>
Where my extended soul is fixt, <br>
But Fate does iron wedges <mark3>drive,</mark3><br>
And always crowds itself <mark4>betwixt.</mark4><br>
<br>
For Fate with jealous eye does <mark3>see</mark3><br>
Two perfect <mark4>loves</mark4>, nor lets them <mark4>close;</mark4><br>
Their union would her ruin <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
And her tyrannic pow'r <mark3>depose.</mark3><br>
<br>
And therefore her decrees of <mark3>steel</mark3><br>
Us as the distant poles have <mark5>plac'd,</mark5><br>
(Though love's whole world on us doth <mark3>wheel)</mark3><br>
Not by themselves to be embrac'd; <br>
<br>
Unless the giddy heaven <mark4>fall,</mark4><br>
And earth some new convulsion <mark3>tear;</mark3><br>
And, us to join, the world should <mark3>all</mark3><br>
Be cramp'd into a <mark5>planisphere.</mark5><br>
<br>
As lines, so loves oblique may <mark4>well</mark4><br>
Themselves in every angle <mark4>greet;</mark4><br>
But ours so truly <mark4>parallel,</mark4><br>
Though <mark4>infinite</mark4>, can never <mark3>meet.</mark3><br>
<br>
Therefore the love which us doth <mark3>bind,</mark3><br>
But Fate so enviously debars, <br>
Is the conjunction of the <mark3>mind,</mark3><br>
And opposition of the <mark4>stars.</mark4><br>
