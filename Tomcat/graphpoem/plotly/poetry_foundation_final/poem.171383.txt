Title : Poem ["The eager note on my door said, 'Call me,'"] <br>
Author : Frank O'Hara <br><br>

The eager note on my door said "Call me,   <br>
call when you get in!" so I quickly <mark3>threw</mark3><br>
a few tangerines into my overnight bag,   <br>
straightened my eyelids and shoulders, and <br>
<br>
headed straight for the door. It was autumn   <br>
by the time I got around the corner, oh all <br>
unwilling to be either pertinent or bemused, <mark4>but</mark4><br>
the leaves were brighter than grass on the sidewalk! <br>
<br>
Funny, I <mark4>thought</mark4>, that the lights are on this <mark4>late</mark4><br>
and the hall door open; still up at this hour, a   <br>
champion jai-alai player like himself? Oh fie!   <br>
for shame! What a host, so zealous! And he was <br>
<br>
there in the hall, flat on a sheet of blood <mark4>that</mark4><br>
ran down the stairs. I did appreciate it. There are <mark3>few</mark3><br>
hosts who so thoroughly prepare to greet a <mark4>guest</mark4><br>
only casually invited, and that several months ago.<br>
