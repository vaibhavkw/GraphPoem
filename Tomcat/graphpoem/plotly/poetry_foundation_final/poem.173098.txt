Title : The Prisoner of Chillon <br>
Author : Lord Byron (George Gordon) <br><br>

My hair is grey, but not with <mark3>years,</mark3><br>
Nor grew it <mark3>white</mark3><br>
In a single <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
As men's have grown from sudden <mark3>fears:</mark3><br>
My limbs are bow'd, though not with <mark3>toil,</mark3><br>
But rusted with a vile <mark4>repose,</mark4><br>
For they have been a dungeon's <mark3>spoil,</mark3><br>
And mine has been the fate of <mark3>those</mark3><br>
To whom the goodly earth and <mark3>air</mark3><br>
Are bann'd, and barr'd?forbidden <mark3>fare;</mark3><br>
But this was for my father's <mark4>faith</mark4><br>
I suffer'd chains and courted <mark4>death;</mark4><br>
That father perish'd at the <mark3>stake</mark3><br>
For tenets he would not <mark3>forsake;</mark3><br>
And for the same his lineal <mark3>race</mark3><br>
In darkness found a dwelling <mark3>place;</mark3><br>
We were seven?who now are <mark3>one,</mark3><br>
Six in youth, and one in <mark3>age,</mark3><br>
Finish'd as they had <mark3>begun,</mark3><br>
Proud of Persecution's <mark3>rage;</mark3><br>
One in fire, and two in <mark4>field,</mark4><br>
Their belief with blood have <mark4>seal'd,</mark4><br>
Dying as their father <mark4>died,</mark4><br>
For the God their foes <mark3>denied;?</mark3><br>
Three were in a dungeon <mark4>cast,</mark4><br>
Of whom this wreck is left the <mark3>last.</mark3><br>
<br>
There are seven pillars of Gothic <mark4>mould,</mark4><br>
In Chillon's dungeons deep and <mark3>old,</mark3><br>
There are seven columns, massy and <mark3>grey,</mark3><br>
Dim with a dull imprison'd <mark3>ray,</mark3><br>
A sunbeam which hath lost its <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
And through the crevice and the <mark4>cleft</mark4><br>
Of the thick wall is fallen and <mark3>left;</mark3><br>
Creeping o'er the floor so <mark3>damp,</mark3><br>
Like a marsh's meteor <mark3>lamp:</mark3><br>
And in each pillar there is a <mark3>ring,</mark3><br>
And in each ring there is a <mark4>chain;</mark4><br>
That iron is a cankering <mark3>thing,</mark3><br>
For in these limbs its teeth <mark3>remain,</mark3><br>
With marks that will not wear <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
Till I have done with this new <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
Which now is painful to these <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
Which have not seen the sun so <mark3>rise</mark3><br>
For years?I cannot count them <mark4>o'er,</mark4><br>
I lost their long and heavy <mark4>score</mark4><br>
When my last brother droop'd and <mark1>died,</mark1><br>
And I lay living by his <mark3>side.</mark3><br>
<br>
They chain'd us each to a column <mark4>stone,</mark4><br>
And we were three?yet, each <mark3>alone;</mark3><br>
We could not move a single <mark3>pace,</mark3><br>
We could not see each other's <mark3>face,</mark3><br>
But with that pale and livid <mark4>light</mark4><br>
That made us strangers in our <mark3>sight:</mark3><br>
And thus together?yet <mark4>apart,</mark4><br>
Fetter'd in hand, but join'd in <mark3>heart,</mark3><br>
'Twas still some solace in the <mark4>dearth</mark4><br>
Of the pure elements of <mark3>earth,</mark3><br>
To hearken to each other's <mark3>speech,</mark3><br>
And each turn comforter to <mark3>each</mark3><br>
With some new hope, or legend <mark1>old,</mark1><br>
Or song heroically <mark3>bold;</mark3><br>
But even these at length grew <mark3>cold.</mark3><br>
Our voices took a dreary <mark3>tone,</mark3><br>
An echo of the dungeon <mark1>stone,</mark1><br>
A grating sound, not full and <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
As they of yore were wont to <mark3>be:</mark3><br>
It might be fancy?but to <mark3>me</mark3><br>
They never sounded like our <mark3>own.</mark3><br>
<br>
I was the eldest of the <mark3>three</mark3><br>
And to uphold and cheer the <mark4>rest</mark4><br>
I ought to do?and did my <mark3>best?</mark3><br>
And each did well in his <mark3>degree.</mark3><br>
The youngest, whom my father <mark4>loved,</mark4><br>
Because our mother's brow was <mark4>given</mark4><br>
To him, with eyes as blue as <mark4>heaven?</mark4><br>
For him my soul was sorely <mark4>moved:</mark4><br>
And truly might it be <mark4>distress'd</mark4><br>
To see such bird in such a <mark3>nest;</mark3><br>
For he was beautiful as <mark1>day?</mark1><br>
(When day was beautiful to <mark1>me</mark1><br>
As to young eagles, being <mark1>free)?</mark1><br>
A polar day, which will not <mark3>see</mark3><br>
A sunset till its summer's <mark4>gone,</mark4><br>
Its sleepless summer of long <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
The snow-clad offspring of the <mark4>sun:</mark4><br>
And thus he was as pure and <mark3>bright,</mark3><br>
And in his natural spirit <mark3>gay,</mark3><br>
With tears for nought but others' <mark4>ills,</mark4><br>
And then they flow'd like mountain rills,<br>
Unless he could assuage the <mark3>woe</mark3><br>
Which he abhorr'd to view <mark3>below.</mark3><br>
<br>
The other was as pure of <mark4>mind,</mark4><br>
But form'd to combat with his <mark3>kind;</mark3><br>
Strong in his frame, and of a <mark4>mood</mark4><br>
Which 'gainst the world in war had <mark4>stood,</mark4><br>
And perish'd in the foremost <mark4>rank</mark4><br>
With joy:?but not in chains to <mark4>pine:</mark4><br>
His spirit wither'd with their <mark3>clank,</mark3><br>
I saw it silently <mark3>decline?</mark3><br>
And so perchance in sooth did <mark3>mine:</mark3><br>
But yet I forced it on to <mark4>cheer</mark4><br>
Those relics of a home so <mark3>dear.</mark3><br>
He was a hunter of the <mark3>hills,</mark3><br>
Had followed there the deer and <mark4>wolf;</mark4><br>
To him this dungeon was a <mark4>gulf,</mark4><br>
And fetter'd feet the worst of <mark1>ills.</mark1><br>
<br>
Lake Leman lies by Chillon's <mark4>walls:</mark4><br>
A thousand feet in depth <mark1>below</mark1><br>
Its massy waters meet and <mark3>flow;</mark3><br>
Thus much the fathom-line was <mark4>sent</mark4><br>
From Chillon's snow-white <mark4>battlement,</mark4><br>
       Which round about the wave inthralls:<br>
A double dungeon wall and <mark3>wave</mark3><br>
Have made?and like a living <mark3>grave</mark3><br>
Below the surface of the <mark4>lake</mark4><br>
The dark vault lies wherein we <mark3>lay:</mark3><br>
We heard it ripple night and <mark1>day;</mark1><br>
Sounding o'er our heads it <mark4>knock'd;</mark4><br>
And I have felt the winter's <mark3>spray</mark3><br>
Wash through the bars when winds were <mark3>high</mark3><br>
And wanton in the happy <mark3>sky;</mark3><br>
And then the very rock hath <mark3>rock'd,</mark3><br>
       And I have felt it shake, unshock'd,<br>
Because I could have smiled to <mark1>see</mark1><br>
The death that would have set me <mark1>free.</mark1><br>
<br>
I said my nearer brother <mark4>pined,</mark4><br>
I said his mighty heart <mark3>declined,</mark3><br>
He loathed and put away his <mark4>food;</mark4><br>
It was not that 'twas coarse and <mark3>rude,</mark3><br>
For we were used to hunter's <mark1>fare,</mark1><br>
And for the like had little <mark3>care:</mark3><br>
The milk drawn from the mountain <mark4>goat</mark4><br>
Was changed for water from the <mark3>moat,</mark3><br>
Our bread was such as captives' <mark4>tears</mark4><br>
Have moisten'd many a thousand <mark1>years,</mark1><br>
Since man first pent his fellow <mark4>men</mark4><br>
Like brutes within an iron <mark3>den;</mark3><br>
But what were these to us or <mark3>him?</mark3><br>
These wasted not his heart or <mark3>limb;</mark3><br>
My brother's soul was of that <mark1>mould</mark1><br>
Which in a palace had grown <mark1>cold,</mark1><br>
Had his free breathing been <mark1>denied</mark1><br>
The range of the steep mountain's <mark1>side;</mark1><br>
But why delay the truth??he <mark1>died.</mark1><br>
I saw, and could not hold his <mark4>head,</mark4><br>
Nor reach his dying hand?nor <mark3>dead,?</mark3><br>
Though hard I strove, but strove in <mark4>vain,</mark4><br>
To rend and gnash my bonds in <mark3>twain.</mark3><br>
He died?and they unlock'd his <mark1>chain,</mark1><br>
And scoop'd for him a shallow <mark1>grave</mark1><br>
Even from the cold earth of our <mark3>cave.</mark3><br>
I begg'd them, as a boon, to <mark1>lay</mark1><br>
His corse in dust whereon the <mark1>day</mark1><br>
Might shine?it was a foolish <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
But then within my brain it <mark3>wrought,</mark3><br>
That even in death his freeborn <mark4>breast</mark4><br>
In such a dungeon could not <mark1>rest.</mark1><br>
I might have spared my idle <mark3>prayer?</mark3><br>
They coldly laugh'd?and laid him <mark3>there:</mark3><br>
The flat and turfless earth <mark4>above</mark4><br>
The being we so much did <mark3>love;</mark3><br>
His empty chain above it <mark4>leant,</mark4><br>
Such Murder's fitting <mark4>monument!</mark4><br>
<br>
But he, the favourite and the <mark4>flower,</mark4><br>
Most cherish'd since his natal <mark3>hour,</mark3><br>
His mother's image in fair <mark1>face</mark1><br>
The infant love of all his <mark1>race</mark1><br>
His martyr'd father's dearest <mark1>thought,</mark1><br>
My latest care, for whom I <mark3>sought</mark3><br>
To hoard my life, that his might <mark1>be</mark1><br>
Less wretched now, and one day <mark1>free;</mark1><br>
He, too, who yet had held untired<br>
A spirit natural or <mark4>inspired?</mark4><br>
He, too, was struck, and day by <mark1>day</mark1><br>
Was wither'd on the stalk <mark1>away.</mark1><br>
Oh, God! it is a fearful <mark1>thing</mark1><br>
To see the human soul take <mark3>wing</mark3><br>
In any shape, in any <mark1>mood:</mark1><br>
I've seen it rushing forth in <mark4>blood,</mark4><br>
I've seen it on the breaking <mark4>ocean</mark4><br>
Strive with a swoln convulsive <mark3>motion,</mark3><br>
I've seen the sick and ghastly <mark4>bed</mark4><br>
Of Sin delirious with its <mark3>dread:</mark3><br>
But these were horrors?this was <mark1>woe</mark1><br>
Unmix'd with such?but sure and <mark3>slow:</mark3><br>
He faded, and so calm and <mark4>meek,</mark4><br>
So softly worn, so sweetly <mark3>weak,</mark3><br>
So tearless, yet so <mark5>tender?kind,</mark5><br>
And grieved for those he left <mark4>behind;</mark4><br>
With all the while a cheek whose <mark4>bloom</mark4><br>
Was as a mockery of the <mark3>tomb</mark3><br>
Whose tints as gently sunk <mark1>away</mark1><br>
As a departing rainbow's <mark1>ray;</mark1><br>
An eye of most transparent <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
That almost made the dungeon <mark1>bright;</mark1><br>
And not a word of murmur?not<br>
A groan o'er his untimely <mark4>lot,?</mark4><br>
A little talk of better <mark4>days,</mark4><br>
A little hope my own to <mark3>raise,</mark3><br>
For I was sunk in silence?lost<br>
In this last <mark4>loss</mark4>, of all the <mark4>most;</mark4><br>
And then the sighs he would <mark4>suppress</mark4><br>
Of fainting Nature's <mark5>feebleness,</mark5><br>
More slowly drawn, grew less and <mark3>less:</mark3><br>
I listen'd, but I could not <mark4>hear;</mark4><br>
I call'd, for I was wild with <mark4>fear;</mark4><br>
I knew 'twas hopeless, but my <mark1>dread</mark1><br>
Would not be thus <mark4>admonished;</mark4><br>
I call'd, and thought I heard a <mark4>sound?</mark4><br>
I burst my chain with one strong <mark3>bound,</mark3><br>
And rushed to him:?I found him <mark4>not,</mark4><br>
I only stirred in this black <mark3>spot,</mark3><br>
I only lived, I only <mark5>drew</mark5><br>
The accursed breath of <mark3>dungeon-dew;</mark3><br>
The last, the sole, the dearest <mark4>link</mark4><br>
Between me and the eternal <mark3>brink,</mark3><br>
Which bound me to my failing <mark1>race</mark1><br>
Was broken in this fatal <mark1>place.</mark1><br>
One on the <mark4>earth</mark4>, and one <mark4>beneath?</mark4><br>
My brothers?both had ceased to <mark5>breathe:</mark5><br>
I took that hand which lay so <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
Alas! my own was full as <mark3>chill;</mark3><br>
I had not strength to stir, or <mark4>strive,</mark4><br>
But felt that I was still <mark3>alive?</mark3><br>
A frantic feeling, when we <mark3>know</mark3><br>
That what we love shall ne'er be <mark3>so.</mark3><br>
I know not <mark3>why</mark3><br>
I could not <mark3>die,</mark3><br>
I had no earthly hope?but <mark1>faith,</mark1><br>
And that forbade a selfish <mark1>death.</mark1><br>
<br>
What next befell me then and <mark1>there</mark1><br>
I know not well?I never <mark3>knew?</mark3><br>
First came the loss of light, and <mark1>air,</mark1><br>
And then of darkness <mark3>too:</mark3><br>
I had no thought, no <mark5>feeling?none?</mark5><br>
Among the stones I stood a <mark1>stone,</mark1><br>
And was, scarce conscious what I <mark4>wist,</mark4><br>
As shrubless crags within the <mark3>mist;</mark3><br>
For all was blank, and bleak, and <mark1>grey;</mark1><br>
It was not night?it was not <mark1>day;</mark1><br>
It was not even the <mark4>dungeon-light,</mark4><br>
So hateful to my heavy <mark1>sight,</mark1><br>
But vacancy absorbing <mark3>space,</mark3><br>
And fixedness?without a <mark1>place;</mark1><br>
There were no stars, no earth, no <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
No check, no change, no good, no <mark3>crime</mark3><br>
But silence, and a stirless <mark3>breath</mark3><br>
Which neither was of life nor <mark1>death;</mark1><br>
A sea of stagnant <mark4>idleness,</mark4><br>
Blind, boundless, mute, and <mark4>motionless!</mark4><br>
A light broke in upon my <mark4>brain,?</mark4><br>
It was the carol of a <mark4>bird;</mark4><br>
It ceased, and then it came <mark3>again,</mark3><br>
The sweetest song ear ever <mark3>heard,</mark3><br>
And mine was thankful till my <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
Ran over with the glad <mark3>surprise,</mark3><br>
And they that moment could not <mark1>see</mark1><br>
I was the mate of <mark4>misery;</mark4><br>
But then by dull degrees came <mark4>back</mark4><br>
My senses to their wonted <mark3>track;</mark3><br>
I saw the dungeon walls and <mark4>floor</mark4><br>
Close slowly round me as <mark3>before,</mark3><br>
I saw the glimmer of the <mark1>sun</mark1><br>
Creeping as it before had <mark3>done,</mark3><br>
But through the crevice where it <mark4>came</mark4><br>
That bird was perch'd, as fond and <mark3>tame,</mark3><br>
And tamer than upon the <mark3>tree;</mark3><br>
A lovely bird, with azure <mark4>wings,</mark4><br>
And song that said a thousand <mark3>things,</mark3><br>
And seemed to say them all for <mark1>me!</mark1><br>
I never saw its like <mark1>before,</mark1><br>
I ne'er shall see its likeness <mark3>more:</mark3><br>
It seem'd like me to want a <mark4>mate,</mark4><br>
But was not half so <mark4>desolate,</mark4><br>
And it was come to love me <mark4>when</mark4><br>
None lived to love me so <mark1>again,</mark1><br>
And cheering from my dungeon's <mark1>brink,</mark1><br>
Had brought me back to feel and <mark3>think.</mark3><br>
I know not if it late were <mark1>free,</mark1><br>
Or broke its cage to perch on <mark1>mine,</mark1><br>
But knowing well <mark4>captivity,</mark4><br>
Sweet bird! I could not wish for <mark3>thine!</mark3><br>
Or if it were, in winged <mark4>guise,</mark4><br>
A visitant from <mark4>Paradise;</mark4><br>
For?Heaven forgive that thought! the <mark4>while</mark4><br>
Which made me both to weep and <mark3>smile?</mark3><br>
I sometimes deem'd that it might <mark1>be</mark1><br>
My brother's soul come down to <mark1>me;</mark1><br>
But then at last away it <mark3>flew,</mark3><br>
And then 'twas mortal well I <mark1>knew,</mark1><br>
For he would never thus have <mark4>flown?</mark4><br>
And left me twice so doubly <mark3>lone,?</mark3><br>
Lone as the corse within its <mark4>shroud,</mark4><br>
Lone as a solitary <mark3>cloud,</mark3><br>
A single cloud on a sunny <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
While all the rest of heaven is <mark4>clear,</mark4><br>
A frown upon the <mark4>atmosphere,</mark4><br>
That hath no business to <mark4>appear</mark4><br>
When skies are blue, and earth is <mark1>gay.</mark1><br>
<br>
A kind of change came in my <mark4>fate,</mark4><br>
My keepers grew <mark4>compassionate;</mark4><br>
I know not what had made them <mark1>so,</mark1><br>
They were inured to sights of <mark1>woe,</mark1><br>
But so it was:?my broken <mark1>chain</mark1><br>
With links unfasten'd did <mark1>remain,</mark1><br>
And it was liberty to <mark4>stride</mark4><br>
Along my cell from side to <mark1>side,</mark1><br>
And up and down, and then <mark4>athwart,</mark4><br>
And tread it over every <mark4>part;</mark4><br>
And round the pillars one by <mark1>one,</mark1><br>
Returning where my walk <mark1>begun,</mark1><br>
Avoiding only, as I <mark4>trod,</mark4><br>
My brothers' graves without a <mark3>sod;</mark3><br>
For if I thought with heedless <mark4>tread</mark4><br>
My step profaned their lowly <mark1>bed,</mark1><br>
My breath came gaspingly and <mark4>thick,</mark4><br>
And my crush'd heart felt blind and <mark3>sick.</mark3><br>
I made a footing in the <mark4>wall,</mark4><br>
It was not therefrom to <mark4>escape,</mark4><br>
For I had buried one and <mark3>all,</mark3><br>
Who loved me in a human <mark3>shape;</mark3><br>
And the whole earth would henceforth <mark1>be</mark1><br>
A wider prison unto <mark1>me:</mark1><br>
No child, no sire, no kin had <mark3>I,</mark3><br>
No partner in my <mark1>misery;</mark1><br>
I thought of this, and I was <mark4>glad,</mark4><br>
For thought of them had made me <mark3>mad;</mark3><br>
But I was curious to <mark4>ascend</mark4><br>
To my barr'd windows, and to <mark3>bend</mark3><br>
Once more, upon the mountains <mark1>high,</mark1><br>
The quiet of a loving <mark3>eye.</mark3><br>
<br>
I saw them?and they were the <mark3>same,</mark3><br>
They were not changed like me in <mark3>frame;</mark3><br>
I saw their thousand years of <mark3>snow</mark3><br>
On high?their wide long lake <mark1>below,</mark1><br>
And the blue Rhone in fullest <mark1>flow;</mark1><br>
I heard the torrents leap and <mark4>gush</mark4><br>
O'er channell'd rock and broken <mark4>bush;</mark4><br>
I saw the white-wall'd distant <mark4>town,</mark4><br>
And whiter sails go skimming <mark3>down;</mark3><br>
And then there was a little <mark4>isle,</mark4><br>
Which in my very face did <mark1>smile,</mark1><br>
The only one in <mark3>view;</mark3><br>
A small green isle, it seem'd no <mark1>more,</mark1><br>
Scarce broader than my dungeon <mark1>floor,</mark1><br>
But in it there were three tall <mark4>trees,</mark4><br>
And o'er it blew the mountain <mark3>breeze,</mark3><br>
And by it there were waters <mark4>flowing,</mark4><br>
And on it there were young flowers <mark3>growing,</mark3><br>
Of gentle breath and <mark3>hue.</mark3><br>
The fish swam by the castle <mark1>wall,</mark1><br>
And they seem'd joyous each and <mark1>all;</mark1><br>
The eagle rode the rising <mark4>blast,</mark4><br>
Methought he never flew so <mark3>fast</mark3><br>
As then to me he seem'd to <mark3>fly;</mark3><br>
And then new tears came in my <mark1>eye,</mark1><br>
And I felt troubled?and would <mark4>fain</mark4><br>
I had not left my recent <mark1>chain;</mark1><br>
And when I did descend <mark1>again,</mark1><br>
The darkness of my dim <mark4>abode</mark4><br>
Fell on me as a heavy <mark3>load;</mark3><br>
It was as is a new-dug <mark1>grave,</mark1><br>
Closing o'er one we sought to <mark3>save,?</mark3><br>
And yet my glance, too much opprest,<br>
Had almost need of such a <mark1>rest.</mark1><br>
<br>
It might be months, or <mark4>years</mark4>, or <mark1>days?</mark1><br>
I kept no <mark4>count</mark4>, I took no <mark4>note?</mark4><br>
I had no hope my eyes to <mark1>raise,</mark1><br>
And clear them of their dreary <mark3>mote;</mark3><br>
At last men came to set me <mark1>free;</mark1><br>
I ask'd not why, and reck'd not <mark4>where;</mark4><br>
It was at length the same to <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Fetter'd or fetterless to <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
I learn'd to love <mark3>despair.</mark3><br>
And thus when they appear'd at <mark1>last,</mark1><br>
And all my bonds aside were <mark1>cast,</mark1><br>
These heavy walls to me had <mark4>grown</mark4><br>
A hermitage?and all my <mark1>own!</mark1><br>
And half I felt as they were <mark4>come</mark4><br>
To tear me from a second <mark4>home:</mark4><br>
With spiders I had friendship <mark4>made</mark4><br>
And watch'd them in their sullen <mark3>trade,</mark3><br>
Had seen the mice by moonlight <mark3>play,</mark3><br>
And why should I feel less than <mark3>they?</mark3><br>
We were all inmates of one <mark1>place,</mark1><br>
And I, the monarch of each <mark1>race,</mark1><br>
Had power to kill?yet, strange to <mark4>tell!</mark4><br>
In quiet we had learn'd to <mark3>dwell;</mark3><br>
My very chains and I grew <mark4>friends,</mark4><br>
So much a long communion <mark3>tends</mark3><br>
To make us what we are:?even <mark1>I</mark1><br>
Regain'd my freedom with a <mark3>sigh.</mark3><br>
