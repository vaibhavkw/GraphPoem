Title : The Murder of William Remington <br>
Author : Howard Nemerov <br><br>

It is true, that even in the best-run <mark3>state</mark3><br>
Such things will happen; it is <mark3>true,</mark3><br>
What's done is done. The law, whereby we <mark3>hate</mark3><br>
Our hatred, sees no fire in the <mark3>flue</mark3><br>
But by the smoke, and not for thought <mark4>alone</mark4><br>
It punishes, but for the thing that's <mark4>done.</mark4><br>
<br>
And yet there is the horror of the <mark4>fact,</mark4><br>
Though we knew not the man. To die in <mark3>jail,</mark3><br>
To be beaten to death, to know the <mark3>act</mark3><br>
Of personal fury before the eyes can <mark3>fail</mark3><br>
And the man die against the cold last <mark4>wall</mark4><br>
Of the lonely world--and neither is that <mark3>all:</mark3><br>
<br>
There is the terror too of each man's <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
That knows <mark4>not</mark4>, but must quietly <mark4>suspect</mark4><br>
His neighbor, friend, or self of being <mark4>taught</mark4><br>
To take an attitude merely <mark4>correct;</mark4><br>
Being frightened of his own cold image <mark4>in</mark4><br>
The glass of government, and his own <mark3>sin,</mark3><br>
<br>
Frightened lest senate house and prison <mark1>wall</mark1><br>
Be quarried of one stone, lest righteous and high   <br>
Look faintly smiling down and seem to <mark3>call</mark3><br>
A crime the welcome chance of liberty,   <br>
And any man an outlaw who aggrieves   <br>
The patriotism of a pair of thieves.<br>
