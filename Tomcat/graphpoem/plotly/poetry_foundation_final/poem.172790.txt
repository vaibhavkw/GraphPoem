Author : Charles Wesley <br><br>

Hark! the herald Angels <mark3>sing,</mark3><br>
Glory to the new-born <mark3>King,</mark3><br>
Peace on earth and mercy <mark4>mild,</mark4><br>
God and sinner reconcil'd.<br>
Hark! the herald Angels <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
Glory to the new-born <mark1>King.</mark1><br>
<br>
Joyful all ye nations <mark3>rise,</mark3><br>
Join the triumph of the <mark3>skies,</mark3><br>
With the angelic host <mark4>proclaim,</mark4><br>
Christ is born in <mark4>Bethlehem.</mark4><br>
Hark! the herald Angels <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
Glory to the new-born <mark1>King.</mark1><br>
<br>
Christ by highest Heaven <mark4>ador'd,</mark4><br>
Christ the everlasting <mark4>Lord!</mark4><br>
Late in time behold him <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
Offspring of a virgin's <mark4>womb.</mark4><br>
Hark! the herald Angels <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
Glory to the new-born <mark1>King.</mark1><br>
<br>
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see,<br>
Hail, the incarnate Deity,<br>
Pleased as Man with man to <mark4>dwell,</mark4><br>
Jesus our <mark4>Immanuel!</mark4><br>
Hark! the herald Angels <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
Glory to the new-born <mark1>King.</mark1><br>
<br>
Hail the Heaven-born Prince of <mark4>Peace!</mark4><br>
Hail the Sun of <mark4>Righteousness!</mark4><br>
Light and life to all he <mark4>brings,</mark4><br>
Risen with healing in his <mark3>wings.</mark3><br>
Hark! the herald Angels <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
Glory to the new-born <mark1>King.</mark1><br>
<br>
Mild he lays his glory <mark3>by,</mark3><br>
Born that man no more may <mark3>die,</mark3><br>
Born to raise the sons of <mark3>earth,</mark3><br>
Born to give them second <mark3>birth.</mark3><br>
Hark! the herald Angels <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
Glory to the new-born <mark1>King.</mark1><br>
