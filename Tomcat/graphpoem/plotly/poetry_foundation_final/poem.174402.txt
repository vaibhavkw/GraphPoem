Title : One Sung of thee who Left the Tale Untold <br>
Author : Percy Bysshe Shelley <br><br>

One sung of thee who left the tale <mark3>untold,</mark3><br>
Like the false dawns which perish in the <mark3>bursting;</mark3><br>
Like empty cups of wrought and daedal <mark3>gold,</mark3><br>
Which mock the lips with air, when they are <mark3>thirsting.</mark3><br>
