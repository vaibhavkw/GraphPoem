Title : Of Old Sat Freedom on the Heights <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

Of old sat Freedom on the <mark3>heights,</mark3><br>
The thunders breaking at her <mark3>feet:</mark3><br>
Above her shook the starry <mark3>lights:</mark3><br>
She heard the torrents <mark3>meet.</mark3><br>
<br>
There in her place she did <mark4>rejoice,</mark4><br>
Self-gather'd in her <mark3>prophet-mind,</mark3><br>
But fragments of her mighty <mark3>voice</mark3><br>
Came rolling on the <mark3>wind.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then stept she down thro' town and <mark4>field</mark4><br>
To mingle with the human <mark4>race,</mark4><br>
And part by part to men <mark4>reveal'd</mark4><br>
The fulness of her <mark3>face?</mark3><br>
<br>
Grave mother of majestic <mark4>works,</mark4><br>
From her isle-altar gazing <mark3>down,</mark3><br>
Who, God-like, grasps the triple <mark4>forks,</mark4><br>
And, King-like, wears the <mark3>crown:</mark3><br>
<br>
Her open eyes desire the <mark3>truth.</mark3><br>
The wisdom of a thousand <mark4>years</mark4><br>
Is in them. May perpetual <mark3>youth</mark3><br>
Keep dry their light from <mark3>tears;</mark3><br>
<br>
That her fair form may stand and <mark4>shine,</mark4><br>
Make bright our days and light our <mark4>dreams,</mark4><br>
Turning to scorn with lips <mark3>divine</mark3><br>
The falsehood of <mark3>extremes!</mark3><br>
