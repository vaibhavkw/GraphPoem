Title : Count Gismond?Aix in Provence <br>
Author : Robert Browning <br><br>

Christ God who savest man, save <mark3>most</mark3><br>
      Of men Count Gismond who saved me!<br>
Count Gauthier, when he chose his <mark3>post,</mark3><br>
      Chose time and place and company<br>
To suit it; when he struck at <mark3>length</mark3><br>
My honour, 't was with all his <mark3>strength.</mark3><br>
<br>
And doubtlessly, ere he could <mark3>draw</mark3><br>
All points to one, he must have <mark3>schemed!</mark3><br>
That miserable morning <mark3>saw</mark3><br>
Few half so happy as I <mark3>seemed,</mark3><br>
While being dressed in queen's <mark3>array</mark3><br>
To give our tourney prize <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
<br>
I thought they loved me, did me <mark4>grace</mark4><br>
To please themselves; 't was all their <mark4>deed;</mark4><br>
God makes, or fair or foul, our <mark3>face;</mark3><br>
If showing mine so caused to <mark3>bleed</mark3><br>
My cousins' hearts, they should have <mark4>dropped</mark4><br>
A word, and straight the play had <mark3>stopped.</mark3><br>
<br>
They, too, so beauteous! Each a <mark3>queen</mark3><br>
By virtue of her brow and <mark4>breast;</mark4><br>
Not needing to be crowned, I <mark3>mean,</mark3><br>
As I do. E'en when I was <mark3>dressed,</mark3><br>
Had either of them spoke, <mark4>instead</mark4><br>
Of glancing sideways with still <mark3>head!</mark3><br>
<br>
But no: they let me laugh, and <mark3>sing</mark3><br>
My birthday song quite through, <mark4>adjust</mark4><br>
The last rose in my garland, <mark3>fling</mark3><br>
A last look on the mirror, <mark3>trust</mark3><br>
My arms to each an arm of <mark3>theirs,</mark3><br>
And so descend the <mark3>castle-stairs-</mark3><br>
<br>
And come out on the morning <mark3>troop</mark3><br>
Of merry friends who kissed my <mark3>cheek,</mark3><br>
And called me queen, and made me <mark3>stoop</mark3><br>
Under the canopy-(a <mark3>streak</mark3><br>
That pierced it, of the outside <mark4>sun,</mark4><br>
Powdered with gold its gloom's soft <mark3>dun)-</mark3><br>
<br>
And they could let me take my <mark4>state</mark4><br>
And foolish throne amid <mark4>applause</mark4><br>
Of all come there to <mark4>celebrate</mark4><br>
My queen's-day-Oh I think the <mark3>cause</mark3><br>
Of much was, they forgot no <mark4>crowd</mark4><br>
Makes up for parents in their <mark3>shroud!</mark3><br>
<br>
However that be, all eyes were <mark4>bent</mark4><br>
Upon me, when my cousins <mark4>cast</mark4><br>
Theirs down; 't was time I should <mark4>present</mark4><br>
The victor's crown, but ... there, 't will <mark4>last</mark4><br>
No long time ... the old mist <mark4>again</mark4><br>
Blinds me as then it did. How <mark3>vain!</mark3><br>
<br>
See! Gismond's at the gate, in <mark4>talk</mark4><br>
With his two boys: I can <mark4>proceed.</mark4><br>
Well, at that moment, who should <mark3>stalk</mark3><br>
Forth boldly-to my face, <mark3>indeed-</mark3><br>
But Gauthier? and he thundered <mark3>"Stay!"</mark3><br>
And all stayed. "Bring no crowns, I <mark3>say!</mark3><br>
<br>
"Bring torches! Wind the <mark4>penance-sheet</mark4><br>
"About her! Let her shun the <mark4>chaste,</mark4><br>
"Or lay herself before their <mark4>feet!</mark4><br>
"Shall she, whose body I <mark4>embraced</mark4><br>
"A night long, queen it in the <mark3>day?</mark3><br>
"For honour's sake no crowns, I <mark1>say!"</mark1><br>
<br>
I? What I answered? As I <mark3>live,</mark3><br>
I never fancied such a <mark3>thing</mark3><br>
As answer possible to <mark3>give.</mark3><br>
What says the body when they <mark3>spring</mark3><br>
Some monstrous torture-engine's <mark3>whole</mark3><br>
Strength on it? No more says the <mark3>soul.</mark3><br>
<br>
Till out strode Gismond; then I <mark3>knew</mark3><br>
That I was saved. I never <mark4>met</mark4><br>
His face before, but, at first <mark3>view,</mark3><br>
I felt quite sure that God had <mark3>set</mark3><br>
Himself to Satan; would who <mark4>spend</mark4><br>
A minute's mistrust on the <mark3>end?</mark3><br>
<br>
He strode to Gauthier, in his <mark4>throat</mark4><br>
Gave him the lie, then struck his <mark4>mouth</mark4><br>
With one back-handed blow that <mark3>wrote</mark3><br>
In blood men's verdict there. <mark4>North</mark4>, <mark3>South,</mark3><br>
East, West, I looked. The lie was <mark4>dead,</mark4><br>
And <mark4>damned</mark4>, and truth stood up <mark1>instead.</mark1><br>
<br>
This glads me most, that I <mark4>enjoyed</mark4><br>
The heart o' the joy, with my <mark4>content</mark4><br>
In watching Gismond <mark4>unalloyed</mark4><br>
By any doubt of the <mark3>event:</mark3><br>
God took that on him-I was <mark4>bid</mark4><br>
Watch Gismond for my part: I <mark3>did.</mark3><br>
<br>
Did I not watch him while he <mark4>let</mark4><br>
His armourer just brace his <mark4>greaves,</mark4><br>
Rivet his hauberk, on the <mark3>fret</mark3><br>
The while! His foot ... my memory <mark3>leaves</mark3><br>
No least stamp out nor how anon<br>
He pulled his ringing gauntlets <mark4>on.</mark4><br>
<br>
And e'en before the trumpet's <mark4>sound</mark4><br>
Was <mark4>finished</mark4>, prone lay the false <mark4>knight,</mark4><br>
Prone as his lie, upon the <mark3>ground:</mark3><br>
Gismond flew at him, used no <mark3>sleight</mark3><br>
O' the sword, but open-breasted <mark4>drove,</mark4><br>
Cleaving till out the truth he clove.<br>
<br>
Which done, he dragged him to my <mark1>feet</mark1><br>
And said, "Here die, but end thy <mark4>breath</mark4><br>
"In full confession, lest thou <mark3>fleet</mark3><br>
"From my first, to God's second <mark3>death!</mark3><br>
"Say, hast thou lied? <mark4>"And</mark4>, "I have <mark4>lied</mark4><br>
"To God and her,"he <mark4>said</mark4>, and <mark3>died.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then Gismond, kneeling to me, <mark4>asked</mark4><br>
-What safe my heart holds, though no <mark4>word</mark4><br>
Could I repeat now, if I <mark3>tasked</mark3><br>
My powers for ever, to a <mark3>third</mark3><br>
Dear even as you are. Pass the <mark4>rest</mark4><br>
Until I sank upon his <mark1>breast.</mark1><br>
<br>
Over my head his arm he <mark4>flung</mark4><br>
Against the world; and scarce I <mark4>felt</mark4><br>
His sword (that dripped by me and <mark3>swung)</mark3><br>
A little shifted in its <mark3>belt:</mark3><br>
For he began to say the <mark4>while</mark4><br>
How South our home lay many a <mark3>mile.</mark3><br>
<br>
So, 'mid the shouting <mark4>multitude</mark4><br>
We two walked forth to never <mark3>more</mark3><br>
Return. My cousins have <mark4>pursued</mark4><br>
Their life, untroubled as <mark3>before</mark3><br>
I vexed them. Gauthier's <mark3>dwelling-place</mark3><br>
God lighten! May his soul find <mark1>grace!</mark1><br>
<br>
Our elder boy has got the <mark4>clear</mark4><br>
Great brow, tho' when his brother's <mark4>black</mark4><br>
Full eye shows scorn, it ... Gismond <mark4>here?</mark4><br>
And have you brought my tercel <mark3>back?</mark3><br>
I was just telling Adela<br>
How many birds it struck since <mark3>May.</mark3><br>
