Title : III Mon. May [1734] hath xxxi days. <br>
Author : Benjamin Franklin <br><br>

Wedlock, as old Men note, hath likened <mark3>been,</mark3><br>
Unto a publick Crowd or common <mark3>Rout;</mark3><br>
Where those that are without would fain get <mark3>in,</mark3><br>
And those that are within would fain get <mark3>out.</mark3><br>
Grief often treads upon the Heels of <mark3>Pleasure,</mark3><br>
Marry'd in Haste, we oft repent at <mark3>Leisure;</mark3><br>
Some by Experience find these Words misplac'ed, <br>
Marry'd at Leisure, they repent in <mark4>Haste.</mark4><br>
