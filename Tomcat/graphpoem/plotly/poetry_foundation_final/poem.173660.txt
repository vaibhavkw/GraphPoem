Title : God's Grandeur <br>
Author : Gerard Manley Hopkins <br><br>

The world is charged with the grandeur of <mark3>God.</mark3><br>
It will flame out, like shining from shook <mark3>foil;</mark3><br>
It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of <mark3>oil</mark3><br>
Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his <mark3>rod?</mark3><br>
Generations have <mark1>trod</mark1>, have trod, have <mark3>trod;</mark3><br>
And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with <mark3>toil;</mark3><br>
And wears man's smudge and shares man's smell: the <mark3>soil</mark3><br>
Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being <mark3>shod.</mark3><br>
<br>
And for all this, nature is never <mark3>spent;</mark3><br>
There lives the dearest freshness deep down <mark3>things;</mark3><br>
And though the last lights off the black West <mark3>went</mark3><br>
Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs <mark3>--</mark3><br>
Because the Holy Ghost over the <mark3>bent</mark3><br>
World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright <mark3>wings.</mark3><br>
