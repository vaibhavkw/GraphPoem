Title : To Ben Jonson <br>
Author : Thomas Carew <br><br>

'Tis true, dear Ben, thy just chastising <mark3>hand</mark3><br>
Hath fix'd upon the sotted age a <mark3>brand</mark3><br>
To their swoll'n pride and empty scribbling <mark3>due;</mark3><br>
It can nor judge, nor write, and yet 'tis <mark3>true</mark3><br>
Thy comic muse, from the exalted <mark3>line</mark3><br>
Touch'd by thy Alchemist, doth since <mark3>decline</mark3><br>
From that her zenith, and foretells a <mark4>red</mark4><br>
And blushing evening, when she goes to <mark3>bed;</mark3><br>
Yet such as shall outshine the glimmering <mark3>light</mark3><br>
With which all stars shall gild the following <mark3>night.</mark3><br>
Nor think it much, since all thy eaglets <mark3>may</mark3><br>
Endure the sunny trial, if we <mark3>say</mark3><br>
This hath the stronger wing, or that doth <mark3>shine</mark3><br>
Trick'd up in fairer plumes, since all are <mark3>thine.</mark3><br>
Who hath his flock of cackling geese compar'd<br>
With thy tun'd choir of swans? or else who <mark4>dar'd</mark4><br>
To call thy births deform'd? But if thou <mark4>bind</mark4><br>
By city-custom, or by gavelkind,<br>
In equal shares thy love on all thy <mark3>race,</mark3><br>
We may distinguish of their <mark4>sex</mark4>, and <mark3>place;</mark3><br>
Though one hand form them, and though one brain <mark3>strike</mark3><br>
Souls into all, they are not all <mark3>alike.</mark3><br>
Why should the follies then of this dull <mark3>age</mark3><br>
Draw from thy pen such an immodest <mark3>rage</mark3><br>
As seems to blast thy else-immortal <mark4>bays,</mark4><br>
When thine own tongue proclaims thy itch of <mark3>praise?</mark3><br>
Such thirst will argue drouth. No, let be <mark4>hurl'd</mark4><br>
Upon thy works by the detracting <mark4>world</mark4><br>
What malice can suggest; let the rout <mark1>say,</mark1><br>
The running sands, that, ere thou make a <mark3>play,</mark3><br>
Count the slow minutes, might a Goodwin <mark3>frame</mark3><br>
To swallow, when th' hast done, thy shipwreck'd <mark3>name;</mark3><br>
Let them the dear expense of oil <mark4>upbraid,</mark4><br>
Suck'd by thy watchful lamp, that hath <mark4>betray'd</mark4><br>
To theft the blood of martyr'd authors, <mark4>spilt</mark4><br>
Into thy ink, whilst thou growest pale with <mark3>guilt.</mark3><br>
Repine not at the taper's thrifty <mark4>waste,</mark4><br>
That sleeks thy terser poems; nor is <mark3>haste</mark3><br>
Praise, but excuse; and if thou <mark4>overcome</mark4><br>
A knotty writer, bring the booty <mark4>home;</mark4><br>
Nor think it theft if the rich spoils so <mark4>torn</mark4><br>
From conquer'd authors be as trophies <mark3>worn.</mark3><br>
Let others glut on the extorted <mark1>praise</mark1><br>
Of vulgar breath, trust thou to <mark3>after-days;</mark3><br>
Thy labour'd works shall live when time <mark4>devours</mark4><br>
Th' abortive offspring of their hasty <mark3>hours.</mark3><br>
Thou are not of their rank, the quarrel <mark4>lies</mark4><br>
Within thine own verge; then let this <mark4>suffice,</mark4><br>
The wiser world doth greater thee <mark4>confess</mark4><br>
Than all men <mark4>else</mark4>, than thyself only <mark3>less.</mark3><br>
