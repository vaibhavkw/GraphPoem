Title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 118 <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

Contemplate all this work of <mark3>Time,</mark3><br>
The giant labouring in his <mark3>youth;</mark3><br>
Nor dream of human love and <mark3>truth,</mark3><br>
As dying Nature's earth and <mark3>lime;</mark3><br>
<br>
But trust that those we call the <mark3>dead</mark3><br>
Are breathers of an ampler <mark3>day</mark3><br>
For ever nobler ends. They <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
The solid earth whereon we <mark3>tread</mark3><br>
<br>
In tracts of fluent heat <mark3>began,</mark3><br>
And grew to seeming-random <mark3>forms,</mark3><br>
The seeming prey of cyclic <mark3>storms,</mark3><br>
Till at the last arose the <mark3>man;</mark3><br>
<br>
Who throve and branch'd from clime to clime, <br>
The herald of a higher <mark3>race,</mark3><br>
And of himself in higher <mark3>place,</mark3><br>
If so he type this work of <mark1>time</mark1><br>
<br>
Within himself, from more to <mark3>more;</mark3><br>
Or, crown'd with attributes of <mark3>woe</mark3><br>
Like glories, move his course, and <mark3>show</mark3><br>
That life is not as idle <mark3>ore,</mark3><br>
<br>
But iron dug from central <mark4>gloom,</mark4><br>
And heated hot with burning <mark4>fears,</mark4><br>
And dipt in baths of hissing <mark3>tears,</mark3><br>
And batter'd with the shocks of <mark3>doom</mark3><br>
<br>
To shape and use. Arise and <mark3>fly</mark3><br>
The reeling Faun, the sensual <mark5>feast;</mark5><br>
Move upward, working out the <mark3>beast,</mark3><br>
And let the ape and tiger <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
