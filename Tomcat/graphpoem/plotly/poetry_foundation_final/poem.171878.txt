All the way north on the train the <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
followed me followed me without <mark4>moving</mark4><br>
still the sun of that other <mark4>morning</mark4><br>
when we had gone over Come on <mark4>over</mark4><br>
men at the screen door said to my <mark4>father</mark4><br>
You have to see this it's an ape <mark4>bring</mark4><br>
the little boy bring the boy <mark4>along</mark4><br>
<br>
so he brought me along to the <mark4>field</mark4><br>
of dry grass hissing behind the <mark4>houses</mark4><br>
in the heat that morning and there <mark4>was</mark4><br>
nothing else back there but the empty <mark3>day</mark3><br>
above the grass waving as far <mark3>away</mark3><br>
as I could see and the sight burned my <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
white birds were flying off beyond <mark4>us</mark4><br>
<br>
and a raised floor of boards like a <mark4>house</mark4><br>
with no house on it part way out <mark4>there</mark4><br>
was shining by itself a <mark4>color</mark4><br>
of shadow and the voices of the <mark4>men</mark4><br>
were smaller in the field as we walked <mark4>on</mark4><br>
something was standing out there on the <mark4>floor</mark4><br>
the men kept saying Come on <mark1>over</mark1><br>
<br>
it's on a chain and my father <mark4>said</mark4><br>
to me Don't get too close I saw it <mark1>was</mark1><br>
staring down at each of our <mark4>faces</mark4><br>
one after the other as though it might   <br>
catch sight of something in one of <mark5>them</mark5><br>
that it remembered I stood watching its <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
as they turned away from each of <mark1>us</mark1><br>
