Title : Graciela <br>
Author : Gary Soto <br><br>

Wedding <mark4>night</mark4><br>
Graciela bled <mark4>lightly?</mark4><br>
But enough to stain his <mark4>thighs?</mark4><br>
And left an <mark4>alphabet</mark4><br>
Of teeth marks on his arm. <br>
At this, he was <mark4>happy.</mark4><br>
They drank mescal<br>
In bed like the rich<br>
And smoked cigarettes.<br>
She asleep<br>
And the bottle empty, he <mark4>hid</mark4><br>
A few coins in her left shoe, <br>
Earrings in the <mark4>right.</mark4><br>
They worked long <mark4>hours</mark4><br>
Hoeing crooked rows of <mark4>maize.</mark4><br>
Evenings she wove <mark4>rugs</mark4><br>
And embroidered <mark4>curtains</mark4><br>
To market in Taxco.<br>
In short they lived well. <br>
However in the seventh month <br>
With child, her <mark4>belly</mark4><br>
Rising like a portion of the <mark4>sun,</mark4><br>
Something knotted inside her. <br>
The ribs ached. A fever <mark4>climbed.</mark4><br>
Manuel summoned the Partera <br>
And though she burned pepper, <br>
And tied belts <mark4>around</mark4><br>
The stretched <mark1>belly,</mark1><br>
The child did not ease <mark4>out.</mark4><br>
Days later she <mark4>turned</mark4><br>
Onto her <mark1>belly</mark1><br>
And between her <mark4>legs</mark4><br>
Unraveled a spine of <mark4>blood.</mark4><br>
