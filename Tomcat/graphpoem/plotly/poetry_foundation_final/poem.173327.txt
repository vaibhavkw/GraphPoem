Title : Delia 31: Look, Delia, how we 'steem the half-blown rose (1592 version) <br>
Author : Samuel Daniel <br><br>

<br>
Look, Delia, how we 'steem the half-blown <mark3>rose,</mark3><br>
The image of thy blush and summer's honour,<br>
Whilst in her tender green she doth <mark3>enclose</mark3><br>
That pure sweet beauty time bestows upon her.<br>
No sooner spreads her glory in the <mark3>air</mark3><br>
But straight her full-blown pride is in <mark3>declining;</mark3><br>
She then is scorn'd that late adorn'd the <mark3>fair:</mark3><br>
So clouds thy beauty after fairest <mark3>shining.</mark3><br>
No April can revive thy wither'd <mark4>flowers,</mark4><br>
Whose blooming grace adorns thy beauty <mark3>now;</mark3><br>
Swift speedy time, feather'd with flying <mark3>hours,</mark3><br>
Dissolves the beauty of the fairest <mark3>brow.</mark3><br>
O let not then such riches waste in <mark3>vain,</mark3><br>
But love whilst that thou mayst be lov'd <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
