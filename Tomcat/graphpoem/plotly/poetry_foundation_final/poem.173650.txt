Title : The Two Streams <br>
Author : Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. <br><br>

Behold the rocky <mark3>wall</mark3><br>
That down its sloping <mark3>sides</mark3><br>
Pours the swift rain-drops, blending, as they <mark3>fall,</mark3><br>
In rushing <mark3>river-tides!</mark3><br>
<br>
Yon stream, whose sources <mark3>run</mark3><br>
Turned by a pebble's <mark3>edge,</mark3><br>
Is Athabasca, rolling toward the <mark3>sun</mark3><br>
Through the cleft <mark3>mountain-ledge.</mark3><br>
<br>
The slender rill had <mark3>strayed,</mark3><br>
But for the slanting <mark4>stone,</mark4><br>
To evening's ocean, with the tangled <mark3>braid</mark3><br>
Of foam-flecked <mark4>Oregon.</mark4><br>
<br>
So from the heights of <mark4>Will</mark4><br>
Life's parting stream <mark4>descends,</mark4><br>
And, as a moment turns its slender <mark3>rill,</mark3><br>
Each widening torrent <mark3>bends,--</mark3><br>
<br>
From the same cradle's <mark4>side,</mark4><br>
From the same mother's <mark3>knee,--</mark3><br>
One to long darkness and the frozen <mark3>tide,</mark3><br>
One to the Peaceful <mark3>Sea!</mark3><br>
