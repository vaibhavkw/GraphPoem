Title : Let It Be Forgotten <br>
Author : Sara Teasdale <br><br>

Let it be <mark1>forgotten</mark1>, as a flower is <mark1>forgotten,</mark1><br>
Forgotten as a fire that once was singing <mark3>gold,</mark3><br>
Let it be forgotten for ever and ever, <br>
Time is a kind <mark4>friend</mark4>, he will make us <mark3>old.</mark3><br>
<br>
If anyone asks, say it was <mark1>forgotten</mark1><br>
Long and long <mark3>ago,</mark3><br>
As a flower, as a fire, as a hushed footfall <br>
In a long forgotten <mark3>snow.</mark3><br>
