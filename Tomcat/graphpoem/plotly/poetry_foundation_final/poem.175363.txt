I: THE MOTOR: 1905 <br>
<br>
From hedgerows where aromas fain would <mark3>be</mark3><br>
New volleyed odours execrably <mark3>arise;</mark3><br>
The flocks, with hell-smoke in their patient <mark3>eyes,</mark3><br>
Into the ditch from bawling ruin <mark3>flee:</mark3><br>
Spindrift of one abominated <mark3>sea</mark3><br>
Along all roads in wrecking fury <mark3>flies</mark3><br>
Till on young strangled leaf, on bloom that <mark3>dies,</mark3><br>
In this far plot it writes a rune for <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
<br>
Vast intimate tyranny! Nature <mark3>dispossessed</mark3><br>
Helplessly hates thee, whose symbolic <mark3>flare</mark3><br>
Lights up (with what reiterance unblest!) <br>
Entrails of horror in a world thought <mark3>fair.</mark3><br>
False God of pastime thou, vampire of <mark3>rest,</mark3><br>
Augur of what pollution, what <mark3>despair?</mark3><br>
