Title : The Net<br>
Author : Babette Deutsch<br><br>

Into this net of leaves, green as old glass   <br>
That the sun fondles, trembling like <mark4>images</mark4><br>
<br>
In water, this live net, swung <mark3>overhead</mark3><br>
From branch to branch, what swam? The spider's <mark3>thread</mark3><br>
<br>
Is less passive, where it appears to <mark3>float</mark3><br>
Like a bright hair clinging to the wind's <mark3>coat.</mark3><br>
<br>
Hot at work, history neither schemes nor <mark4>grieves</mark4><br>
Here where the soaking dead are last year's <mark3>leaves,</mark3><br>
<br>
And over them slung, meshed with sun, a <mark4>net</mark4><br>
No creature wove, none frantically tried to <mark3>fret.</mark3><br>
<br>
The huge weight of time without its <mark3>sting</mark3><br>
Hangs in that greenly cradling woof. A <mark3>wing</mark3><br>
<br>
Has caught there, held. Held. But not to <mark3>stay,</mark3><br>
We know, who, how slowly, walk <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
