Title : In the Bay <br>
Author : Algernon Charles Swinburne <br><br>

<br>
Beyond the hollow sunset, ere a <mark3>star</mark3><br>
Take heart in heaven from eastward, while the <mark3>west,</mark3><br>
Fulfilled of watery resonance and <mark3>rest,</mark3><br>
Is as a port with clouds for harbour <mark3>bar</mark3><br>
To fold the fleet in of the winds from <mark3>far</mark3><br>
That stir no plume now of the bland sea's <mark3>breast:</mark3><br>
<br>
Above the soft sweep of the breathless <mark3>bay</mark3><br>
Southwestward, far past flight of night and <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
Lower than the sunken sunset sinks, and <mark3>higher</mark3><br>
Than dawn can freak the front of heaven with <mark3>fire,</mark3><br>
My thought with eyes and wings made wide makes <mark3>way</mark3><br>
To find the place of souls that I <mark3>desire.</mark3><br>
If any place for any soul there <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
<br>
Disrobed and disentrammelled; if the <mark4>might,</mark4><br>
The fire and force that filled with ardent <mark3>light</mark3><br>
The souls whose shadow is half the light we <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
Survive and be suppressed not of the <mark3>night;</mark3><br>
This hour should show what all day hid from <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
Night knows not, neither is it shown to <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
By sunlight nor by starlight is it <mark3>shown,</mark3><br>
<br>
Nor to the full moon's eye nor footfall <mark3>known,</mark3><br>
Their world's untrodden and unkindled <mark1>way.</mark1><br>
Nor is the breath nor music of it <mark3>blown</mark3><br>
With sounds of winter or with winds of <mark3>May.</mark3><br>
But here, where light and darkness <mark4>reconciled</mark4><br>
Held earth between them as a weanling <mark4>child</mark4><br>
Between the balanced hands of death and <mark3>birth,</mark3><br>
<br>
Even as they held the new-born shape of <mark3>earth</mark3><br>
When first life trembled in her limbs and <mark3>smiled,</mark3><br>
Here hope might think to find what hope were <mark3>worth.</mark3><br>
Past Hades, past Elysium, past the <mark3>long</mark3><br>
Slow smooth strong lapse of Lethe--past the <mark3>toil</mark3><br>
Wherein all souls are taken as a <mark3>spoil,</mark3><br>
The Stygian web of waters--if your <mark3>song</mark3><br>
<br>
Be quenched not, O our brethren, but be <mark3>strong</mark3><br>
As ere ye too shook off our temporal <mark3>coil;</mark3><br>
If yet these twain survive your worldly <mark4>breath,</mark4><br>
Joy trampling sorrow, life devouring <mark3>death,</mark3><br>
If perfect life possess your life all <mark3>through</mark3><br>
And like your words your souls be deathless <mark3>too,</mark3><br>
To-night, of all whom night encompasseth, <br>
<br>
My soul would commune with one soul of <mark3>you.</mark3><br>
Above the sunset might I see thine <mark3>eyes</mark3><br>
That were above the sundawn in our <mark3>skies,</mark3><br>
Son of the songs of morning,--thine that were <br>
First lights to lighten that rekindling <mark4>air</mark4><br>
Wherethrough men saw the front of England <mark3>rise</mark3><br>
And heard thine loudest of the lyre-notes <mark3>there--</mark3><br>
<br>
If yet thy fire have not one spark the <mark4>less,</mark4><br>
O Titan, born of her a Titaness, <br>
Across the sunrise and the sunset's <mark3>mark</mark3><br>
Send of thy lyre one sound, thy fire one <mark3>spark,</mark3><br>
To change this face of our unworthiness, <br>
Across this hour dividing light from <mark3>dark.</mark3><br>
To change this face of our chill time, that <mark4>hears</mark4><br>
<br>
No song like thine of all that crowd its <mark3>ears,</mark3><br>
Of all its lights that lighten all day <mark1>long</mark1><br>
Sees none like thy most fleet and fiery <mark3>sphere's</mark3><br>
Outlightening Sirius--in its twilight <mark3>throng</mark3><br>
No thunder and no sunrise like thy <mark1>song.</mark1><br>
Hath not the sea-wind swept the sea-line <mark3>bare</mark3><br>
To pave with stainless fire through stainless <mark1>air</mark1><br>
<br>
A passage for thine heavenlier feet to <mark4>tread</mark4><br>
Ungrieved of earthly floor-work? hath it <mark3>spread</mark3><br>
No covering splendid as the sun-god's <mark3>hair</mark3><br>
To veil or to reveal thy lordlier <mark3>head?</mark3><br>
Hath not the sunset strewn across the <mark3>sea</mark3><br>
A way majestical enough for <mark3>thee?</mark3><br>
What hour save this should be thine hour--and <mark4>mine,</mark4><br>
<br>
If thou have care of any less <mark3>divine</mark3><br>
Than thine own soul; if thou take thought of <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Marlowe, as all my soul takes thought of <mark3>thine?</mark3><br>
Before the morn's face as before the <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
The morning star and evening star are <mark3>one</mark3><br>
For all men's lands as England. O, if <mark1>night</mark1><br>
Hang hard upon us,--ere our day take <mark3>flight,</mark3><br>
<br>
Shed thou some comfort from thy day long <mark3>done</mark3><br>
On us pale children of the latter <mark1>light!</mark1><br>
For surely, brother and master and lord and <mark4>king,</mark4><br>
Where'er thy footfall and thy face make <mark3>spring</mark3><br>
In all souls' eyes that meet thee wheresoe'er, <br>
And have thy soul for sunshine and sweet <mark1>air--</mark1><br>
Some late love of thine old live land should <mark3>cling,</mark3><br>
<br>
Some living love of England, round thee <mark1>there.</mark1><br>
Here from her shore across her sunniest <mark1>sea</mark1><br>
My soul makes question of the sun for <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
And waves and beams make answer. When thy <mark4>feet</mark4><br>
Made her ways flowerier and their flowers more <mark3>sweet</mark3><br>
With childlike passage of a god to <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
Like spray these waves cast off her foemen's <mark3>fleet.</mark3><br>
<br>
Like foam they flung it from her, and like <mark4>weed</mark4><br>
Its wrecks were washed from scornful shoal to <mark5>shoal,</mark5><br>
From rock to rock reverberate; and the <mark4>whole</mark4><br>
Sea laughed and lightened with a deathless <mark3>deed</mark3><br>
That sowed our enemies in her field for <mark3>seed</mark3><br>
And made her shores fit harbourage for thy <mark3>soul.</mark3><br>
Then in her green south fields, a poor man's <mark1>child,</mark1><br>
<br>
Thou hadst thy short sweet fill of half-blown <mark3>joy,</mark3><br>
That ripens all of us for time to <mark3>cloy</mark3><br>
With full-blown pain and passion; ere the <mark3>wild</mark3><br>
World caught thee by the fiery heart, and <mark1>smiled</mark1><br>
To make so swift end of the godlike <mark3>boy.</mark3><br>
For thou, if ever godlike foot there <mark4>trod</mark4><br>
These fields of ours, wert surely like a <mark3>god.</mark3><br>
<br>
Who knows what splendour of strange dreams was <mark4>shed</mark4><br>
With sacred shadow and glimmer of gold and <mark3>red</mark3><br>
From hallowed windows, over stone and <mark4>sod,</mark4><br>
On thine unbowed bright insubmissive <mark1>head?</mark1><br>
The shadow stayed not, but the splendour <mark4>stays,</mark4><br>
Our brother, till the last of English <mark3>days.</mark3><br>
No day nor night on English earth shall <mark1>be</mark1><br>
<br>
For ever, spring nor summer, Junes nor <mark3>Mays,</mark3><br>
But somewhat as a sound or gleam of <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
Shall come on us like morning from the <mark1>sea.</mark1><br>
Like sunrise never wholly risen, nor <mark4>yet</mark4><br>
Quenched; or like sunset never wholly <mark3>set,</mark3><br>
A light to lighten as from living <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
The cold unlit close lids of one that <mark3>lies</mark3><br>
<br>
Dead, or a ray returned from death's far <mark1>skies</mark1><br>
To fire us living lest our lives <mark3>forget.</mark3><br>
For in that heaven what light of lights may <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
What splendour of what stars, what spheres of <mark3>flame</mark3><br>
Sounding, that none may number nor may <mark3>name,</mark3><br>
We know not, even thy brethren; yea, not <mark3>we</mark3><br>
Whose eyes desire the light that lightened <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
<br>
Whose ways and thine are one way and the <mark3>same.</mark3><br>
But if the riddles that in sleep we <mark3>read,</mark3><br>
And trust them not, be flattering truth <mark3>indeed,</mark3><br>
As he that rose our mightiest called <mark5>them,--he,</mark5><br>
Much higher than thou as thou much higher than <mark1>we--</mark1><br>
There, might we say, all flower of all our <mark1>seed,</mark1><br>
All singing souls are as one sounding <mark1>sea.</mark1><br>
<br>
All those that here were of thy kind and <mark4>kin,</mark4><br>
Beside thee and below thee, full of <mark3>love,</mark3><br>
Full-souled for song,--and one alone <mark3>above</mark3><br>
Whose only light folds all your glories <mark3>in--</mark3><br>
With all birds' notes from nightingale to <mark3>dove</mark3><br>
Fill the world whither we too fain would <mark3>win.</mark3><br>
The world that sees in heaven the sovereign <mark1>light</mark1><br>
<br>
Of sunlike Shakespeare, and the fiery <mark1>night</mark1><br>
Whose stars were watched of Webster; and <mark4>beneath,</mark4><br>
The twin-souled brethren of the single <mark3>wreath,</mark3><br>
Grown in kings' gardens, plucked from pastoral <mark3>heath,</mark3><br>
Wrought with all flowers for all men's heart's <mark3>delight.</mark3><br>
And that fixed fervour, iron-red like <mark4>Mars,</mark4><br>
In the mid moving tide of tenderer <mark3>stars,</mark3><br>
<br>
That burned on loves and deeds the darkest <mark1>done,</mark1><br>
Athwart the incestuous prisoner's bride-house <mark3>bars;</mark3><br>
And <mark4>thine</mark4>, most highest of all their fires but <mark1>one,</mark1><br>
Our morning star, sole risen before the <mark1>sun.</mark1><br>
And one light risen since theirs to run such <mark4>race</mark4><br>
Thou hast seen, O Phosphor, from thy pride of <mark3>place.</mark3><br>
Thou hast seen Shelley, him that was to <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
<br>
As light to fire or dawn to lightning; <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Me likewise, O our brother, shalt thou <mark1>see,</mark1><br>
And I behold thee, face to glorious <mark3>face?</mark3><br>
You twain the same swift year of manhood <mark4>swept</mark4><br>
Down the steep darkness, and our father <mark3>wept.</mark3><br>
And from the gleam of Apollonian <mark4>tears</mark4><br>
A holier aureole rounds your memories, <mark3>kept</mark3><br>
<br>
Most fervent-fresh of all the singing <mark3>spheres,</mark3><br>
And April-coloured through all months and <mark3>years.</mark3><br>
You twain fate spared not half your fiery <mark4>span;</mark4><br>
The longer date fulfils the lesser <mark3>man.</mark3><br>
Ye from beyond the dark dividing <mark4>date</mark4><br>
Stand smiling, crowned as gods with foot on <mark3>fate.</mark3><br>
For stronger was your blessing than his <mark3>ban,</mark3><br>
<br>
And earliest whom he struck, he struck too <mark3>late.</mark3><br>
Yet love and loathing, faith and unfaith <mark1>yet</mark1><br>
Bind less to greater souls in <mark4>unison,</mark4><br>
And one desire that makes three spirits as <mark1>one</mark1><br>
Takes great and small as in one spiritual <mark3>net</mark3><br>
Woven out of hope toward what shall yet be <mark1>done</mark1><br>
Ere hate or love remember or <mark1>forget.</mark1><br>
<br>
Woven out of faith and hope and love too <mark4>great</mark4><br>
To bear the bonds of life and death and <mark1>fate:</mark1><br>
Woven out of love and hope and faith too <mark4>dear</mark4><br>
To take the print of doubt and change and <mark3>fear:</mark3><br>
And interwoven with lines of wrath and <mark3>hate</mark3><br>
Blood-red with soils of many a sanguine <mark3>year.</mark3><br>
Who cannot hate, can love not; if he <mark4>grieve,</mark4><br>
<br>
His tears are barren as the unfruitful <mark4>rain</mark4><br>
That rears no harvest from the green sea's <mark3>plain,</mark3><br>
And as thorns crackling this man's laugh is <mark3>vain.</mark3><br>
Nor can belief touch, kindle, smite, <mark3>reprieve</mark3><br>
His heart who has not heart to <mark3>disbelieve.</mark3><br>
But you, most perfect in your hate and <mark1>love,</mark1><br>
Our great twin-spirited brethren; you that <mark4>stand</mark4><br>
<br>
Head by head glittering, hand made fast in <mark3>hand,</mark3><br>
And underfoot the fang-drawn worm that <mark4>strove</mark4><br>
To wound you living; from so far <mark1>above,</mark1><br>
Look love, not scorn, on ours that was your <mark3>land.</mark3><br>
For love we lack, and help and heat and <mark1>light</mark1><br>
To clothe us and to comfort us with <mark1>might.</mark1><br>
What help is ours to take or give? but <mark3>ye--</mark3><br>
<br>
O, more than sunrise to the blind cold <mark1>sea,</mark1><br>
That wailed aloud with all her waves all <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
Much more, being much more glorious, should you <mark1>be.</mark1><br>
As fire to frost, as ease to toil, as <mark3>dew</mark3><br>
To flowerless fields, as sleep to slackening <mark3>pain,</mark3><br>
As hope to souls long weaned from hope <mark3>again</mark3><br>
Returning, or as blood revived <mark3>anew</mark3><br>
<br>
To dry-drawn limbs and every pulseless <mark3>vein,</mark3><br>
Even so toward us should no man be but <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
One rose before the sunrise was, and <mark1>one</mark1><br>
Before the sunset, lovelier than the <mark1>sun.</mark1><br>
And now the heaven is dark and bright and <mark4>loud</mark4><br>
With wind and starry drift and moon and <mark3>cloud,</mark3><br>
And night's cry rings in straining sheet and <mark3>shroud,</mark3><br>
<br>
What help is ours if hope like yours be <mark3>none?</mark3><br>
O well-beloved, our brethren, if ye <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
Then are we not forsaken. This kind <mark1>earth</mark1><br>
Made fragrant once for all time with your <mark1>birth,</mark1><br>
And bright for all men with your love, and <mark1>worth</mark1><br>
The clasp and kiss and wedlock of the <mark1>sea,</mark1><br>
Were not your mother if not your brethren <mark1>we.</mark1><br>
<br>
Because the days were dark with gods and <mark4>kings</mark4><br>
And in time's hand the old hours of time as <mark4>rods,</mark4><br>
When force and fear set hope and faith at <mark3>odds,</mark3><br>
Ye failed not nor abased your plume-plucked <mark4>wings;</mark4><br>
And we that front not more disastrous <mark3>things,</mark3><br>
How should we fail in face of kings and <mark4>gods?</mark4><br>
For now the deep dense plumes of night are <mark4>thinned</mark4><br>
<br>
Surely with winnowing of the glimmering <mark3>wind</mark3><br>
Whose feet we fledged with morning; and the <mark1>breath</mark1><br>
Begins in heaven that sings the dark to <mark1>death.</mark1><br>
And all the night wherein men groaned and <mark3>sinned</mark3><br>
Sickens at heart to hear what sundawn saith. <br>
O first-born sons of hope and fairest, <mark1>ye</mark1><br>
Whose prows first clove the thought-unsounded <mark1>sea</mark1><br>
<br>
Whence all the dark dead centuries rose to <mark1>bar</mark1><br>
The spirit of man lest truth should make him <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
The sunrise and the sunset, seeing one <mark1>star,</mark1><br>
Take heart as we to know you that ye <mark3>are.</mark3><br>
Ye rise not and ye set not; we that <mark3>say</mark3><br>
Ye rise and set like hopes that set and <mark1>rise</mark1><br>
Look yet but seaward from a land-locked <mark1>bay;</mark1><br>
<br>
But where at last the sea's line is the <mark3>sky's</mark3><br>
And truth and hope one sunlight in your <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
No sunrise and no sunset marks their <mark1>day.</mark1><br>
