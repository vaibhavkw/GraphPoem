Title : On Virtue <br>
Author : Phillis Wheatley <br><br>

O thou bright jewel in my aim I <mark4>strive</mark4><br>
To comprehend thee. Thine own words <mark3>declare</mark3><br>
Wisdom is higher than a fool can reach.<br>
I cease to wonder, and no more attempt<br>
Thine height t'explore, or fathom thy <mark4>profound.</mark4><br>
But, O my soul, sink not into <mark3>despair,</mark3><br>
Virtue is near thee, and with gentle <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
Would now embrace thee, hovers o'er thine <mark4>head.</mark4><br>
Fain would the heaven-born soul with her <mark4>converse,</mark4><br>
Then seek, then court her for her promised <mark4>bliss.</mark4><br>
<br>
Auspicious queen, thine heavenly pinions <mark3>spread,</mark3><br>
And lead celestial Chastity along;<br>
Lo! now her sacred retinue <mark5>descends,</mark5><br>
Arrayed in glory from the orbs <mark4>above.</mark4><br>
Attend me, Virtue, thro' my youthful <mark4>years!</mark4><br>
O leave me not to the false joys of time!<br>
But guide my steps to endless life and <mark1>bliss.</mark1><br>
Greatness, or Goodness, say what I shall call thee,<br>
To give an higher appellation still,<br>
Teach me a better strain, a nobler <mark3>lay,</mark3><br>
O Thou, enthroned with Cherubs in the realms of <mark3>day!</mark3><br>
