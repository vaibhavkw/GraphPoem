Title : Young Woman <br>
Author : Howard Nemerov <br><br>

Naked before the glass she <mark3>said,</mark3><br>
"I see my body as no man has,   <br>
Nor any shall unless I <mark3>wed</mark3><br>
And naked in a stranger's <mark4>house</mark4><br>
Stand timid beside his <mark3>bed.</mark3><br>
There is no pity in the <mark4>flesh."</mark4><br>
<br>
"Or else I shall grow <mark4>old,</mark4>, she <mark1>said,</mark1><br>
"Alone, and change my likeliness   <br>
For a vile, slack shape, a <mark3>head</mark3><br>
Shriveled with thinking <mark4>wickedness</mark4><br>
Against the day I must be <mark3>dead</mark3><br>
And eaten by my crabbed <mark4>wish."</mark4><br>
<br>
"One or the other way," she <mark1>said,</mark1><br>
"How shall I know the <mark4>difference,</mark4><br>
When wrinkles come, to spinster or <mark4>bride?</mark4><br>
Whether to marry or burn is <mark4>bless-</mark4><br>
ed best, O stranger to my <mark1>bed,</mark1><br>
There is no pity in the <mark1>flesh."</mark1><br>
