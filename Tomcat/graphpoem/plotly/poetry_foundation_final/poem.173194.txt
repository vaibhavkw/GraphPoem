(excerpt)  From Book II<br>
With this he took his leve, and hom he <mark4>wente;</mark4><br>
And lord, so he was glad and wel bygon! <br>
Criseyde aroos, no lenger she ne <mark5>stente,</mark5><br>
But streght in-to hire closet wente <mark5>anon,</mark5><br>
And set hire doun as stylle as any ston, <br>
And every word gan up and doun to wynde, <br>
That he hadde seyd, as it com hire to <mark5>mynde;</mark5><br>
<br>
And wex somdel aston ed in hire <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
Right for the newe cas; but whan that <mark3>she</mark3><br>
Was ful avysed, tho fond she right nought <br>
Of peril, why she ought afered <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
For man may love, of possibilite, <br>
A womman so, his herte may to-breste, <br>
And she naught love ayein, but-if hire leste. <br>
<br>
But as she sat allone and thought e <mark1>thus,</mark1><br>
Ascry aroos at scarmuch al with-oute, <br>
And men cryde in the strete, "Se, <mark5>Troilus</mark5><br>
Hath right now put to flighte the Grekes <mark4>route!"</mark4><br>
With that gan al hire meynee for to shoute, <br>
"A! go we see; caste up the latis wyde; <br>
For thorugh this strete he moot to paleys ryde; <br>
<br>
"For other wey is fro the yat e <mark4>noon</mark4><br>
Of Dardanus, ther opyn is the <mark4>cheyne."</mark4><br>
With that com he and al his folk <mark5>anoon</mark5><br>
An esy pas rydynge, in routes tweyne, <br>
Right as his happy day was, sooth to seyne, <br>
For which, men seyn, may nought distourbed <mark1>be</mark1><br>
That shal bityden of necessitee. <br>
<br>
This Troilus sat on his bay e <mark5>steede,</mark5><br>
Al armed, save his hed, ful richely, <br>
And wownded was his hors, and gan to blede, <br>
On whiche he rood a pas, ful softely, <br>
But swych a knyghtly sighte, trewely, <br>
As was on hym was nought, withouten faille, <br>
To loke on Mars, that god is of bataille. <br>
<br>
So lik a man of arm es and a knyght <br>
He was to seen, fulfilled of heigh <mark1>prowesse;</mark1><br>
For bothe he hadde a body and a myght <br>
To doon that thing, as wel as hardynesse; <br>
And eek to seen hym in his gere hym <mark5>dresse,</mark5><br>
So fressh, so yong, so weldy semed <mark3>he,</mark3><br>
It was an heven up-on hym for to <mark3>see.</mark3><br>
<br>
His helm to-hewen was in twenty <mark4>places,</mark4><br>
That by a tyssew heng, his bak byhynde; <br>
His sheld to-dasshed was with swerdes and maces, <br>
In which men myghte many an arwe fynde<br>
That thirl ed hadde horn and nerf and rynde; <br>
And ay the peple cryde, "Here cometh oure joye, <br>
And, next his brother, holder up of <mark5>Troye!"</mark5><br>
<br>
For which he wex a litel reed for <mark3>shame,</mark3><br>
Whan he the peple up-on hym herde cryen, <br>
That to byholde it was a noble <mark3>game,</mark3><br>
How sobreliche he caste doun his <mark4>yen.</mark4><br>
Cryseyda gan al his chere aspien, <br>
And leet it so softe yn hir herte synke, <br>
That to hireself she seyde, "Who yaf me drynke?" <br>
<br>
For of hire owen thought she wex al <mark3>reed,</mark3><br>
Remembryng hire right thus, "Lo, this is <mark1>he</mark1><br>
Which that myn uncle swerith he moot be <mark3>deed,</mark3><br>
But I on hym have mercy and pitee." <br>
And with that thought, for pure ashamed, <mark1>she</mark1><br>
Gan in hir hed to pulle, and that as faste, <br>
Whil he and all the peple forby <mark4>paste.</mark4><br>
<br>
And gan to caste and rollen up and doun <br>
With-inne hir thought his excellent <mark1>prowesse,</mark1><br>
And his estat, and also his <mark4>renown,</mark4><br>
His wit, his shap, and eek his gentillesse; <br>
But moost hir favour was, for his distresse<br>
Was al for hire, and thoughte it was a <mark5>routhe</mark5><br>
To sleen swich oon, if that he mente trouthe. <br>
<br>
Now myghte som envious jangle <mark1>thus:</mark1><br>
"This was a sodeyn love; how myght it <mark1>be</mark1><br>
That she so lightly loved <mark1>Troilus</mark1><br>
Right for the firste syghte; ye, <mark4>pardee?"</mark4><br>
Now who-so seith so, mote he never <mark3>thee!</mark3><br>
For everything, a gynnyng hath it nede<br>
Er al be wrought, with-outen any <mark5>drede.</mark5><br>
<br>
For I sey nought that she so sodeynly <br>
Yaf hym hire love, but that she gan enclyne<br>
To like him first, and I have told yow whi; <br>
And after that, his manhod and his <mark4>pyne</mark4><br>
Made love with-inne hire herte for to <mark5>myne,</mark5><br>
For which, by proces and by good servyse, <br>
He gat hire love, and in no sodeyn <mark4>wyse.</mark4><br>
