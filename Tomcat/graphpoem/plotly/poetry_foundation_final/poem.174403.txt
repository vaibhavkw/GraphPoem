Title : Prometheus Unbound <br>
Author : Percy Bysshe Shelley <br><br>

(excerpt)  SCENE.--A Ravine of Icy Rocks in the Indian Caucasus. Prometheus is discovered bound to the Precipice. Panthea and Ione are seated at his feet. Time, night. During the Scene, morning slowly <mark4>breaks.</mark4><br>
<br>
Monarch of Gods and Daemons, and all <mark4>Spirits</mark4><br>
But One, who throng those bright and rolling <mark4>worlds</mark4><br>
Which Thou and I alone of living <mark4>things</mark4><br>
Behold with sleepless eyes! regard this Earth <br>
Made multitudinous with thy slaves, whom <mark3>thou</mark3><br>
Requitest for knee-worship, prayer, and <mark4>praise,</mark4><br>
And toil, and hecatombs of broken <mark4>hearts,</mark4><br>
With fear and self-contempt and barren <mark4>hope.</mark4><br>
Whilst me, who am thy foe, eyeless in <mark4>hate,</mark4><br>
Hast thou made reign and triumph, to thy <mark4>scorn,</mark4><br>
O'er mine own misery and thy vain <mark4>revenge.</mark4><br>
Three thousand years of sleep-unsheltered <mark4>hours,</mark4><br>
And moments aye divided by keen <mark4>pangs</mark4><br>
Till they seemed years, torture and <mark4>solitude,</mark4><br>
Scorn and despair,--these are mine <mark4>empire:--</mark4><br>
More glorious far than that which thou surveyest <br>
From thine unenvied throne, O Mighty <mark4>God!</mark4><br>
Almighty, had I deigned to share the <mark4>shame</mark4><br>
Of thine ill tyranny, and hung not <mark5>here</mark5><br>
Nailed to this wall of eagle-baffling <mark4>mountain,</mark4><br>
Black, wintry, dead, unmeasured; without <mark5>herb,</mark5><br>
Insect, or beast, or shape or sound of <mark4>life.</mark4><br>
Ah me! alas, pain, pain <mark1>ever</mark1>, for <mark4>ever!</mark4><br>
<br>
No change, no pause, no hope! Yet I <mark4>endure.</mark4><br>
I ask the Earth, have not the mountains <mark4>felt?</mark4><br>
I ask yon <mark4>Heaven</mark4>, the all-beholding <mark4>Sun,</mark4><br>
Has it not seen? The Sea, in storm or <mark4>calm,</mark4><br>
Heaven's ever-changing Shadow, spread below, <br>
Have its deaf waves not heard my <mark4>agony?</mark4><br>
Ah me! alas, pain, pain <mark1>ever</mark1>, for <mark1>ever!</mark1><br>
<br>
The crawling glaciers pierce me with the <mark4>spears</mark4><br>
Of their moon-freezing <mark4>crystals</mark4>, the bright <mark4>chains</mark4><br>
Eat with their burning cold into my <mark4>bones.</mark4><br>
Heaven's winged hound, polluting from thy <mark4>lips</mark4><br>
His beak in poison not his own, tears <mark4>up</mark4><br>
My heart; and shapeless sights come wandering by, <br>
The ghastly people of the realm of <mark4>dream,</mark4><br>
Mocking me: and the Earthquake-fiends are <mark4>charged</mark4><br>
To wrench the rivets from my quivering <mark4>wounds</mark4><br>
When the rocks split and close again <mark4>behind:</mark4><br>
While from their loud abysses howling throng <br>
The genii of the storm, urging the <mark4>rage</mark4><br>
Of whirlwind, and afflict me with keen <mark4>hail.</mark4><br>
And yet to me welcome is day and <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
Whether one breaks the hoar frost of the <mark4>morn,</mark4><br>
Or starry, dim, and slow, the other <mark4>climbs</mark4><br>
The leaden-coloured east; for then they <mark4>lead</mark4><br>
The wingless, crawling hours, one among <mark4>whom</mark4><br>
--As some dark Priest hales the reluctant <mark4>victim--</mark4><br>
Shall drag thee, cruel King, to kiss the <mark4>blood</mark4><br>
From these pale feet, which then might trample <mark3>thee</mark3><br>
If they disdained not such a prostrate slave. <br>
Disdain! Ah no! I pity thee. What <mark4>ruin</mark4><br>
Will hunt thee undefended through wide <mark4>Heaven!</mark4><br>
How will thy soul, cloven to its depth with <mark4>terror,</mark4><br>
Gape like a hell within! I speak in <mark4>grief,</mark4><br>
Not exultation, for I hate no <mark4>more,</mark4><br>
As then ere misery made me wise. The <mark4>curse</mark4><br>
Once breathed on thee I would recall. Ye <mark4>Mountains,</mark4><br>
Whose many-voiced Echoes, through the <mark4>mist</mark4><br>
Of cataracts, flung the thunder of that <mark4>spell!</mark4><br>
Ye icy Springs, stagnant with wrinkling <mark4>frost,</mark4><br>
Which vibrated to hear me, and then <mark4>crept</mark4><br>
Shuddering through India! Thou serenest <mark4>Air,</mark4><br>
Through which the Sun walks burning without <mark4>beams!</mark4><br>
And ye swift Whirlwinds, who on poised <mark4>wings</mark4><br>
Hung mute and moveless o'er yon hushed <mark4>abyss,</mark4><br>
As thunder, louder than your own, made <mark4>rock</mark4><br>
The orbed world! If then my words had <mark4>power,</mark4><br>
Though I am changed so that aught evil wish <br>
Is dead within; although no memory <mark3>be</mark3><br>
Of what is hate, let them not lose it <mark3>now!</mark3><br>
What was that curse? for ye all heard me <mark4>speak.</mark4><br>
