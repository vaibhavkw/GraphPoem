Title : The Heavy Bear Who Goes With Me <br>
Author : Delmore Schwartz <br><br>

"the withness of the <mark4>body"</mark4><br>
The heavy bear who goes with <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
A manifold honey to smear his <mark3>face,</mark3><br>
Clumsy and lumbering here and <mark4>there,</mark4><br>
The central ton of every <mark3>place,</mark3><br>
The hungry beating brutish <mark4>one</mark4><br>
In love with candy, anger, and <mark4>sleep,</mark4><br>
Crazy factotum, dishevelling <mark4>all,</mark4><br>
Climbs the building, kicks the <mark4>football,</mark4><br>
Boxes his brother in the hate-ridden <mark4>city.</mark4><br>
<br>
Breathing at my side, that heavy <mark4>animal,</mark4><br>
That heavy bear who sleeps with <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Howls in his sleep for a world of <mark4>sugar,</mark4><br>
A sweetness intimate as the water's <mark4>clasp,</mark4><br>
Howls in his sleep because the <mark4>tight-rope</mark4><br>
Trembles and shows the darkness beneath.   <br>
--The strutting show-off is <mark4>terrified,</mark4><br>
Dressed in his dress-suit, bulging his <mark4>pants,</mark4><br>
Trembles to think that his quivering meat   <br>
Must finally wince to nothing at <mark1>all.</mark1><br>
<br>
That inescapable animal walks with <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Has followed me since the black womb <mark4>held,</mark4><br>
Moves where I move, distorting my <mark4>gesture,</mark4><br>
A caricature, a swollen shadow, <br>
A stupid clown of the spirit's motive,   <br>
Perplexes and affronts with his own <mark4>darkness,</mark4><br>
The secret life of belly and <mark4>bone,</mark4><br>
Opaque, too near, my private, yet <mark3>unknown,</mark3><br>
Stretches to embrace the very <mark4>dear</mark4><br>
With whom I would walk without him <mark3>near,</mark3><br>
Touches her grossly, although a <mark4>word</mark4><br>
Would bare my heart and make me <mark3>clear,</mark3><br>
Stumbles, flounders, and strives to be <mark4>fed</mark4><br>
Dragging me with him in his mouthing <mark4>care,</mark4><br>
Amid the hundred million of his <mark4>kind,</mark4><br>
The scrimmage of appetite <mark4>everywhere.</mark4><br>
