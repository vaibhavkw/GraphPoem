Title : Nature <br>
Author : Henry Wadsworth Longfellow <br><br>

As a fond mother, when the day is o'er, <br>
Leads by the hand her little child to <mark3>bed,</mark3><br>
Half willing, half reluctant to be <mark3>led,</mark3><br>
And leave his broken playthings on the <mark3>floor,</mark3><br>
Still gazing at them through the open <mark3>door,</mark3><br>
Nor wholly reassured and <mark4>comforted</mark4><br>
By promises of others in their <mark4>stead,</mark4><br>
Which, though more splendid, may not please him <mark3>more;</mark3><br>
So Nature deals with us, and takes <mark3>away</mark3><br>
Our playthings one by one, and by the <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
Leads us to rest so gently, that we <mark3>go</mark3><br>
Scarce knowing if we wish to go or <mark3>stay,</mark3><br>
Being too full of sleep to <mark3>understand</mark3><br>
How far the unknown transcends the what we <mark3>know.</mark3><br>
