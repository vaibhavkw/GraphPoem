Title : Francine's Room <br>
Author : Louise Erdrich <br><br>

This is <mark4>Tarsus</mark4>, one place like anyplace <mark4>else.</mark4><br>
And this is my circuit, the rodeo, <mark3>fair.</mark3><br>
The farmboys blow through here in pickups, <mark4>wild</mark4><br>
as horses in their oat <mark4>sacks.</mark4><br>
The women wear <mark4>spurs.</mark4><br>
In the trailers the cattle are pounding for <mark3>air.</mark3><br>
<br>
My room is the same as last year. They always give <mark1>me</mark1><br>
end of the corridor, left, the top <mark4>floor.</mark4><br>
Privacy. Why not. I've been through here <mark3>before.</mark3><br>
I'm the town's <mark4>best</mark4><br>
customer. A minor <mark4>attraction.</mark4><br>
I buy from their stores. Remember this bureau-- <br>
<br>
battered wood, the fake drawer and split <mark4>mirror?</mark4><br>
And even the glass marks, ring within <mark4>ring</mark4><br>
of spilled drinks. When I sit <mark4>here</mark4><br>
the widest warped links have a <mark4>center.</mark4><br>
Strung out they're a year's worth of slack, a <mark4>tether</mark4><br>
that swings around the spine's dark <mark4>pole</mark4><br>
<br>
and swings back. Each time I <mark4>return</mark4><br>
something's <mark4>different,</mark4><br>
although there's a few I can always <mark4>expect.</mark4><br>
The cracks in the mirror: always more, never <mark4>less.</mark4><br>
The stains in the bedspread have <mark4>spread.</mark4><br>
And the rip in the window shade lets through more <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
strange light, since I come here to be in the dark.   <br>
Should be taped. A few things can be saved <mark5>anyhow.</mark5><br>
But I don't want to get into <mark4>that.</mark4><br>
<br>
I set up my pictures. Mother and <mark4>Father,</mark4><br>
stiffer, more blurred every <mark4>year.</mark4><br>
I turn them to the walls when there's customers, <mark1>that</mark1><br>
is the least I can do. What mending there <mark4>is</mark4><br>
occurs in small <mark4>acts,</mark4><br>
and after the fact of the damage,   <br>
when nothing is ever enough. <br>
There is always the scar to remind <mark1>me</mark1><br>
that things were once <mark4>perfect</mark4>, at <mark4>least</mark4><br>
<br>
they were new. I first came here when I was a <mark4>girl.</mark4><br>
It surprised me, the things that two people could <mark3>do</mark3><br>
left alone in a room. Not long and I <mark4>learned.</mark4><br>
I learned what the selves are a man can <mark4>disown</mark4><br>
till he lets them to life in a room. <br>
<br>
It's the region's hard winters, snowed in with the snow   <br>
half the year. I'd expect them to think up a <mark3>few.</mark3><br>
But nothing surprises me, not <mark4>anymore.</mark4><br>
The plumbing can only get worse with the <mark4>cold.</mark4><br>
It's true, even summers the water is <mark4>foul</mark4><br>
and flows slowly, a thin brown trickle by <mark4>noon.</mark4><br>
<br>
Heat pours in the west, freak waves of dry <mark4>lightning</mark4><br>
soak the whole town in a feverish <mark1>light.</mark1><br>
Beneath me, the tables of water have <mark4>dropped</mark4><br>
to unheard-of levels. It's been a long <mark4>drought.</mark4><br>
I bend my whole arm to the handle, the valve <br>
yawns open but nothing comes out. What else should I   <br>
expect. Wrung cloth. The body washing in <mark4>dust.</mark4><br>
