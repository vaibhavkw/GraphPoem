Title : The House of Life: 36. Life-in-Love <br>
Author : Dante Gabriel Rossetti <br><br>

Not in thy body is thy life at <mark3>all</mark3><br>
But in this lady's lips and hands and <mark3>eyes;</mark3><br>
         Through these she yields thee life that vivifies<br>
What else were sorrow's servant and death's <mark3>thrall.</mark3><br>
Look on thyself without her, and <mark3>recall</mark3><br>
The waste remembrance and forlorn <mark3>surmise</mark3><br>
That liv'd but in a dead-drawn breath of <mark3>sighs</mark3><br>
O'er vanish'd hours and hours <mark4>eventual.</mark4><br>
<br>
Even so much life hath the poor tress of <mark3>hair</mark3><br>
Which, stor'd apart, is all love hath to <mark3>show</mark3><br>
For heart-beats and for fire-heats long <mark3>ago;</mark3><br>
Even so much life endures unknown, even <mark3>where,</mark3><br>
         'Mid change the changeless night environeth,<br>
         Lies all that golden hair undimm'd in death.<br>
