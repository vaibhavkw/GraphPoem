Title : Ashes of Life <br>
Author : Edna St. Vincent Millay <br><br>

Love has gone and left me and the days are all <mark3>alike;</mark3><br>
Eat I must, and sleep I will, ? and would that night were <mark4>here!</mark4><br>
But ah! ? to lie awake and hear the slow hours <mark3>strike!</mark3><br>
Would that it were day again! ? with twilight <mark4>near!</mark4><br>
<br>
Love has gone and left me and I don't know what to <mark3>do;</mark3><br>
This or that or what you will is all the same to <mark3>me;</mark3><br>
But all the things that I begin I leave before I'm through, <mark3>?</mark3><br>
There's little use in anything as far as I can <mark3>see.</mark3><br>
<br>
Love has gone and left me, ? and the neighbors knock and <mark3>borrow,</mark3><br>
And life goes on forever like the gnawing of a mouse, <mark3>?</mark3><br>
And to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow and <mark3>to-morrow</mark3><br>
There's this little street and this little <mark3>house.</mark3><br>
