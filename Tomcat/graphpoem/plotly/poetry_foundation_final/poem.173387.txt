Title : A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning <br>
Author : John Donne <br><br>

As virtuous men pass mildly <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
And whisper to their souls to <mark3>go,</mark3><br>
Whilst some of their sad friends do <mark3>say</mark3><br>
The breath goes now, and some say, <mark3>No:</mark3><br>
<br>
So let us melt, and make no <mark3>noise,</mark3><br>
No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests <mark4>move;</mark4><br>
'Twere profanation of our <mark3>joys</mark3><br>
To tell the laity our <mark4>love.</mark4><br>
<br>
Moving of th' earth brings harms and <mark4>fears,</mark4><br>
Men reckon what it did, and <mark4>meant;</mark4><br>
But trepidation of the <mark3>spheres,</mark3><br>
Though greater far, is <mark4>innocent.</mark4><br>
<br>
Dull sublunary lovers' <mark1>love</mark1><br>
(Whose soul is sense) cannot <mark4>admit</mark4><br>
Absence, because it doth <mark4>remove</mark4><br>
Those things which elemented <mark3>it.</mark3><br>
<br>
But we by a love so much <mark3>refined,</mark3><br>
That our selves know not what it <mark4>is,</mark4><br>
Inter-assured of the <mark3>mind,</mark3><br>
Care less, eyes, <mark4>lips</mark4>, and hands to <mark4>miss.</mark4><br>
<br>
Our two souls therefore, which are <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
Though I must go, endure not <mark4>yet</mark4><br>
A breach, but an <mark4>expansion,</mark4><br>
Like gold to airy thinness <mark4>beat.</mark4><br>
<br>
If they be two, they are two <mark3>so</mark3><br>
As stiff twin compasses are <mark3>two;</mark3><br>
Thy soul, the fixed foot, makes no <mark3>show</mark3><br>
To move, but doth, if the other <mark3>do.</mark3><br>
<br>
And though it in the center <mark4>sit,</mark4><br>
Yet when the other far doth <mark3>roam,</mark3><br>
It leans and hearkens after <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
And grows erect, as that comes <mark3>home.</mark3><br>
<br>
Such wilt thou be to me, who <mark4>must,</mark4><br>
Like th' other foot, obliquely <mark4>run;</mark4><br>
Thy firmness makes my circle <mark3>just,</mark3><br>
And makes me end where I <mark3>begun.</mark3><br>
