Title : The Blackstone Rangers <br>
Author : Gwendolyn Brooks <br><br>

<br>
AS SEEN BY <mark4>DISCIPLINES</mark4><br>
<br>
There they <mark3>are.</mark3><br>
Thirty at the <mark3>corner.</mark3><br>
Black, raw, <mark4>ready.</mark4><br>
Sores in the <mark4>city</mark4><br>
that do not want to <mark4>heal.</mark4><br>
THE <mark4>LEADERS</mark4><br>
<br>
Jeff. Gene. Geronimo. And <mark4>Bop.</mark4><br>
<br>
They cancel, cure and <mark4>curry.</mark4><br>
Hardly the dupes of the downtown <mark3>thing</mark3><br>
<br>
the cold bonbon, <br>
the rhinestone thing. And <mark4>hardly</mark4><br>
in a <mark4>hurry.</mark4><br>
Hardly Belafonte, <mark3>King,</mark3><br>
Black Jesus, Stokely, Malcolm X or <mark4>Rap.</mark4><br>
Bungled <mark4>trophies.</mark4><br>
Their country is a Nation on no <mark3>map.</mark3><br>
Jeff, Gene, Geronimo and <mark1>Bop</mark1><br>
in the passionate <mark4>noon,</mark4><br>
in bewitching <mark4>night</mark4><br>
are the detailed <mark1>men</mark1>, the copious <mark4>men.</mark4><br>
<br>
They curry, <mark4>cure,</mark4><br>
they cancel, cancelled images whose <mark4>Concerts</mark4><br>
are not divine, vivacious; the different <mark4>tins</mark4><br>
are intense last entries; pagan <mark4>argument;</mark4><br>
translations of the <mark1>night.</mark1><br>
The Blackstone bitter <mark4>bureaus</mark4><br>
(bureaucracy is footloose) edit, <mark4>fuse</mark4><br>
unfashionable damnations and <mark4>descent;</mark4><br>
and exulting, monstrous hand on monstrous <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
<br>
construct, strangely, a monstrous pearl or <mark4>grace.</mark4><br>
GANG <mark4>GIRLS</mark4><br>
A <mark5>Rangerette</mark5><br>
Gang Girls are sweet <mark4>exotics.</mark4><br>
Mary <mark4>Ann</mark4><br>
<br>
uses the nutrients of her <mark4>orient,</mark4><br>
<br>
but sometimes sighs for Cities of blue and <mark4>jewel</mark4><br>
beyond her Ranger rim of Cottage <mark4>Grove.</mark4><br>
<br>
(Bowery Boys, Disciples, Whip-Birds <mark4>will</mark4><br>
<br>
dissolve no margins, stop no savory sanctities.) <br>
Mary <mark4>is</mark4><br>
a rose in a whiskey <mark4>glass.</mark4><br>
Februaries shudder and are gone. Aprils   <br>
fret frankly, lilac hurries <mark4>on.</mark4><br>
Summer is a hard irregular ridge. <br>
October looks away. <br>
And that's the <mark4>Year!</mark4><br>
<br>
Save for her <mark4>bugle-love.</mark4><br>
Save for the bleat of not-obese <mark4>devotion.</mark4><br>
<br>
Save for Somebody Terribly Dying, <mark4>under</mark4><br>
the philanthropy of robins. Save for her <mark4>Ranger</mark4><br>
an amount of rainbow in a string-drawn bag.   <br>
"Where did you get the diamond?" Do not <mark3>ask:</mark3><br>
but swallow, straight, the spirals of his <mark3>flask</mark3><br>
and assist him at your zipper; pet his <mark4>lips</mark4><br>
and help him clutch you. <br>
Love's another <mark4>departure.</mark4><br>
Will there be any <mark4>arrivals</mark4>, <mark4>confirmations?</mark4><br>
Will there be gleaning? <br>
<br>
Mary, the Shakedancer's <mark4>child</mark4><br>
from the rooming-flat, pants carefully, peers <mark4>at</mark4><br>
her laboring lover <mark4>....</mark4><br>
Mary! Mary <mark1>Ann!</mark1><br>
Settle for sandwiches! settle for stocking <mark4>caps!</mark4><br>
<br>
for sudden blood, aborted <mark4>carnival,</mark4><br>
the props and niceties of <mark4>non-loneliness--</mark4><br>
the rhymes of <mark4>Leaning.</mark4><br>
