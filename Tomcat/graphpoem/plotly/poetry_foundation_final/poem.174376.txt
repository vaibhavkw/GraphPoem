Title : Sonnet 146: Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth, <br>
Author : William Shakespeare <br><br>

Poor soul, the centre of my sinful <mark3>earth,</mark3><br>
[......] these rebel powers that thee <mark3>array,</mark3><br>
Why dost thou pine within and suffer <mark3>dearth,</mark3><br>
Painting thy outward walls so costly <mark3>gay?</mark3><br>
Why so large cost, having so short a <mark4>lease,</mark4><br>
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion <mark3>spend?</mark3><br>
Shall worms, inheritors of this <mark4>excess,</mark4><br>
Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's <mark3>end?</mark3><br>
Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's <mark4>loss</mark4><br>
And let that pine to aggravate thy <mark3>store;</mark3><br>
Buy terms divine in selling hours of <mark3>dross;</mark3><br>
Within be fed, without be rich no <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on <mark3>men,</mark3><br>
And, Death once dead, there's no more dying <mark3>then.</mark3><br>
