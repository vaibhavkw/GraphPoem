Title : Mary's Girlhood (for a Picture) <br>
Author : Dante Gabriel Rossetti <br><br>

This is that blessed Mary, <mark3>pre-elect</mark3><br>
God's Virgin. Gone is a great while, and <mark3>she</mark3><br>
         Dwelt young in Nazareth of Galilee.<br>
Unto God's will she brought devout <mark3>respect,</mark3><br>
Profound simplicity of <mark4>intellect,</mark4><br>
And supreme patience. From her mother's <mark3>knee</mark3><br>
         Faithful and hopeful; wise in charity;<br>
Strong in grave peace; in pity <mark3>circumspect.</mark3><br>
<br>
So held she through her girlhood; as it were<br>
         An angel-water'd lily, that near God<br>
Grows and is quiet. Till, one dawn at <mark4>home,</mark4><br>
She woke in her white bed, and had no fear<br>
         At all,?yet wept till sunshine, and felt aw'd:<br>
Because the fulness of the time was <mark4>come.</mark4><br>
