Title : Astrophil and Stella 84: Highway, since you my chief Parnassus be <br>
Author : Sir Philip Sidney <br><br>

Highway, since you my chief Parnassus <mark4>be,</mark4><br>
And that my Muse, to some ears not unsweet, <br>
Tempers her words to trampling horses' <mark3>feet</mark3><br>
More oft than to a chamber <mark4>melody.</mark4><br>
Now, blessed you bear onward blessed <mark3>me</mark3><br>
To her, where I my heart, <mark4>safe-left</mark4>, shall <mark3>meet:</mark3><br>
My Muse and I must you of duty <mark3>greet</mark3><br>
With thanks and wishes, wishing <mark4>thankfully.</mark4><br>
Be you still fair, honour'd by public <mark3>heed;</mark3><br>
By no encroachment wrong'd, nor time <mark4>forgot,</mark4><br>
Nor blam'd for <mark4>blood</mark4>, nor sham'd for sinful <mark3>deed;</mark3><br>
And that you know I envy you no <mark3>lot</mark3><br>
Of highest wish, I wish you so much bliss,i <br>
Hundreds of years you Stella's feet may kiss.<br>
