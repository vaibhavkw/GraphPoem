Title : Epistle to Augusta <br>
Author : Lord Byron (George Gordon) <br><br>

My sister! my sweet sister! if a <mark3>name</mark3><br>
Dearer and purer were, it should be <mark3>thine.</mark3><br>
Mountains and seas divide us, but I <mark3>claim</mark3><br>
No tears, but tenderness to answer <mark3>mine:</mark3><br>
Go where I will, to me thou art the <mark3>same</mark3><br>
A lov'd regret which I would not <mark3>resign.</mark3><br>
There yet are two things in my <mark5>destiny?</mark5><br>
A world to roam through, and a home with <mark3>thee.</mark3><br>
<br>
The first were nothing?had I still the <mark3>last,</mark3><br>
It were the haven of my <mark4>happiness;</mark4><br>
But other claims and other ties thou <mark3>hast,</mark3><br>
And mine is not the wish to make them <mark4>less.</mark4><br>
A strange doom is thy father's son's, and <mark3>past</mark3><br>
Recalling, as it lies beyond <mark3>redress;</mark3><br>
Revers'd for him our grandsire's fate of <mark3>yore?</mark3><br>
He had no rest at sea, nor I on <mark3>shore.</mark3><br>
<br>
If my inheritance of storms hath <mark4>been</mark4><br>
In other <mark4>elements</mark4>, and on the <mark4>rocks</mark4><br>
Of perils, overlook'd or <mark4>unforeseen,</mark4><br>
I have sustain'd my share of worldly <mark3>shocks,</mark3><br>
The fault was <mark4>mine</mark4>, nor do I seek to <mark3>screen</mark3><br>
My errors with defensive <mark4>paradox;</mark4><br>
      I have been cunning in mine overthrow,<br>
The careful pilot of my proper <mark3>woe.</mark3><br>
<br>
Mine were my faults, and mine be their <mark4>reward.</mark4><br>
My whole life was a contest, since the <mark3>day</mark3><br>
That gave me being, gave me that which <mark4>marr'd</mark4><br>
The gift?a fate, or will, that walk'd <mark3>astray;</mark3><br>
And I at times have found the struggle <mark4>hard,</mark4><br>
And thought of shaking off my bonds of <mark3>clay:</mark3><br>
But now I fain would for a time <mark3>survive,</mark3><br>
If but to see what next can well <mark3>arrive.</mark3><br>
<br>
Kingdoms and empires in my little <mark1>day</mark1><br>
I have outliv'd, and yet I am not <mark4>old;</mark4><br>
And when I look on this, the petty <mark3>spray</mark3><br>
Of my own years of trouble, which have <mark4>roll'd</mark4><br>
Like a wild bay of breakers, melts <mark3>away:</mark3><br>
Something?I know not what?does still <mark3>uphold</mark3><br>
A spirit of slight patience; not in <mark4>vain,</mark4><br>
Even for its own sake, do we purchase <mark3>pain.</mark3><br>
<br>
Perhaps the workings of defiance <mark3>stir</mark3><br>
Within me?or perhaps a cold <mark4>despair,</mark4><br>
Brought on when ills habitually <mark3>recur,</mark3><br>
Perhaps a kinder clime, or purer <mark3>air</mark3><br>
(For even to this may change of soul <mark3>refer,</mark3><br>
And with light armour we may learn to <mark3>bear),</mark3><br>
Have taught me a strange <mark4>quiet</mark4>, which was <mark4>not</mark4><br>
The chief companion of a calmer <mark3>lot.</mark3><br>
<br>
I feel almost at times as I have <mark4>felt</mark4><br>
In happy childhood; trees, and flowers, and <mark4>brooks,</mark4><br>
Which do remember me of where I <mark3>dwelt</mark3><br>
Ere my young mind was sacrific'd to <mark3>books,</mark3><br>
Come as of yore upon me, and can <mark3>melt</mark3><br>
My heart with recognition of their <mark3>looks;</mark3><br>
And even at moments I could think I <mark3>see</mark3><br>
Some living thing to love?but none like <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
<br>
Here are the Alpine landscapes which <mark4>create</mark4><br>
A fund for contemplation; to <mark4>admire</mark4><br>
Is a brief feeling of a trivial <mark3>date;</mark3><br>
But something worthier do such scenes <mark3>inspire:</mark3><br>
Here to be lonely is not <mark4>desolate,</mark4><br>
For much I view which I could most <mark5>desire,</mark5><br>
And, above all, a lake I can <mark3>behold</mark3><br>
Lovelier, not dearer, than our own of <mark1>old.</mark1><br>
<br>
Oh that thou wert but with me!?but I <mark3>grow</mark3><br>
The fool of my own wishes, and <mark4>forget</mark4><br>
The solitude which I have vaunted <mark3>so</mark3><br>
Has lost its praise in this but one <mark3>regret;</mark3><br>
There may be others which I less may <mark3>show;</mark3><br>
I am not of the plaintive mood, and <mark3>yet</mark3><br>
I feel an ebb in my <mark4>philosophy,</mark4><br>
And the tide rising in my alter'd <mark3>eye.</mark3><br>
<br>
I did remind thee of our own dear <mark3>Lake,</mark3><br>
By the old Hall which may be mine no <mark4>more.</mark4><br>
Leman's is fair; but think not I <mark3>forsake</mark3><br>
The sweet remembrance of a dearer <mark1>shore:</mark1><br>
Sad havoc Time must with my memory <mark3>make</mark3><br>
Ere that or thou can fade these eyes <mark3>before;</mark3><br>
Though, like all things which I have lov'd, they <mark4>are</mark4><br>
Resign'd for ever, or divided <mark3>far.</mark3><br>
<br>
The world is all before me; I but <mark4>ask</mark4><br>
Of Nature that with which she will <mark3>comply?</mark3><br>
It is but in her summer's sun to <mark3>bask,</mark3><br>
To mingle with the quiet of her <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
To see her gentle face without a <mark3>mask,</mark3><br>
And never gaze on it with <mark4>apathy.</mark4><br>
She was my early friend, and now shall <mark4>be</mark4><br>
My sister?till I look again on <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
<br>
I can reduce all feelings but this <mark4>one;</mark4><br>
And that I would not; for at length I <mark1>see</mark1><br>
Such scenes as those wherein my life <mark3>begun,</mark3><br>
The earliest?even the only paths for <mark3>me?</mark3><br>
Had I but sooner learnt the crowd to <mark3>shun,</mark3><br>
I had been better than I now can <mark1>be;</mark1><br>
The passions which have torn me would have <mark4>slept;</mark4><br>
I had not suffer'd, and thou hadst not <mark3>wept.</mark3><br>
<br>
With false Ambition what had I to <mark3>do?</mark3><br>
Little with Love, and least of all with <mark3>Fame;</mark3><br>
And yet they came unsought, and with me <mark3>grew,</mark3><br>
And made me all which they can make?a <mark1>name,</mark1><br>
Yet this was not the end I did <mark3>pursue;</mark3><br>
Surely I once beheld a nobler <mark3>aim.</mark3><br>
But all is over?I am one the <mark1>more</mark1><br>
To baffled millions which have gone <mark1>before.</mark1><br>
<br>
And for the future, this world's future <mark3>may</mark3><br>
From me demand but little of my <mark4>care;</mark4><br>
I have outliv'd myself by many a <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
Having surviv'd so many things that <mark3>were;</mark3><br>
My years have been no slumber, but the <mark3>prey</mark3><br>
Of ceaseless vigils; for I had the <mark3>share</mark3><br>
Of life which might have fill'd a <mark4>century,</mark4><br>
Before its fourth in time had pass'd me <mark3>by.</mark3><br>
<br>
And for the remnant which may be to <mark4>come</mark4><br>
I am content; and for the past I <mark3>feel</mark3><br>
Not thankless, for within the crowded <mark3>sum</mark3><br>
Of struggles, happiness at times would <mark3>steal,</mark3><br>
      And for the present, I would not benumb<br>
My feelings further. Nor shall I <mark3>conceal</mark3><br>
That with all this I still can look <mark4>around,</mark4><br>
And worship Nature with a thought <mark3>profound.</mark3><br>
<br>
For thee, my own sweet sister, in thy <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
I know myself secure, as thou in <mark1>mine;</mark1><br>
We were and are?I am, even as thou <mark3>art?</mark3><br>
Beings who ne'er each other can <mark1>resign;</mark1><br>
It is the same, together or <mark3>apart,</mark3><br>
From life's commencement to its slow <mark3>decline</mark3><br>
We are entwin'd?let death come slow or <mark4>fast,</mark4><br>
The tie which bound the first endures the <mark1>last!</mark1><br>
