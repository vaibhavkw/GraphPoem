Title : Tao in the Yankee Stadium Bleachers <br>
Author : John Updike <br><br>

Distance brings proportion. From here<br>
the populated <mark4>tiers</mark4><br>
as much as players seem part of the show:<br>
a constructed stage beast, three folds of Dante's <mark4>rose,</mark4><br>
or a Chinese military <mark4>hat</mark4><br>
cunningly chased with <mark4>bodies.</mark4><br>
"Falling from his <mark4>chariot</mark4>, a drunk man is <mark4>unhurt</mark4><br>
because his soul is intact. Not knowing his <mark4>fall,</mark4><br>
he is unastonished, he is <mark4>invulnerable."</mark4><br>
So, too, the "pure man"?"pure"<br>
in the sense of undisturbed water.<br>
<br>
"It is not necessary to seek <mark4>out</mark4><br>
a wasteland, swamp, or <mark4>thicket."</mark4><br>
The opposing pitcher's pertinent <mark4>hesitations,</mark4><br>
the sky, this meadow, Mantle's thick baked neck,<br>
the old men who in the changing rosters <mark3>see</mark3><br>
a personal mutability,<br>
green slats, wet stone are all to <mark3>me</mark3><br>
as when an emperor <mark4>commands</mark4><br>
a performance with a gesture of his <mark4>eyes.</mark4><br>
<br>
"No king on his throne has the joy of the dead,"<br>
the skull told Chuang-tzu.<br>
The thought of death is peppermint to you <br>
when games begin with patriotic <mark3>song</mark3><br>
and a democratic sun beats broadly down. <br>
The Inner Journey seems unjudgeably <mark3>long</mark3><br>
when small boys purchase cups of <mark4>ice</mark4><br>
and, distant as a <mark4>paradise,</mark4><br>
experts, passionate and <mark4>deft,</mark4><br>
hold motionless while Berra flies to <mark3>left.</mark3><br>
