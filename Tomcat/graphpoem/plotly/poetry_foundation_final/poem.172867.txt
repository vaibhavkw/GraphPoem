Title : Youth and Calm <br>
Author : Matthew Arnold <br><br>

<br>
'Tis death! and peace, indeed, is <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
And ease from shame, and rest from <mark4>fear.</mark4><br>
There's nothing can dismarble <mark3>now</mark3><br>
The smoothness of that limpid <mark3>brow.</mark3><br>
But is a calm like this, in <mark3>truth,</mark3><br>
The crowning end of life and <mark3>youth,</mark3><br>
And when this boon rewards the <mark3>dead,</mark3><br>
Are all debts <mark4>paid</mark4>, has all been <mark3>said?</mark3><br>
And is the heart of youth so <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
Its step so firm, its eye so <mark3>bright,</mark3><br>
Because on its hot brow there <mark3>blows</mark3><br>
A wind of promise and <mark3>repose</mark3><br>
From the far grave, to which it <mark3>goes;</mark3><br>
Because it hath the hope to <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
One day, to harbour in the <mark4>tomb?</mark4><br>
Ah no, the bliss youth dreams is <mark3>one</mark3><br>
For daylight, for the cheerful <mark3>sun,</mark3><br>
For feeling nerves and living <mark4>breath?</mark4><br>
Youth dreams a bliss on this side <mark3>death.</mark3><br>
It dreams a rest, if not more <mark3>deep,</mark3><br>
More grateful than this marble <mark3>sleep;</mark3><br>
It hears a voice within it <mark3>tell:</mark3><br>
Calm's not life's crown, though calm is <mark3>well.</mark3><br>
'Tis all perhaps which man <mark4>acquires,</mark4><br>
But 'tis not what our youth <mark3>desires.</mark3><br>
