Title : Sonnets from the Portuguese 14: If thou must love me, let it be for nought <br>
Author : Elizabeth Barrett Browning <br><br>

If thou must love me, let it be for nought <br>
Except for love's sake only. Do not <mark3>say</mark3><br>
I love her for her smile ... her look ... her <mark3>way</mark3><br>
Of speaking gently, ... for a trick of <mark3>thought</mark3><br>
That falls in well with mine, and certes <mark3>brought</mark3><br>
A sense of pleasant ease on such a <mark3>day'--</mark3><br>
For these things in themselves, Beloved, <mark3>may</mark3><br>
Be changed, or change for thee,--and love, so <mark3>wrought,</mark3><br>
May be unwrought so. Neither love me <mark3>for</mark3><br>
Thine own dear pity's wiping my cheeks <mark3>dry,--</mark3><br>
A creature might forget to weep, who <mark3>bore</mark3><br>
Thy comfort long, and lose thy love <mark3>thereby!</mark3><br>
But love me for love's sake, that <mark4>evermore</mark4><br>
Thou may'st love on, through love's eternity.<br>
