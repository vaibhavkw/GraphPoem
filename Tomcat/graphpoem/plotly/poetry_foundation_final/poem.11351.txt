Title : The Long Voyage<br>
Author : Malcolm Cowley<br><br>

Not that the pines were darker <mark1>there,</mark1><br>
nor mid-May dogwood brighter <mark1>there,</mark1><br>
nor swifts more swift in summer <mark3>air;</mark3><br>
it was my own <mark1>country,</mark1><br>
<br>
having its thunderclap of <mark4>spring,</mark4><br>
its long midsummer <mark4>ripening,</mark4><br>
its corn hoar-stiff at <mark4>harvesting,</mark4><br>
almost like any <mark1>country,</mark1><br>
<br>
yet being mine; its face, its <mark3>speech,</mark3><br>
its hills bent low within my <mark3>reach,</mark3><br>
its river birch and upland <mark3>beech</mark3><br>
were mine, of my own <mark1>country.</mark1><br>
<br>
Now the dark waters at the <mark3>bow</mark3><br>
fold back, like earth against the <mark3>plow;</mark3><br>
foam brightens like the dogwood <mark3>now</mark3><br>
at home, in my own <mark1>country.</mark1><br>
