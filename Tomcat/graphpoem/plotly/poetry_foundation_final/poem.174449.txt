Title : The Well of St. Keyne <br>
Author : Robert Southey <br><br>

<br>
A Well there is in the west <mark1>country,</mark1><br>
And a clearer one never was <mark4>seen;</mark4><br>
There is not a wife in the west <mark1>country</mark1><br>
But has heard of the Well of St. <mark1>Keyne.</mark1><br>
<br>
An oak and an elm-tree stand <mark4>beside,</mark4><br>
And behind doth an ash-tree <mark3>grow,</mark3><br>
And a willow from the bank above<br>
Droops to the water <mark3>below.</mark3><br>
<br>
A traveller came to the Well of St. <mark1>Keyne;</mark1><br>
Joyfully he drew <mark3>nigh,</mark3><br>
For from the cock-crow he had been travelling,<br>
And there was not a cloud in the <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
<br>
He drank of the water so cool and <mark4>clear,</mark4><br>
For thirsty and hot was <mark3>he,</mark3><br>
And he sat down upon the <mark4>bank</mark4><br>
Under the <mark3>willow-tree.</mark3><br>
<br>
There came a man from the house hard <mark3>by</mark3><br>
At the Well to fill his <mark3>pail;</mark3><br>
On the Well-side he rested <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
And he bade the Stranger <mark3>hail.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Now art thou a bachelor, Stranger?" quoth <mark1>he,</mark1><br>
"For an if thou hast a <mark3>wife,</mark3><br>
The happiest draught thou hast drank this day<br>
That ever thou didst in thy <mark3>life.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Or has thy good woman, if one thou <mark4>hast,</mark4><br>
Ever here in Cornwall <mark4>been?</mark4><br>
For an if she have, I'll venture my <mark1>life</mark1><br>
She has drank of the Well of St. <mark1>Keyne."</mark1><br>
<br>
"I have left a good woman who never was <mark4>here."</mark4><br>
The Stranger he made <mark3>reply,</mark3><br>
"But that my draught should be the better for <mark4>that,</mark4><br>
I pray you answer me <mark3>why?"</mark3><br>
<br>
"St. Keyne," quoth the Cornish-man, "many a time<br>
Drank of this crystal <mark4>Well,</mark4><br>
And before the Angel summon'd <mark5>her,</mark5><br>
She laid on the water a <mark3>spell.</mark3><br>
<br>
"If the Husband of this gifted <mark1>Well</mark1><br>
Shall drink before his <mark1>Wife,</mark1><br>
A happy man thenceforth is <mark1>he,</mark1><br>
For he shall be Master for <mark1>life.</mark1><br>
<br>
"But if the Wife should drink of it <mark4>first,--</mark4><br>
God help the Husband <mark4>then!"</mark4><br>
The Stranger stoopt to the Well of St. <mark1>Keyne,</mark1><br>
And drank of the water <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
<br>
"You drank of the Well I warrant betimes?"<br>
He to the Cornish-man <mark4>said:</mark4><br>
But the Cornish-man smiled as the Stranger <mark4>spake,</mark4><br>
And sheepishly shook his <mark3>head.</mark3><br>
<br>
"I hasten'd as soon as the wedding was <mark4>done,</mark4><br>
And left my Wife in the <mark4>porch;</mark4><br>
But i' faith she had been wiser than <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
For she took a bottle to <mark4>Church."</mark4><br>
