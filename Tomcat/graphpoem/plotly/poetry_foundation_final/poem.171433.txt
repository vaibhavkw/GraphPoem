Title : In the Tree House at Night <br>
Author : James L. Dickey <br><br>

And now the green household is dark.   <br>
The half-moon completely is <mark4>shining</mark4><br>
On the earth-lighted tops of the <mark4>trees.</mark4><br>
To be dead, a house must be <mark4>still.</mark4><br>
The floor and the walls wave me <mark4>slowly;</mark4><br>
I am deep in them over my <mark3>head.</mark3><br>
The needles and pine cones about <mark1>me</mark1><br>
<br>
Are full of small birds at their roundest,   <br>
Their fists without mercy <mark4>gripping</mark4><br>
Hard down through the tree to the <mark4>roots</mark4><br>
To sing back at light when they feel <mark3>it.</mark3><br>
We lie here like angels in <mark4>bodies,</mark4><br>
My brothers and I, one <mark3>dead,</mark3><br>
The other asleep from much <mark4>living,</mark4><br>
<br>
In mid-air huddled beside <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
Dark climbed to us here as we <mark4>climbed</mark4><br>
Up the nails I have hammered all day <br>
Through the sprained, comic rungs of the <mark4>ladder</mark4><br>
Of broom handles, crate slats, and laths <br>
Foot by foot up the trunk to the <mark4>branches</mark4><br>
Where we came out at last over <mark4>lakes</mark4><br>
<br>
Of leaves, of fields disencumbered of <mark1>earth</mark1><br>
That move with the moves of the <mark3>spirit.</mark3><br>
Each nail that sustains us I set <mark1>here;</mark1><br>
Each nail in the house is now <mark4>steadied</mark4><br>
By my dead brother's huge, freckled <mark4>hand.</mark4><br>
Through the years, he has pointed his <mark4>hammer</mark4><br>
Up into these limbs, and told <mark4>us</mark4><br>
<br>
That we must ascend, and all lie <mark1>here.</mark1><br>
Step after step he has brought <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Embracing the trunk as his <mark4>body,</mark4><br>
Shaking its limbs with my <mark4>heartbeat,</mark4><br>
Till the pine cones danced without <mark4>wind</mark4><br>
And fell from the branches like <mark4>apples.</mark4><br>
In the arm-slender forks of our <mark4>dwelling</mark4><br>
<br>
I breathe my live brother's light <mark4>hair.</mark4><br>
The blanket around us <mark4>becomes</mark4><br>
As solid as stone, and it <mark4>sways.</mark4><br>
With all my heart, I <mark4>close</mark4><br>
The blue, timeless eye of my <mark3>mind.</mark3><br>
Wind <mark4>springs</mark4>, as my dead brother <mark4>smiles</mark4><br>
And touches the tree at the <mark4>root;</mark4><br>
<br>
A shudder of joy runs up <br>
The trunk; the needles <mark4>tingle;</mark4><br>
One bird uncontrollably <mark4>cries.</mark4><br>
The wind changes round, and I <mark5>stir</mark5><br>
Within another's <mark1>life</mark1>, Whose <mark1>life?</mark1><br>
Who is dead? Whose presence is <mark1>living?</mark1><br>
When may I fall strangely to <mark1>earth,</mark1><br>
<br>
Who am nailed to this branch by a <mark1>spirit?</mark1><br>
Can two bodies make up a <mark4>third?</mark4><br>
To sing, must I feel the world's <mark4>light?</mark4><br>
My green, graceful bones fill the <mark3>air</mark3><br>
With sleeping birds. <mark1>Alone</mark1>, <mark1>alone</mark1><br>
And with them I move <mark4>gently.</mark4><br>
I move at the heart of the <mark4>world.</mark4><br>
