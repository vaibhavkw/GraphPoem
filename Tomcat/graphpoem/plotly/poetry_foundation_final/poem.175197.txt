Title : Widow McFarlane <br>
Author : Edgar Lee Masters <br><br>

I was the Widow McFarlane, <br>
Weaver of carpets for all the village. <br>
And I pity you still at the loom of life, <br>
You who are singing to the <mark4>shuttle</mark4><br>
And lovingly watching the work of your hands, <br>
If you reach the day of hate, of terrible <mark4>truth.</mark4><br>
For the cloth of life is woven, you know, <br>
To a pattern hidden under the loom i <br>
A pattern you never <mark1>see!</mark1><br>
And you weave high-hearted, <mark1>singing</mark1>, <mark1>singing,</mark1><br>
You guard the threads of love and friendship <br>
For noble figures in gold and <mark4>purple.</mark4><br>
And long after other eyes can <mark1>see</mark1><br>
You have woven a moon-white strip of <mark4>cloth,</mark4><br>
You laugh in your strength, for Hope o'erlays <mark4>it</mark4><br>
With shapes of love and beauty. <br>
The loom stops short! The pattern's <mark4>out!</mark4><br>
You're alone in the room! You have woven a shroud! <br>
And hate of it lays you in <mark1>it!</mark1><br>
