Title : Tract <br>
Author : William Carlos Williams <br><br>

I will teach you          my <mark4>townspeople</mark4><br>
how to perform          a funeral <mark4>--</mark4><br>
for you have it          over a troop <br>
of <mark4>artists--</mark4><br>
unless one should          scour the world <mark4>--</mark4><br>
you have the ground sense          <mark4>necessary.</mark4><br>
<br>
See! the hearse <mark4>leads.</mark4><br>
I begin with          a design for a <mark4>hearse.</mark4><br>
For Christ's sake          not black -- <br>
nor white either --          and not <mark4>polished!</mark4><br>
Let it be weathered --          like a farm wagon <mark4>--</mark4><br>
with gilt wheels          (this could <mark4>be</mark4><br>
applied fresh          at small <mark4>expense)</mark4><br>
or no wheels at <mark4>all:</mark4><br>
a rough dray to          drag over the <mark4>ground.</mark4><br>
<br>
Knock the glass <mark4>out!</mark4><br>
My God-glass,          my <mark1>townspeople!</mark1><br>
For what purpose?          Is it for the <mark4>dead</mark4><br>
to look out or          for us to <mark3>see</mark3><br>
how well he is housed          or to <mark1>see</mark1><br>
the flowers or          the lack of them <mark4>--</mark4><br>
or <mark4>what?</mark4><br>
To keep the rain          and snow from <mark4>him?</mark4><br>
He will have a          heavier rain <mark4>soon:</mark4><br>
pebbles and dirt          and what <mark4>not.</mark4><br>
Let there be no glass <mark4>--</mark4><br>
and no upholstery          <mark3>phew!</mark3><br>
and no little          brass <mark4>rollers</mark4><br>
and small easy wheels          on the bottom <mark4>--</mark4><br>
my townspeople          what are you thinking of? <br>
<br>
A rough          plain hearse <mark4>then</mark4><br>
with gilt wheels          and no top at <mark1>all.</mark1><br>
On this          the coffin <mark4>lies</mark4><br>
by its own <mark4>weight.</mark4><br>
<br>
No wreathes please <mark4>--</mark4><br>
especially no          hot house <mark4>flowers.</mark4><br>
Some common memento          is <mark4>better,</mark4><br>
something he prized          and is known by: <br>
his old clothes --          a few books perhaps <mark4>--</mark4><br>
God knows what!          You <mark4>realize</mark4><br>
how we are          about these <mark4>things</mark4><br>
my townspeople <mark1>--</mark1><br>
something will be found --          anything <br>
even flowers          if he had come to <mark4>that.</mark4><br>
So much for          the <mark1>hearse.</mark1><br>
<br>
For heaven's sake though          see to the <mark4>driver!</mark4><br>
Take off          the silk hat! In <mark4>fact</mark4><br>
that's no place          at all for him <mark1>--</mark1><br>
up there          <mark4>unceremoniously</mark4><br>
dragging our friend out          to his own <mark4>dignity!</mark4><br>
Bring him down --          bring him <mark4>down!</mark4><br>
Low and inconspicuous!          I'd not have him <mark4>ride</mark4><br>
on the wagon at all --          damn him <mark1>--</mark1><br>
the undertaker's          understrapper! <br>
Let him hold          the <mark4>reins</mark4><br>
and walk          at the <mark3>side</mark3><br>
and inconspicuously          <mark3>too!</mark3><br>
<br>
Then briefly          as to <mark4>yourselves:</mark4><br>
Walk behind --          as they do in <mark4>France,</mark4><br>
seventh class, or          if you <mark1>ride</mark1><br>
Hell take curtains!          Go with some show <br>
of inconvenience;          sit openly <mark4>--</mark4><br>
to the weather          as to grief. <br>
Or do you think          you can shut grief <mark4>in?</mark4><br>
What -- from us?          We who have <mark1>perhaps</mark1><br>
nothing to lose?          Share with <mark4>us</mark4><br>
share with us --          it will be <mark4>money</mark4><br>
in your <mark4>pockets.</mark4><br>
                              Go now <br>
I think you are          <mark4>ready.</mark4><br>
