Title : Dolores (Notre-Dame des Sept Douleurs) <br>
Author : Algernon Charles Swinburne <br><br>

Cold eyelids that hide like a <mark3>jewel</mark3><br>
Hard eyes that grow soft for an <mark3>hour;</mark3><br>
The heavy white limbs, and the <mark3>cruel</mark3><br>
Red mouth like a venomous <mark3>flower;</mark3><br>
When these are gone by with their <mark4>glories,</mark4><br>
What shall rest of thee <mark4>then</mark4>, what <mark4>remain,</mark4><br>
O mystic and sombre <mark1>Dolores,</mark1><br>
Our Lady of <mark3>Pain?</mark3><br>
<br>
Seven sorrows the priests give their <mark4>Virgin;</mark4><br>
But thy sins, which are seventy times <mark4>seven,</mark4><br>
Seven ages would fail thee to purge <mark4>in,</mark4><br>
And then they would haunt thee in <mark4>heaven:</mark4><br>
Fierce midnights and famishing <mark5>morrows,</mark5><br>
And the loves that complete and <mark4>control</mark4><br>
All the joys of the flesh, all the <mark4>sorrows</mark4><br>
That wear out the <mark3>soul.</mark3><br>
<br>
O garment not golden but <mark4>gilded,</mark4><br>
O garden where all men may <mark4>dwell,</mark4><br>
O tower not of ivory, but <mark5>builded</mark5><br>
By hands that reach heaven from <mark3>hell;</mark3><br>
O mystical rose of the <mark4>mire,</mark4><br>
O house not of gold but of <mark4>gain,</mark4><br>
O house of unquenchable <mark3>fire,</mark3><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain!</mark1><br>
<br>
O lips full of lust and of <mark4>laughter,</mark4><br>
Curled snakes that are fed from my <mark3>breast,</mark3><br>
Bite hard, lest remembrance come <mark3>after</mark3><br>
And press with new lips where you <mark3>pressed.</mark3><br>
For my heart too springs up at the <mark4>pressure,</mark4><br>
Mine eyelids too moisten and <mark4>burn;</mark4><br>
Ah, feed me and fill me with <mark4>pleasure,</mark4><br>
Ere pain come in <mark3>turn.</mark3><br>
<br>
In yesterday's reach and <mark4>to-morrow's,</mark4><br>
Out of sight though they lie of <mark5>to-day,</mark5><br>
There have been and there yet shall be <mark1>sorrows</mark1><br>
That smite not and bite not in <mark3>play.</mark3><br>
The life and the love thou <mark5>despisest,</mark5><br>
These hurt us indeed, and in <mark4>vain,</mark4><br>
O wise among women, and <mark4>wisest,</mark4><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
Who gave thee thy wisdom? what <mark4>stories</mark4><br>
      That stung thee, what visions that smote? <br>
Wert thou pure and a maiden, <mark1>Dolores,</mark1><br>
When desire took thee first by the <mark4>throat?</mark4><br>
What bud was the shell of a <mark4>blossom</mark4><br>
That all men may smell to and <mark3>pluck?</mark3><br>
What milk fed thee first at what <mark4>bosom?</mark4><br>
What sins gave thee <mark3>suck?</mark3><br>
<br>
We shift and bedeck and bedrape <mark4>us,</mark4><br>
Thou art noble and nude and <mark4>antique;</mark4><br>
Libitina thy mother, <mark1>Priapus</mark1><br>
Thy father, a Tuscan and <mark3>Greek.</mark3><br>
We play with light loves in the <mark4>portal,</mark4><br>
And wince and relent and <mark3>refrain;</mark3><br>
Loves die, and we know thee <mark3>immortal,</mark3><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
Fruits fail and love dies and time <mark4>ranges;</mark4><br>
Thou art fed with perpetual <mark5>breath,</mark5><br>
And alive after infinite <mark3>changes,</mark3><br>
And fresh from the kisses of <mark3>death;</mark3><br>
Of languors rekindled and <mark4>rallied,</mark4><br>
Of barren delights and <mark4>unclean,</mark4><br>
Things monstrous and fruitless, a <mark4>pallid</mark4><br>
And poisonous <mark3>queen.</mark3><br>
<br>
Could you hurt me, sweet lips, though I hurt <mark1>you?</mark1><br>
Men touch them, and change in a <mark4>trice</mark4><br>
The lilies and languors of <mark1>virtue</mark1><br>
For the raptures and roses of <mark3>vice;</mark3><br>
Those lie where thy foot on the floor <mark3>is,</mark3><br>
These crown and caress thee and <mark4>chain,</mark4><br>
O splendid and sterile <mark1>Dolores,</mark1><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
There are sins it may be to <mark4>discover,</mark4><br>
There are deeds it may be to <mark4>delight.</mark4><br>
What new work wilt thou find for thy <mark3>lover,</mark3><br>
What new passions for daytime or <mark3>night?</mark3><br>
What spells that they know not a word <mark1>of</mark1><br>
Whose lives are as leaves <mark4>overblown?</mark4><br>
What tortures undreamt <mark1>of</mark1>, unheard <mark1>of,</mark1><br>
<mark4>Unwritten</mark4>, <mark3>unknown?</mark3><br>
<br>
Ah beautiful passionate <mark4>body</mark4><br>
That never has ached with a <mark4>heart!</mark4><br>
On thy mouth though the kisses are <mark4>bloody,</mark4><br>
Though they sting till it shudder and <mark3>smart,</mark3><br>
More kind than the love we adore <mark1>is,</mark1><br>
They hurt not the heart or the <mark4>brain,</mark4><br>
O bitter and tender <mark1>Dolores,</mark1><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
As our kisses relax and <mark4>redouble,</mark4><br>
From the lips and the foam and the <mark4>fangs</mark4><br>
Shall no new sin be born for men's <mark3>trouble,</mark3><br>
No dream of impossible <mark3>pangs?</mark3><br>
With the sweet of the sins of old <mark4>ages</mark4><br>
Wilt thou satiate thy soul as of <mark4>yore?</mark4><br>
Too sweet is the rind, say the <mark3>sages,</mark3><br>
Too bitter the <mark3>core.</mark3><br>
<br>
Hast thou told all thy secrets the last <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
And bared all thy beauties to <mark4>one?</mark4><br>
Ah, where shall we go then for <mark4>pastime,</mark4><br>
If the worst that can be has been <mark3>done?</mark3><br>
But sweet as the rind was the core <mark1>is;</mark1><br>
We are fain of thee still, we are <mark4>fain,</mark4><br>
O sanguine and subtle <mark1>Dolores,</mark1><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
By the hunger of change and <mark4>emotion,</mark4><br>
By the thirst of unbearable <mark4>things,</mark4><br>
By despair, the twin-born of <mark3>devotion,</mark3><br>
By the pleasure that winces and <mark3>stings,</mark3><br>
The delight that consumes the <mark4>desire,</mark4><br>
The desire that outruns the <mark1>delight,</mark1><br>
By the cruelty deaf as a <mark1>fire</mark1><br>
And blind as the <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
<br>
By the ravenous teeth that have <mark4>smitten</mark4><br>
Through the kisses that blossom and <mark4>bud,</mark4><br>
By the lips intertwisted and <mark3>bitten</mark3><br>
Till the foam has a savour of <mark3>blood,</mark3><br>
By the pulse as it rises and <mark4>falters,</mark4><br>
By the hands as they slacken and <mark4>strain,</mark4><br>
I adjure thee, respond from thine <mark3>altars,</mark3><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
Wilt thou smile as a woman <mark5>disdaining</mark5><br>
The light fire in the veins of a <mark3>boy?</mark3><br>
But he comes to thee sad, without <mark3>feigning,</mark3><br>
Who has wearied of sorrow and <mark3>joy;</mark3><br>
Less careful of labour and <mark4>glory</mark4><br>
Than the elders whose hair has <mark5>uncurled:</mark5><br>
And young, but with fancies as <mark3>hoary</mark3><br>
And grey as the <mark4>world.</mark4><br>
<br>
I have passed from the outermost <mark1>portal</mark1><br>
To the shrine where a sin is a <mark4>prayer;</mark4><br>
What care though the service be <mark3>mortal?</mark3><br>
O our Lady of Torture, what <mark3>care?</mark3><br>
All thine the last wine that I pour <mark1>is,</mark1><br>
The last in the chalice we <mark3>drain,</mark3><br>
O fierce and luxurious <mark1>Dolores,</mark1><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
All thine the new wine of <mark1>desire,</mark1><br>
The fruit of four lips as they <mark4>clung</mark4><br>
Till the hair and the eyelids took <mark1>fire,</mark1><br>
The foam of a serpentine <mark3>tongue,</mark3><br>
The froth of the serpents of <mark1>pleasure,</mark1><br>
More salt than the foam of the <mark3>sea,</mark3><br>
Now felt as a flame, now at <mark3>leisure</mark3><br>
As wine shed for <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
<br>
Ah thy people, thy <mark4>children</mark4>, thy <mark4>chosen,</mark4><br>
Marked cross from the womb and <mark4>perverse!</mark4><br>
They have found out the secret to cozen <br>
The gods that constrain us and <mark3>curse;</mark3><br>
They alone, they are wise, and none <mark4>other;</mark4><br>
Give me place, even me, in their <mark4>train,</mark4><br>
O my sister, my spouse, and my <mark3>mother,</mark3><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
For the crown of our life as it <mark3>closes</mark3><br>
Is darkness, the fruit thereof <mark4>dust;</mark4><br>
No thorns go as deep as a <mark3>rose's,</mark3><br>
And love is more cruel than <mark3>lust.</mark3><br>
Time turns the old days to <mark4>derision,</mark4><br>
Our loves into corpses or <mark4>wives;</mark4><br>
And marriage and death and <mark3>division</mark3><br>
Make barren our <mark3>lives.</mark3><br>
<br>
And pale from the past we draw nigh <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
And satiate with comfortless <mark4>hours;</mark4><br>
And we know <mark1>thee</mark1>, how all men belie <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
And we gather the fruit of thy <mark3>flowers;</mark3><br>
The passion that slays and <mark4>recovers,</mark4><br>
The pangs and the kisses that <mark4>rain</mark4><br>
On the lips and the limbs of thy <mark3>lovers,</mark3><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
The desire of thy furious <mark4>embraces</mark4><br>
Is more than the wisdom of <mark4>years,</mark4><br>
On the blossom though blood lie in <mark4>traces,</mark4><br>
Though the foliage be sodden with <mark4>tears.</mark4><br>
For the lords in whose keeping the door <mark1>is</mark1><br>
That opens on all who draw <mark1>breath</mark1><br>
Gave the cypress to love, my <mark1>Dolores,</mark1><br>
The myrtle to <mark1>death.</mark1><br>
<br>
And they laughed, changing hands in the <mark4>measure,</mark4><br>
And they mixed and made peace after <mark5>strife;</mark5><br>
Pain melted in tears, and was <mark1>pleasure;</mark1><br>
Death tingled with blood, and was <mark3>life.</mark3><br>
Like lovers they melted and tingled, <br>
In the dusk of thine innermost <mark3>fane;</mark3><br>
In the darkness they murmured and <mark4>mingled,</mark4><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
In a twilight where virtues are <mark3>vices,</mark3><br>
In thy chapels, unknown of the <mark4>sun,</mark4><br>
To a tune that enthralls and entices, <br>
They were wed, and the twain were as <mark1>one.</mark1><br>
For the tune from thine altar hath <mark4>sounded</mark4><br>
Since God bade the world's work <mark4>begin,</mark4><br>
And the fume of thine incense <mark3>abounded,</mark3><br>
To sweeten the <mark3>sin.</mark3><br>
<br>
Love <mark4>listens</mark4>, and paler than <mark4>ashes,</mark4><br>
Through his curls as the crown on them <mark4>slips,</mark4><br>
Lifts languid wet eyelids and <mark3>lashes,</mark3><br>
And laughs with insatiable <mark3>lips.</mark3><br>
Thou shalt hush him with heavy <mark4>caresses,</mark4><br>
With music that scares the <mark4>profane;</mark4><br>
Thou shalt darken his eyes with thy <mark3>tresses,</mark3><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
Thou shalt blind his bright eyes though he <mark4>wrestle,</mark4><br>
Thou shalt chain his light limbs though he <mark4>strive;</mark4><br>
In his lips all thy serpents shall <mark3>nestle,</mark3><br>
In his hands all thy cruelties <mark3>thrive.</mark3><br>
In the daytime thy voice shall go through <mark4>him,</mark4><br>
In his dreams he shall feel thee and <mark4>ache;</mark4><br>
Thou shalt kindle by night and subdue <mark1>him</mark1><br>
Asleep and <mark3>awake.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thou shalt touch and make redder his <mark4>roses</mark4><br>
With juice not of fruit nor of <mark1>bud;</mark1><br>
When the sense in the spirit <mark5>reposes,</mark5><br>
Thou shalt quicken the soul through the <mark1>blood.</mark1><br>
Thine, thine the one grace we implore <mark1>is,</mark1><br>
Who would live and not languish or <mark3>feign,</mark3><br>
O sleepless and deadly <mark1>Dolores,</mark1><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
Dost thou dream, in a respite of <mark4>slumber,</mark4><br>
In a lull of the fires of thy <mark1>life,</mark1><br>
Of the days without name, without <mark3>number,</mark3><br>
When thy will stung the world into <mark1>strife;</mark1><br>
When, a goddess, the pulse of thy <mark4>passion</mark4><br>
Smote kings as they revelled in <mark4>Rome;</mark4><br>
And they hailed thee re-risen, O Thalassian, <br>
Foam-white, from the <mark3>foam?</mark3><br>
<br>
When thy lips had such lovers to <mark4>flatter;</mark4><br>
When the city lay red from thy <mark4>rods,</mark4><br>
And thine hands were as arrows to <mark3>scatter</mark3><br>
The children of change and their <mark3>gods;</mark3><br>
When the blood of thy foemen made <mark4>fervent</mark4><br>
A sand never moist from the <mark4>main,</mark4><br>
As one smote them, their lord and thy <mark3>servant,</mark3><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
On sands by the storm never <mark4>shaken,</mark4><br>
Nor wet from the washing of <mark4>tides;</mark4><br>
Nor by foam of the waves <mark4>overtaken,</mark4><br>
      Nor winds that the thunder bestrides; <br>
But red from the print of thy <mark4>paces,</mark4><br>
Made smooth for the world and its <mark4>lords,</mark4><br>
Ringed round with a flame of fair <mark4>faces,</mark4><br>
And splendid with <mark4>swords.</mark4><br>
<br>
There the <mark4>gladiator</mark4>, pale for thy <mark1>pleasure,</mark1><br>
Drew bitter and perilous <mark1>breath;</mark1><br>
There torments laid hold on the <mark3>treasure</mark3><br>
Of limbs too delicious for <mark1>death;</mark1><br>
When thy gardens were lit with live <mark4>torches;</mark4><br>
When the world was a steed for thy <mark4>rein;</mark4><br>
When the nations lay prone in thy <mark3>porches,</mark3><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
When, with flame all around him <mark4>aspirant,</mark4><br>
Stood flushed, as a harp-player <mark4>stands,</mark4><br>
The implacable beautiful <mark3>tyrant,</mark3><br>
Rose-crowned, having death in his <mark3>hands;</mark3><br>
And a sound as the sound of loud <mark4>water</mark4><br>
Smote far through the flight of the <mark4>fires,</mark4><br>
And mixed with the lightning of <mark3>slaughter</mark3><br>
      A thunder of lyres. <br>
<br>
Dost thou dream of what was and no more <mark1>is,</mark1><br>
The old kingdoms of earth and the <mark4>kings?</mark4><br>
Dost thou hunger for these things, <mark1>Dolores,</mark1><br>
For <mark4>these</mark4>, in a world of new <mark1>things?</mark1><br>
But thy bosom no fasts could <mark4>emaciate,</mark4><br>
No hunger compel to <mark3>complain</mark3><br>
Those lips that no bloodshed could satiate, <br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
As of old when the world's heart was <mark4>lighter,</mark4><br>
Through thy garments the grace of thee <mark4>glows,</mark4><br>
The white wealth of thy body made <mark3>whiter</mark3><br>
By the blushes of amorous <mark3>blows,</mark3><br>
And seamed with sharp lips and fierce <mark4>fingers,</mark4><br>
And branded by kisses that <mark4>bruise;</mark4><br>
When all shall be gone that now <mark4>lingers,</mark4><br>
Ah, what shall we <mark4>lose?</mark4><br>
<br>
Thou wert fair in the fearless old <mark4>fashion,</mark4><br>
And thy limbs are as melodies <mark4>yet,</mark4><br>
And move to the music of <mark1>passion</mark1><br>
With lithe and lascivious <mark3>regret.</mark3><br>
What ailed us, O gods, to desert <mark1>you</mark1><br>
For creeds that refuse and <mark4>restrain?</mark4><br>
Come down and redeem us from <mark1>virtue,</mark1><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
All shrines that were Vestal are <mark5>flameless,</mark5><br>
But the flame has not fallen from <mark4>this;</mark4><br>
Though obscure be the god, and though <mark4>nameless</mark4><br>
The eyes and the hair that we <mark4>kiss;</mark4><br>
Low fires that love sits by and <mark4>forges</mark4><br>
Fresh heads for his arrows and <mark4>thine;</mark4><br>
Hair loosened and soiled in mid <mark4>orgies</mark4><br>
With kisses and <mark3>wine.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thy skin changes country and <mark4>colour,</mark4><br>
And shrivels or swells to a <mark4>snake's.</mark4><br>
Let it brighten and bloat and grow <mark3>duller,</mark3><br>
We know it, the flames and the <mark3>flakes,</mark3><br>
Red brands on it smitten and <mark1>bitten,</mark1><br>
Round skies where a star is a <mark4>stain,</mark4><br>
And the leaves with thy litanies <mark4>written,</mark4><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
On thy bosom though many a kiss <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
There are none such as knew it of <mark4>old.</mark4><br>
Was it Alciphron once or Arisbe, <br>
Male ringlets or feminine <mark3>gold,</mark3><br>
That thy lips met with under the <mark5>statue,</mark5><br>
Whence a look shot out sharp after <mark4>thieves</mark4><br>
From the eyes of the garden-god at <mark1>you</mark1><br>
Across the <mark3>fig-leaves?</mark3><br>
<br>
Then still, through dry seasons and moister, <br>
One god had a wreath to his <mark4>shrine;</mark4><br>
Then love was the pearl of his <mark4>oyster,</mark4><br>
And Venus rose red out of <mark1>wine.</mark1><br>
We have all done amiss, choosing <mark4>rather</mark4><br>
Such loves as the wise gods <mark4>disdain;</mark4><br>
Intercede for us thou with thy <mark4>father,</mark4><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
In spring he had crowns of his <mark4>garden,</mark4><br>
Red corn in the heat of the <mark4>year,</mark4><br>
Then hoary green olives that <mark3>harden</mark3><br>
When the grape-blossom freezes with <mark3>fear;</mark3><br>
And milk-budded myrtles with <mark4>Venus</mark4><br>
And vine-leaves with Bacchus he <mark4>trod;</mark4><br>
And ye said, "We have seen, he hath seen <mark1>us,</mark1><br>
A visible <mark3>God."</mark3><br>
<br>
What broke off the garlands that girt <mark1>you?</mark1><br>
What sundered you spirit and <mark3>clay?</mark3><br>
Weak sins yet alive are as <mark1>virtue</mark1><br>
To the strength of the sins of that <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
For dried is the blood of thy <mark1>lover,</mark1><br>
Ipsithilla, contracted the <mark4>vein;</mark4><br>
Cry aloud, "Will he rise and <mark3>recover,</mark3><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain?"</mark1><br>
<br>
Cry aloud; for the old world is <mark4>broken:</mark4><br>
Cry <mark4>out</mark4>, for the Phrygian is <mark4>priest,</mark4><br>
And rears not the bountiful <mark3>token</mark3><br>
And spreads not the fatherly <mark3>feast.</mark3><br>
From the midmost of Ida, from <mark4>shady</mark4><br>
Recesses that murmur at <mark4>morn,</mark4><br>
They have brought and baptized her, Our <mark3>Lady,</mark3><br>
A goddess <mark4>new-born.</mark4><br>
<br>
And the chaplets of old are above <mark1>us,</mark1><br>
And the oyster-bed teems out of <mark3>reach;</mark3><br>
Old poets outsing and outlove <mark1>us,</mark1><br>
And Catullus makes mouths at our <mark3>speech.</mark3><br>
Who shall kiss, in thy father's own <mark4>city,</mark4><br>
With such lips as he sang with, <mark4>again?</mark4><br>
Intercede for us all of thy <mark3>pity,</mark3><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
Out of Dindymus heavily <mark4>laden</mark4><br>
      Her lions draw bound and unfed <br>
A mother, a mortal, a <mark3>maiden,</mark3><br>
A queen over death and the <mark4>dead.</mark4><br>
She is cold, and her habit is <mark4>lowly,</mark4><br>
      Her temple of branches and sods; <br>
Most fruitful and virginal, <mark3>holy,</mark3><br>
A mother of <mark1>gods.</mark1><br>
<br>
She hath wasted with fire thine high <mark4>places,</mark4><br>
She hath hidden and marred and made <mark4>sad</mark4><br>
The fair limbs of the <mark4>Loves</mark4>, the fair <mark1>faces</mark1><br>
Of gods that were goodly and <mark3>glad.</mark3><br>
She slays, and her hands are not <mark1>bloody;</mark1><br>
She moves as a moon in the <mark4>wane,</mark4><br>
White-robed, and thy raiment is <mark3>ruddy,</mark3><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
They shall pass and their places be <mark4>taken,</mark4><br>
The gods and the priests that are <mark4>pure.</mark4><br>
They shall pass, and shalt thou not be <mark1>shaken?</mark1><br>
They shall perish, and shalt thou <mark3>endure?</mark3><br>
Death <mark4>laughs</mark4>, breathing close and <mark4>relentless</mark4><br>
In the nostrils and eyelids of <mark1>lust,</mark1><br>
With a pinch in his fingers of scentless <br>
And delicate <mark1>dust.</mark1><br>
<br>
But the worm shall revive thee with <mark4>kisses;</mark4><br>
Thou shalt change and transmute as a <mark1>god,</mark1><br>
As the rod to a serpent that <mark3>hisses,</mark3><br>
As the serpent again to a <mark3>rod.</mark3><br>
Thy life shall not cease though thou doff <mark4>it;</mark4><br>
Thou shalt live until evil be <mark4>slain,</mark4><br>
And good shall die <mark4>first</mark4>, said thy <mark4>prophet,</mark4><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
Did he lie? did he laugh? does he know <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
Now he lies out of reach, out of <mark1>breath,</mark1><br>
Thy prophet, thy preacher, thy <mark4>poet,</mark4><br>
Sin's child by incestuous <mark1>Death?</mark1><br>
Did he find out in fire at his <mark4>waking,</mark4><br>
Or discern as his eyelids lost <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
When the bands of the body were <mark3>breaking</mark3><br>
And all came in <mark3>sight?</mark3><br>
<br>
Who has known all the evil before <mark1>us,</mark1><br>
Or the tyrannous secrets of <mark1>time?</mark1><br>
Though we match not the dead men that bore <mark1>us</mark1><br>
At a song, at a kiss, at a crime <mark3>--</mark3><br>
Though the heathen outface and outlive <mark1>us,</mark1><br>
And our lives and our longings are twain <mark3>--</mark3><br>
Ah, forgive us our virtues, forgive <mark1>us,</mark1><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
Who are we that embalm and embrace <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
With spices and savours of <mark4>song?</mark4><br>
What is time, that his children should face <mark1>thee?</mark1><br>
What am I, that my lips do thee <mark3>wrong?</mark3><br>
I could hurt thee -- but pain would delight <mark1>thee;</mark1><br>
Or caress thee -- but love would <mark4>repel;</mark4><br>
And the lovers whose lips would excite <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
Are serpents in <mark1>hell.</mark1><br>
<br>
Who now shall content thee as they <mark4>did,</mark4><br>
Thy lovers, when temples were <mark4>built</mark4><br>
And the hair of the sacrifice <mark3>braided</mark3><br>
And the blood of the sacrifice <mark3>spilt,</mark3><br>
In Lampsacus fervent with <mark1>faces,</mark1><br>
In Aphaca red from thy <mark3>reign,</mark3><br>
Who embraced thee with awful <mark1>embraces,</mark1><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain?</mark1><br>
<br>
Where are they, Cotytto or <mark1>Venus,</mark1><br>
Astarte or Ashtaroth, <mark4>where?</mark4><br>
Do their hands as we touch come between <mark1>us?</mark1><br>
Is the breath of them hot in thy <mark3>hair?</mark3><br>
From their lips have thy lips taken <mark4>fever,</mark4><br>
With the blood of their bodies grown <mark4>red?</mark4><br>
Hast thou left upon earth a <mark3>believer</mark3><br>
If these men are <mark1>dead?</mark1><br>
<br>
They were purple of raiment and <mark4>golden,</mark4><br>
Filled full of thee, fiery with <mark1>wine,</mark1><br>
Thy lovers, in haunts unbeholden, <br>
In marvellous chambers of <mark1>thine.</mark1><br>
They are fled, and their footprints escape <mark1>us,</mark1><br>
Who appraise thee, adore, and <mark4>abstain,</mark4><br>
O daughter of Death and <mark1>Priapus,</mark1><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
<br>
What ails us to fear <mark5>overmeasure,</mark5><br>
To praise thee with timorous <mark1>breath,</mark1><br>
O mistress and mother of <mark1>pleasure,</mark1><br>
The one thing as certain as <mark1>death?</mark1><br>
We shall change as the things that we <mark3>cherish,</mark3><br>
Shall fade as they faded <mark4>before,</mark4><br>
As foam upon water shall <mark3>perish,</mark3><br>
As sand upon <mark3>shore.</mark3><br>
<br>
We shall know what the darkness <mark4>discovers,</mark4><br>
If the grave-pit be shallow or <mark3>deep;</mark3><br>
And our fathers of old, and our <mark1>lovers,</mark1><br>
We shall know if they sleep not or <mark3>sleep.</mark3><br>
We shall see whether hell be not <mark1>heaven,</mark1><br>
Find out whether tares be not <mark4>grain,</mark4><br>
And the joys of thee seventy times <mark1>seven,</mark1><br>
Our Lady of <mark1>Pain.</mark1><br>
