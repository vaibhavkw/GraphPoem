Title : The Maid's Lament <br>
Author : Walter Savage Landor <br><br>

I loved him not; and yet, now he is <mark4>gone,</mark4><br>
I feel I am <mark4>alone.</mark4><br>
I check'd him while he spoke; yet, could he <mark4>speak,</mark4><br>
Alas! I would not <mark4>check.</mark4><br>
For reasons not to love him once I <mark3>sought,</mark3><br>
And wearied all my <mark3>thought</mark3><br>
To vex myself and him: I now would <mark3>give</mark3><br>
My love could he but <mark3>live</mark3><br>
Who lately lived for me, <mark4>and</mark4>, when he <mark4>found</mark4><br>
'Twas vain, in holy <mark3>ground</mark3><br>
He hid his face amid the shades of <mark3>death.</mark3><br>
I waste for him my <mark3>breath</mark3><br>
Who wasted his for me! but mine <mark3>returns,</mark3><br>
And this lorn bosom <mark3>burns</mark3><br>
With stifling heat, heaving it up in <mark3>sleep,</mark3><br>
And waking me to <mark3>weep</mark3><br>
Tears that had melted his soft heart: for <mark4>years</mark4><br>
Wept he as bitter <mark3>tears.</mark3><br>
Merciful God! such was his latest <mark3>prayer,</mark3><br>
These may she never <mark3>share.</mark3><br>
Quieter is his breath, his breast more <mark4>cold,</mark4><br>
Than daisies in the <mark3>mould,</mark3><br>
Where children spell, athwart the churchyard <mark4>gate,</mark4><br>
His name and life's brief <mark3>date.</mark3><br>
Pray for him, gentle souls, whoe'er you <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
And oh! pray too for <mark3>me!</mark3><br>
