Title : The Building of the Ship <br>
Author : Henry Wadsworth Longfellow <br><br>

"Build me straight, O worthy <mark3>Master!</mark3><br>
Stanch and strong, a goodly <mark3>vessel,</mark3><br>
That shall laugh at all <mark3>disaster,</mark3><br>
And with wave and whirlwind <mark3>wrestle!"</mark3><br>
<br>
The merchant's <mark3>word</mark3><br>
Delighted the Master <mark3>heard;</mark3><br>
For his heart was in his work, and the <mark5>heart</mark5><br>
Giveth grace unto every <mark3>Art.</mark3><br>
A quiet smile played round his <mark3>lips,</mark3><br>
As the eddies and dimples of the <mark4>tide</mark4><br>
Play round the bows of <mark3>ships,</mark3><br>
That steadily at anchor <mark3>ride.</mark3><br>
And with a voice that was full of <mark3>glee,</mark3><br>
He answered, "Erelong we will <mark4>launch</mark4><br>
A vessel as goodly, and strong, and <mark4>stanch,</mark4><br>
As ever weathered a wintry <mark3>sea!"</mark3><br>
And first with nicest skill and <mark1>art,</mark1><br>
Perfect and finished in every <mark3>part,</mark3><br>
A little model the Master <mark4>wrought,</mark4><br>
Which should be to the larger <mark3>plan</mark3><br>
What the child is to the <mark3>man,</mark3><br>
Its counterpart in <mark4>miniature;</mark4><br>
That with a hand more swift and <mark4>sure</mark4><br>
The greater labor might be <mark3>brought</mark3><br>
To answer to his inward <mark3>thought.</mark3><br>
And as he labored, his mind ran <mark4>o'er</mark4><br>
The various ships that were built of <mark4>yore,</mark4><br>
And above them <mark1>all</mark1>, and strangest of <mark4>all</mark4><br>
Towered the Great Harry, crank and <mark3>tall,</mark3><br>
Whose picture was hanging on the <mark3>wall,</mark3><br>
With bows and stern raised high in <mark4>air,</mark4><br>
And balconies hanging here and <mark3>there,</mark3><br>
And signal lanterns and flags <mark4>afloat,</mark4><br>
And eight round towers, like those that <mark4>frown</mark4><br>
From some old castle, looking <mark3>down</mark3><br>
Upon the drawbridge and the <mark3>moat.</mark3><br>
And he said with a smile, "Our ship, I <mark4>wis,</mark4><br>
Shall be of another form than <mark3>this!"</mark3><br>
It was of another form, <mark4>indeed;</mark4><br>
Built for freight, and yet for <mark3>speed,</mark3><br>
A beautiful and gallant <mark4>craft;</mark4><br>
Broad in the beam, that the stress of the <mark4>blast,</mark4><br>
Pressing down upon sail and <mark3>mast,</mark3><br>
Might not the sharp bows <mark3>overwhelm;</mark3><br>
Broad in the beam, but sloping <mark4>aft</mark4><br>
With graceful curve and slow <mark4>degrees,</mark4><br>
That she might be docile to the <mark3>helm,</mark3><br>
And that the currents of parted <mark3>seas,</mark3><br>
Closing behind, with mighty <mark4>force,</mark4><br>
Might aid and not impede her <mark3>course.</mark3><br>
<br>
In the ship-yard stood the <mark1>Master,</mark1><br>
With the model of the <mark1>vessel,</mark1><br>
That should laugh at all <mark1>disaster,</mark1><br>
And with wave and whirlwind <mark1>wrestle!</mark1><br>
Covering many a rood of <mark4>ground,</mark4><br>
Lay the timber piled <mark3>around;</mark3><br>
Timber of chestnut, and elm, and <mark4>oak,</mark4><br>
And scattered here and there, with <mark3>these,</mark3><br>
The knarred and crooked cedar <mark3>knees;</mark3><br>
Brought from regions far <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
From Pascagoula's sunny <mark3>bay,</mark3><br>
And the banks of the roaring <mark4>Roanoke!</mark4><br>
Ah! what a wondrous thing it <mark4>is</mark4><br>
To note how many wheels of <mark4>toil</mark4><br>
One thought, one word, can set in <mark4>motion!</mark4><br>
There 's not a ship that sails the <mark3>ocean,</mark3><br>
But every climate, every <mark3>soil,</mark3><br>
Must bring its tribute, great or <mark4>small,</mark4><br>
And help to build the wooden <mark1>wall!</mark1><br>
<br>
The sun was rising o'er the <mark1>sea,</mark1><br>
And long the level shadows <mark3>lay,</mark3><br>
As if they, too, the beams would <mark3>be</mark3><br>
Of some great, airy <mark4>argosy,</mark4><br>
Framed and launched in a single <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
That silent architect, the <mark4>sun,</mark4><br>
Had hewn and laid them every <mark3>one,</mark3><br>
Ere the work of man was yet <mark3>begun.</mark3><br>
Beside the Master, when he <mark4>spoke,</mark4><br>
A youth, against an anchor <mark3>leaning,</mark3><br>
Listened, to catch his slightest <mark3>meaning.</mark3><br>
Only the long waves, as they <mark3>broke</mark3><br>
In ripples on the pebbly <mark4>beach,</mark4><br>
Interrupted the old man's <mark3>speech.</mark3><br>
Beautiful they were, in sooth, <br>
The old man and the fiery <mark4>youth!</mark4><br>
The old <mark4>man</mark4>, in whose busy <mark4>brain</mark4><br>
Many a ship that sailed the <mark3>main</mark3><br>
Was modelled o'er and o'er again; <mark3>--</mark3><br>
The fiery youth, who was to <mark1>be</mark1><br>
The heir of his <mark4>dexterity,</mark4><br>
The heir of his house, and his daughter's <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
When he had built and launched from <mark3>land</mark3><br>
What the elder head had <mark3>planned.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Thus," said he, "will we build this <mark5>ship!</mark5><br>
Lay square the blocks upon the <mark3>slip,</mark3><br>
And follow well this plan of <mark4>mine.</mark4><br>
Choose the timbers with greatest <mark3>care;</mark3><br>
Of all that is unsound <mark3>beware;</mark3><br>
For only what is sound and <mark4>strong</mark4><br>
To this vessel shall <mark3>belong.</mark3><br>
Cedar of Maine and Georgia <mark3>pine</mark3><br>
Here together shall <mark3>combine.</mark3><br>
A goodly <mark3>frame</mark3>, and a goodly <mark4>fame,</mark4><br>
And the Union be her <mark3>name!</mark3><br>
For the day that gives her to the <mark1>sea</mark1><br>
Shall give my daughter unto <mark3>thee!"</mark3><br>
<br>
The Master's <mark1>word</mark1><br>
Enraptured the young man <mark1>heard;</mark1><br>
And as he turned his face <mark4>aside,</mark4><br>
With a look of joy and a thrill of <mark3>pride</mark3><br>
Standing <mark4>before</mark4><br>
Her father's <mark3>door,</mark3><br>
He saw the form of his promised <mark3>bride.</mark3><br>
The sun shone on her golden <mark4>hair,</mark4><br>
And her cheek was glowing fresh and <mark3>fair,</mark3><br>
With the breath of morn and the soft sea <mark1>air.</mark1><br>
Like a beauteous barge was <mark3>she,</mark3><br>
Still at rest on the sandy <mark1>beach,</mark1><br>
Just beyond the billow's <mark3>reach;</mark3><br>
But <mark3>he</mark3><br>
Was the restless, seething, stormy <mark1>sea!</mark1><br>
Ah, how skilful grows the <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
That obeyeth Love's <mark3>command!</mark3><br>
It is the heart, and not the <mark1>brain,</mark1><br>
That to the highest doth <mark3>attain,</mark3><br>
And he who followeth Love's <mark4>behest</mark4><br>
Far excelleth all the <mark3>rest!</mark3><br>
<br>
Thus with the rising of the <mark1>sun</mark1><br>
Was the noble task <mark1>begun,</mark1><br>
And soon throughout the ship-yard's <mark4>bounds</mark4><br>
Were heard the intermingled <mark3>sounds</mark3><br>
Of axes and of mallets, <mark4>plied</mark4><br>
With vigorous arms on every <mark3>side;</mark3><br>
Plied so deftly and so <mark4>well,</mark4><br>
That, ere the shadows of evening <mark3>fell,</mark3><br>
The keel of oak for a noble <mark1>ship,</mark1><br>
Scarfed and bolted, straight and <mark1>strong,</mark1><br>
Was lying ready, and stretched <mark3>along</mark3><br>
The blocks, well placed upon the <mark1>slip.</mark1><br>
Happy, thrice happy, every <mark1>one</mark1><br>
Who sees his labor well <mark1>begun,</mark1><br>
And not perplexed and <mark4>multiplied,</mark4><br>
By idly waiting for time and <mark1>tide!</mark1><br>
<br>
And when the hot, long day was <mark1>o'er,</mark1><br>
The young man at the Master's <mark1>door</mark1><br>
Sat with the maiden calm and <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
And within the porch, a little <mark3>more</mark3><br>
Removed beyond the evening <mark3>chill,</mark3><br>
The father sat, and told them <mark4>tales</mark4><br>
Of wrecks in the great September <mark3>gales,</mark3><br>
Of pirates coasting the Spanish <mark1>Main,</mark1><br>
And ships that never came back <mark1>again,</mark1><br>
The chance and change of a sailor's <mark3>life,</mark3><br>
Want and plenty, rest and <mark3>strife,</mark3><br>
His roving fancy, like the <mark4>wind,</mark4><br>
That nothing can stay and nothing can <mark3>bind,</mark3><br>
And the magic charm of foreign <mark4>lands,</mark4><br>
With shadows of <mark4>palms</mark4>, and shining <mark3>sands,</mark3><br>
Where the tumbling <mark4>surf,</mark4><br>
O'er the coral reefs of <mark4>Madagascar,</mark4><br>
Washes the feet of the swarthy Lascar, <br>
As he lies alone and asleep on the <mark3>turf.</mark3><br>
And the trembling maiden held her <mark4>breath</mark4><br>
At the tales of that awful, pitiless <mark1>sea,</mark1><br>
With all its terror and <mark4>mystery,</mark4><br>
The dim, dark sea, so like unto <mark3>Death,</mark3><br>
That divides and yet unites <mark3>mankind!</mark3><br>
And whenever the old man paused, a <mark4>gleam</mark4><br>
From the bowl of his pipe would awhile illume <br>
The silent group in the twilight <mark4>gloom,</mark4><br>
And thoughtful faces, as in a <mark4>dream;</mark4><br>
And for a moment one might <mark4>mark</mark4><br>
What had been hidden by the <mark3>dark,</mark3><br>
<br>
That the head of the maiden lay at <mark1>rest,</mark1><br>
Tenderly, on the young man's <mark3>breast!</mark3><br>
<br>
Day by day the vessel <mark3>grew,</mark3><br>
With timbers fashioned strong and <mark3>true,</mark3><br>
Stemson and keelson and <mark3>sternson-knee,</mark3><br>
Till, framed with perfect <mark4>symmetry,</mark4><br>
A skeleton ship rose up to <mark3>view!</mark3><br>
And around the bows and along the <mark1>side</mark1><br>
The heavy hammers and mallets <mark1>plied,</mark1><br>
Till after many a week, at <mark4>length,</mark4><br>
Wonderful for form and <mark3>strength,</mark3><br>
Sublime in its enormous <mark4>bulk,</mark4><br>
Loomed aloft the shadowy <mark3>hulk!</mark3><br>
And around it columns of smoke, upwreathing, <br>
Rose from the boiling, <mark4>bubbling</mark4>, <mark4>seething</mark4><br>
Caldron, that <mark4>glowed,</mark4><br>
And <mark3>overflowed</mark3><br>
With the black tar, heated for the <mark3>sheathing.</mark3><br>
And amid the clamors <br>
Of clattering <mark4>hammers,</mark4><br>
He who listened heard now and <mark3>then</mark3><br>
The song of the Master and his men: <mark3>--</mark3><br>
<br>
"Build me straight, O worthy <mark1>Master,</mark1><br>
Staunch and strong, a goodly <mark1>vessel,</mark1><br>
That shall laugh at all <mark1>disaster,</mark1><br>
And with wave and whirlwind <mark1>wrestle!"</mark1><br>
<br>
With oaken brace and copper <mark4>band,</mark4><br>
Lay the rudder on the <mark3>sand,</mark3><br>
That, like a thought, should have <mark4>control</mark4><br>
Over the movement of the <mark3>whole;</mark3><br>
And near it the anchor, whose giant <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
Would reach down and grapple with the <mark1>land,</mark1><br>
And immovable and <mark4>fast</mark4><br>
Hold the great ship against the bellowing <mark1>blast!</mark1><br>
And at the bows an image <mark4>stood,</mark4><br>
By a cunning artist carved in <mark3>wood,</mark3><br>
With robes of white, that far <mark4>behind</mark4><br>
Seemed to be fluttering in the <mark1>wind.</mark1><br>
It was not shaped in a classic <mark4>mould,</mark4><br>
Not like a Nymph or Goddess of <mark3>old,</mark3><br>
Or Naiad rising from the <mark4>water,</mark4><br>
But modelled from the Master's <mark3>daughter!</mark3><br>
On many a dreary and misty <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
'T will be seen by the rays of the signal <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
Speeding along through the rain and the <mark1>dark,</mark1><br>
Like a ghost in its snow-white <mark3>sark,</mark3><br>
The pilot of some phantom <mark3>bark,</mark3><br>
Guiding the vessel, in its <mark3>flight,</mark3><br>
By a path none other knows aright! <br>
<br>
Behold, at <mark4>last,</mark4><br>
Each tall and tapering <mark1>mast</mark1><br>
Is swung into its <mark4>place;</mark4><br>
Shrouds and <mark4>stays</mark4><br>
Holding it firm and <mark1>fast!</mark1><br>
<br>
Long <mark3>ago,</mark3><br>
In the deer-haunted forests of <mark4>Maine,</mark4><br>
When upon mountain and <mark3>plain</mark3><br>
Lay the <mark3>snow,</mark3><br>
They fell, -- those lordly <mark4>pines!</mark4><br>
Those grand, majestic <mark1>pines!</mark1><br>
'Mid shouts and <mark4>cheers</mark4><br>
The jaded <mark3>steers,</mark3><br>
Panting beneath the <mark4>goad,</mark4><br>
Dragged down the weary, winding <mark3>road</mark3><br>
Those captive kings so straight and <mark1>tall,</mark1><br>
To be shorn of their streaming <mark1>hair,</mark1><br>
And naked and <mark3>bare,</mark3><br>
To feel the stress and the <mark3>strain</mark3><br>
Of the wind and the reeling <mark1>main,</mark1><br>
Whose <mark4>roar</mark4><br>
Would remind them <mark5>forevermore</mark5><br>
Of their native forests they should not see <mark1>again.</mark1><br>
And <mark4>everywhere</mark4><br>
The slender, graceful spars <br>
Poise aloft in the <mark1>air,</mark1><br>
And at the <mark4>mast-head,</mark4><br>
White, blue, and <mark4>red,</mark4><br>
A flag unrolls the stripes and <mark4>stars.</mark4><br>
Ah! when the wanderer, lonely, friendless, <br>
In foreign harbors shall <mark4>behold</mark4><br>
That flag <mark3>unrolled,</mark3><br>
'T will be as a friendly <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
Stretched out from his native <mark1>land,</mark1><br>
Filling his heart with memories sweet and <mark4>endless!</mark4><br>
<br>
All is finished! and at <mark1>length</mark1><br>
Has come the bridal <mark1>day</mark1><br>
Of beauty and of <mark1>strength.</mark1><br>
To-day the vessel shall be <mark4>launched!</mark4><br>
With fleecy clouds the sky is <mark5>blanched,</mark5><br>
And o'er the <mark1>bay,</mark1><br>
Slowly, in all his splendors dight, <br>
The great sun rises to behold the <mark4>sight.</mark4><br>
<br>
The ocean <mark1>old,</mark1><br>
Centuries <mark1>old,</mark1><br>
Strong as youth, and as <mark3>uncontrolled,</mark3><br>
Paces restless to and <mark3>fro,</mark3><br>
Up and down the sands of <mark3>gold.</mark3><br>
His beating heart is not at <mark1>rest;</mark1><br>
And far and <mark4>wide,</mark4><br>
With ceaseless <mark3>flow,</mark3><br>
His beard of <mark1>snow</mark1><br>
Heaves with the heaving of his <mark1>breast.</mark1><br>
He waits impatient for his <mark1>bride.</mark1><br>
There she <mark4>stands,</mark4><br>
With her foot upon the <mark1>sands,</mark1><br>
Decked with flags and streamers <mark3>gay,</mark3><br>
In honor of her marriage <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
Her snow-white signals <mark4>fluttering</mark4>, <mark4>blending,</mark4><br>
Round her like a veil <mark3>descending,</mark3><br>
Ready to <mark1>be</mark1><br>
The bride of the gray old <mark1>sea.</mark1><br>
<br>
On the deck another <mark1>bride</mark1><br>
Is standing by her lover's <mark1>side.</mark1><br>
Shadows from the flags and <mark4>shrouds,</mark4><br>
Like the shadows cast by <mark3>clouds,</mark3><br>
Broken by many a sunny <mark4>fleck,</mark4><br>
Fall around them on the <mark3>deck.</mark3><br>
<br>
The prayer is <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
The service <mark3>read,</mark3><br>
The joyous bridegroom bows his <mark3>head;</mark3><br>
And in tears the good old <mark1>Master</mark1><br>
Shakes the brown hand of his <mark4>son,</mark4><br>
Kisses his daughter's glowing <mark4>cheek</mark4><br>
In silence, for he cannot <mark3>speak,</mark3><br>
And ever <mark3>faster</mark3><br>
Down his own the tears begin to <mark3>run.</mark3><br>
The worthy pastor <mark3>--</mark3><br>
The shepherd of that wandering <mark4>flock,</mark4><br>
That has the ocean for its <mark4>wold,</mark4><br>
That has the vessel for its <mark3>fold,</mark3><br>
Leaping ever from rock to rock <mark3>--</mark3><br>
Spake, with accents mild and <mark4>clear,</mark4><br>
Words of warning, words of <mark3>cheer,</mark3><br>
But tedious to the bridegroom's <mark3>ear.</mark3><br>
He knew the <mark4>chart</mark4><br>
Of the sailor's <mark1>heart,</mark1><br>
All its pleasures and its griefs, <br>
All its shallows and rocky <mark4>reefs,</mark4><br>
All those secret currents, that <mark1>flow</mark1><br>
With such resistless undertow, <br>
And lift and drift, with terrible <mark1>force,</mark1><br>
The will from its moorings and its <mark1>course.</mark1><br>
Therefore he spake, and thus said he: <mark1>--</mark1><br>
<br>
"Like unto ships far off at <mark1>sea,</mark1><br>
Outward or homeward bound, are <mark3>we.</mark3><br>
Before, <mark4>behind</mark4>, and all <mark1>around,</mark1><br>
Floats and swings the horizon's <mark3>bound,</mark3><br>
Seems at its distant rim to <mark4>rise</mark4><br>
And climb the crystal wall of the <mark3>skies,</mark3><br>
And then again to turn and <mark4>sink,</mark4><br>
As if we could slide from its outer <mark3>brink.</mark3><br>
Ah! it is not the <mark1>sea,</mark1><br>
It is not the sea that sinks and <mark4>shelves,</mark4><br>
But <mark3>ourselves</mark3><br>
That rock and <mark1>rise</mark1><br>
With endless and uneasy <mark1>motion,</mark1><br>
Now touching the very <mark1>skies,</mark1><br>
Now sinking into the depths of <mark1>ocean.</mark1><br>
Ah! if our souls but poise and <mark4>swing</mark4><br>
Like the compass in its brazen <mark3>ring,</mark3><br>
Ever level and ever <mark1>true</mark1><br>
To the toil and the task we have to <mark3>do,</mark3><br>
We shall sail securely, and safely <mark1>reach</mark1><br>
The Fortunate Isles, on whose shining <mark1>beach</mark1><br>
The sights we see, and the sounds we <mark3>hear,</mark3><br>
Will be those of joy and not of <mark4>fear!"</mark4><br>
<br>
Then the <mark1>Master,</mark1><br>
With a gesture of <mark1>command,</mark1><br>
Waved his <mark1>hand;</mark1><br>
And at the <mark1>word,</mark1><br>
Loud and sudden there was <mark1>heard,</mark1><br>
All around them and <mark3>below,</mark3><br>
The sound of hammers, blow on <mark3>blow,</mark3><br>
Knocking away the shores and <mark4>spurs.</mark4><br>
And see! she <mark3>stirs!</mark3><br>
She starts, -- she moves, -- she seems to <mark4>feel</mark4><br>
The thrill of life along her <mark3>keel,</mark3><br>
<mark4>And</mark4>, spurning with her foot the <mark1>ground,</mark1><br>
With one exulting, joyous <mark1>bound,</mark1><br>
She leaps into the ocean's <mark4>arms!</mark4><br>
<br>
And lo! from the assembled <mark4>crowd</mark4><br>
There rose a shout, prolonged and <mark3>loud,</mark3><br>
That to the ocean seemed to <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
"Take her, O bridegroom, old and <mark3>gray,</mark3><br>
Take her to thy protecting <mark1>arms,</mark1><br>
With all her youth and all her <mark3>charms!"</mark3><br>
<br>
How beautiful she is! How <mark1>fair</mark1><br>
She lies within those arms, that <mark4>press</mark4><br>
Her form with many a soft <mark3>caress</mark3><br>
Of tenderness and watchful <mark1>care!</mark1><br>
Sail forth into the sea, O <mark1>ship!</mark1><br>
Through wind and wave, right onward <mark4>steer!</mark4><br>
The moistened eye, the trembling <mark3>lip,</mark3><br>
Are not the signs of doubt or <mark1>fear.</mark1><br>
Sail forth into the sea of <mark1>life,</mark1><br>
O gentle, loving, trusting <mark3>wife,</mark3><br>
And safe from all adversity <br>
Upon the bosom of that <mark1>sea</mark1><br>
Thy comings and thy goings <mark1>be!</mark1><br>
For gentleness and love and <mark4>trust</mark4><br>
Prevail o'er angry wave and <mark3>gust;</mark3><br>
And in the wreck of noble <mark4>lives</mark4><br>
Something immortal still <mark3>survives!</mark3><br>
<br>
Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of <mark4>State!</mark4><br>
Sail on, O Union, strong and <mark3>great!</mark3><br>
Humanity with all its <mark4>fears,</mark4><br>
With all the hopes of future <mark3>years,</mark3><br>
Is hanging breathless on thy <mark3>fate!</mark3><br>
We know what Master laid thy <mark1>keel,</mark1><br>
What Workmen wrought thy ribs of <mark3>steel,</mark3><br>
Who made each mast, and sail, and <mark4>rope,</mark4><br>
What anvils rang, what hammers <mark4>beat,</mark4><br>
In what a forge and what a <mark3>heat</mark3><br>
Were shaped the anchors of thy <mark3>hope!</mark3><br>
Fear not each sudden sound and <mark4>shock,</mark4><br>
'T is of the wave and not the <mark1>rock;</mark1><br>
'T is but the flapping of the <mark4>sail,</mark4><br>
And not a rent made by the <mark3>gale!</mark3><br>
In spite of rock and tempest's <mark1>roar,</mark1><br>
In spite of false lights on the <mark3>shore,</mark3><br>
Sail on, nor fear to breast the <mark1>sea!</mark1><br>
Our hearts, our hopes, are all with <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
Our hearts, our hopes, our <mark3>prayers</mark3>, our <mark3>tears,</mark3><br>
Our faith triumphant o'er our <mark1>fears,</mark1><br>
Are all with <mark1>thee</mark1>, -- are all with <mark1>thee!</mark1><br>
