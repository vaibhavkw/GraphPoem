Title : The Springtime <br>
Author : Denise Levertov <br><br>

The red eyes of <mark4>rabbits</mark4><br>
aren't sad. No one <mark4>passes</mark4><br>
the sad golden village in a barge <br>
any more. The <mark4>sunset</mark4><br>
will leave it alone. If <mark4>the</mark4><br>
curtains hang <mark3>askew</mark3><br>
it is no one's <mark4>fault.</mark4><br>
Around and around and <mark3>around</mark3><br>
everywhere the same <mark3>sound</mark3><br>
of wheels going, and <mark4>things</mark4><br>
growing older, growing   <br>
silent. If the <mark4>dogs</mark4><br>
bark to each other <br>
all night, and their <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
flash red, <mark4>that's</mark4><br>
nobody's business. They have   <br>
a great space of dark <mark3>to</mark3><br>
bark <mark4>across</mark4>, The <mark1>rabbits</mark1><br>
will bare their teeth <mark4>at</mark4><br>
the spring <mark4>moon.</mark4><br>
