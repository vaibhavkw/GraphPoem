PLACE. --A small alcove with dark <mark4>curtains.</mark4><br>
The class consists of one <mark4>member.</mark4><br>
            SUBJECT.--Thomson's Mirror Galvanometer.<br>
The lamp-light falls on blackened <mark4>walls,</mark4><br>
<br>
And streams through narrow <mark4>perforations,</mark4><br>
The long beam trails o'er pasteboard <mark4>scales,</mark4><br>
With slow-decaying <mark4>oscillations.</mark4><br>
Flow, current, flow, set the quick light-spot <mark3>flying,</mark3><br>
Flow current, answer light-spot, flashing, <mark4>quivering</mark4>, <mark3>dying,</mark3><br>
O look! how queer! how thin and <mark4>clear,</mark4><br>
<br>
And thinner, clearer, sharper <mark4>growing</mark4><br>
The gliding fire! with central <mark4>wire,</mark4><br>
The fine degrees distinctly <mark3>showing.</mark3><br>
Swing, magnet, <mark4>swing</mark4>, advancing and <mark4>receding,</mark4><br>
Swing magnet! Answer dearest, What's your final <mark3>reading?</mark3><br>
O love! you fail to read the <mark5>scale</mark5><br>
<br>
Correct to tenths of a <mark4>division.</mark4><br>
To mirror heaven those eyes were <mark4>given,</mark4><br>
And not for methods of <mark4>precision.</mark4><br>
Break contact, break, set the free light-spot <mark1>flying;</mark1><br>
Break contact, rest thee, magnet, swinging, <mark4>creeping</mark4>, <mark1>dying.</mark1><br>
       Professor Chrschtschonovitsch, Ph.D., "On the C. G. S. system<br>
<br>
of <mark4>Units."</mark4><br>
<br>
Remarks submitted to the Lecturer by a <mark4>student</mark4><br>
Prim Doctor of <mark4>Philosophy</mark4><br>
      Front academic Heidelberg!<br>
Your sum of vital <mark4>energy</mark4><br>
<br>
      Is not the millionth of an erg.<br>
Your liveliest motion might be <mark5>reckoned</mark5><br>
At one Tenth-metre in a <mark3>second.</mark3><br>
"The air," you said, in language <mark4>fine,</mark4><br>
Which scientific thought <mark4>expresses,</mark4><br>
"The air--which with a <mark1>megadyne,</mark1><br>
<br>
On each square centimetre <mark3>presses--</mark3><br>
The air, and I may add the <mark4>ocean,</mark4><br>
Are nought but molecules in <mark3>motion."</mark3><br>
Atoms, you told me, were <mark4>discrete,</mark4><br>
Than you they could not be <mark5>discreter,</mark5><br>
Who know how many Millions <mark3>meet</mark3><br>
<br>
Within a cubic <mark4>millimetre.</mark4><br>
They clash together as they <mark5>fly,</mark5><br>
But you!--you cannot tell me <mark3>why.</mark3><br>
And when in tuning my <mark4>guitar</mark4><br>
The interval would not come <mark4>right,</mark4><br>
"This string," you said, "is strained too <mark3>far,</mark3><br>
<br>
'Tis forty dynes, at least too <mark3>tight!"</mark3><br>
And then you told me, as I <mark4>sang,</mark4><br>
What overtones were in my <mark3>clang.</mark3><br>
You gabbled on, but every <mark4>phrase</mark4><br>
Was stiff with scientific <mark4>shoddy,</mark4><br>
The only song you deigned to <mark3>praise</mark3><br>
<br>
Was "Gin a body meet a <mark3>body,"</mark3><br>
"And even there," you said, <mark4>"collision</mark4><br>
Was not described with due <mark1>precision."</mark1><br>
"In the invariable <mark4>plane,"</mark4><br>
You told me, "lay the impulsive <mark4>couple."</mark4><br>
You seized my hand--you gave me <mark3>pain,</mark3><br>
<br>
By torsion of a wrist so <mark3>supple;</mark3><br>
You told me what that wrench would <mark3>do,--</mark3><br>
"'Twould set me twisting round a <mark3>screw."</mark3><br>
Were every hair of every <mark4>tress</mark4><br>
(Which you, no doubt, imagine <mark4>mine),</mark4><br>
Drawn towards you with its breaking <mark3>stress--</mark3><br>
<br>
A stress, say, of a <mark1>megadyne,</mark1><br>
That tension I would sooner <mark4>suffer</mark4><br>
Than meet again with such a <mark3>duffer!</mark3><br>
