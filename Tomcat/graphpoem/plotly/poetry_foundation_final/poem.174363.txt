Title : Sonnet 64: When I have seen <br>
Author : Time's fell hand defac'd <br><br>

When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd <br>
The rich proud cost of outworn buried <mark3>age;</mark3><br>
When sometime lofty towers I see down-ras'd <br>
And brass eternal slave to mortal <mark3>rage;</mark3><br>
When I have seen the hungry ocean <mark3>gain</mark3><br>
Advantage on the kingdom of the <mark3>shore,</mark3><br>
And the firm soil win of the wat'ry <mark3>main,</mark3><br>
Increasing store with loss and loss with <mark3>store;</mark3><br>
When I have seen such interchange of <mark4>state,</mark4><br>
Or state itself confounded to <mark3>decay;</mark3><br>
Ruin hath taught me thus to <mark4>ruminate,</mark4><br>
That Time will come and take my love <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
This thought is as a death, which cannot <mark3>choose</mark3><br>
But weep to have that which it fears to <mark3>lose.</mark3><br>
