Title : The Screen of Distance <br>
Author : Barbara Guest <br><br>

<br>
On a wall shadowed by lights from the <mark4>distance</mark4><br>
is the screen. Icons come to it dressed in <mark4>capes</mark4><br>
and their eyes reflect the journeys their <mark4>nomadic</mark4><br>
eyes reach from level earth. Narratives are <mark4>in</mark4><br>
the room where the screen waits suspended <mark4>like</mark4><br>
the frame of a girder the worker will place <mark4>upon</mark4><br>
an axis and thus make a frame which he fills with   <br>
a plot or a quarter inch of poetry to encourage   <br>
nature into his building and the tree <mark4>leaning</mark4><br>
against it, the tree casting language upon the <mark4>screen.</mark4><br>
The telephone is Flaubert's parrot and it flitters   <br>
<br>
from perch to perch across the city. Or <mark4>someone</mark4><br>
<br>
is holding the dead thing in her hand in a <mark4>remote</mark4><br>
hotel. A sensitive person with a disability <mark3>who</mark3><br>
speaks to the inanimate. She may even <mark4>resemble</mark4><br>
Louise Colet or the helpful niece. She hasn't <mark4>sent</mark4><br>
her meaning and I am absent in these <mark5>reminiscences</mark5><br>
of her. The telephone is the guignol <mark1>of</mark1><br>
It may have been cold moving down from <mark4>roofs,</mark4><br>
a continental wind caught between <mark4>buildings.</mark4><br>
Leaves and pollen blowing onto fire <mark4>escapes.</mark4><br>
<br>
Windstruck hambones lying in a gutter. Equinoc- <br>
tial changes the body knows, the hand feels, <mark4>the</mark4><br>
truck passes without notice and buildings <mark4>con-</mark4><br>
tinue their nervous commitments. The earth <mark3>may</mark3><br>
have been moaning underneath this junk. I <mark4>am</mark4><br>
caught in the wind's <mark4>draft.</mark4><br>
At night viewing the screen of <mark1>distance</mark1><br>
with shadowy icons framed by <mark4>light</mark4><br>
I understood the rasping <mark4>interior</mark4><br>
was rearing other <mark4>icons,</mark4><br>
<br>
No longer gentle they flashed ripened <mark4>clauses,</mark4><br>
<br>
or images raised formidable projections of <mark4>ice,</mark4><br>
the wall was placed in a temporary <mark4>position</mark4><br>
where words glittered from a dark <mark4>cover,</mark4><br>
Narcissism lived in a silver <mark4>hut.</mark4><br>
In the lighter time of year words <mark4>arrived</mark4><br>
<br>
concealed in branches. Flaubert <mark4>exchanged</mark4><br>
himself for words, night became a night <mark1>of</mark1><br>
words and a journey a journey of words, <mark4>and</mark4><br>
so <mark4>on.</mark4><br>
<br>
Words became "a superior joke", I <mark4>trembled</mark4><br>
<br>
under a revolutionary weight, a coward <mark4>fleeing</mark4><br>
<br>
from a cloud. The ego of words stretched <mark4>to</mark4><br>
the room's borders assuming the <mark4>sonorous</mark4><br>
movement of a <mark4>poem.</mark4><br>
I entice this novice poem with a <mark4>mineral</mark4>, <mark4>Beryl.</mark4><br>
The dictionary bestows on Beryl a skittish <mark4>description,</mark4><br>
like a sequence in which a <mark3>car</mark3><br>
<br>
moves over ruptured roads and <mark4>slices</mark4><br>
into ghost veins of <mark4>color--</mark4><br>
a camera follows each <mark4>turn,</mark4><br>
examines the exits where rock <mark4>protects</mark4><br>
a visionary tool that prods <mark4>it:--</mark4><br>
<br>
"A light greenish blue that is <mark4>bluer</mark4><br>
<br>
and deeper than average <mark4>aqua,</mark4><br>
greener than robin's eggs <mark3>blue,</mark3><br>
bluer and paler than <mark4>turquoise</mark4><br>
<br>
blue and greener and deeper than <mark1>beryl</mark1><br>
blue--a light greenish blue that is <mark1>bluer</mark1><br>
and paler than beryl or average turquoise <mark1>blue--</mark1><br>
bluer and slightly paler than <mark1>aqua."</mark1><br>
The speculative use of mineral prevents <mark4>an</mark4><br>
attachment to words from overflowing, <mark4>inserts</mark4><br>
a vein of <mark4>jazz</mark4>, emblems of color and <mark4>overcomes</mark4><br>
<br>
the persecuting stretch of racetrack where <mark4>words</mark4><br>
race their mounts <mark4>....</mark4><br>
Beryl became a distraction as one speaks of <mark1>color</mark1><br>
field or someone as a colorist or of color pre- <br>
dominant, so the paper on which the poem <mark4>would</mark4><br>
rest was grainy with color flashing <mark4>lights</mark4><br>
and the depth, the deepness of the country <mark4>lane</mark4><br>
on which shadows found repose was a wilderness <mark1>of</mark1><br>
color, ditches and trees lost their contours. I   <br>
<br>
created a planned randomness in which <mark1>color</mark1><br>
behaved like a <mark3>star.</mark3><br>
To introduce color to <mark4>form</mark4><br>
I must darken the window where <mark4>shrubs</mark4><br>
grazed the delicate <mark1>words</mark1><br>
<br>
the room would <mark4>behave</mark4><br>
<br>
like everything else in <mark4>nature,</mark4><br>
Experience and emotion <mark4>performed</mark4><br>
as they did within the zone of <mark1>distance</mark1><br>
words ending in fluid <mark4>passages</mark4><br>
created a phenomenal <mark5>blush</mark5><br>
dispersing illusion <mark4>....</mark4><br>
A difficult poem intrudes like <mark4>hardware</mark4><br>
decorating a quiet <mark4>building</mark4>, a tic <mark4>taking</mark4><br>
over the facade, a shrug exaggerated by <mark3>a</mark3><br>
Shelley sailing into the loose <mark4>wind,</mark4><br>
<br>
the storm of neurosis hindering the formal <mark4>plan,</mark4><br>
<br>
a suggested dwelling left on the drawing <mark4>board</mark4><br>
with clumps of shrubs indicating hysteria <mark4>or,</mark4><br>
Daylight gleams on the rough street where <mark1>a</mark1><br>
blameless career sighs, the poet beak <mark4>dips</mark4><br>
in air, his little wings cause a mild <mark3>stir,</mark3><br>
as someone comes down the <mark4>stair</mark4><br>
<br>
he pleads with <mark4>infancy,</mark4><br>
A woman speaks to a dish, old forks, amid <mark3>her</mark3><br>
preparations she smiles touched by <mark4>history.</mark4><br>
Chipped, sundry evidences of temporal life   <br>
hiding in a bush. In formal dress <mark4>domestic</mark4><br>
<br>
remarks reel into a corpus known as <mark4>stanzas.</mark4><br>
<br>
The Bride raised the cloud settled on <mark1>her</mark1><br>
aspen head and stepping away from her <mark4>bachelors</mark4><br>
she seized like wands the poem I handed <mark1>her:</mark1><br>
"A life glitters under <mark4>leaves</mark4><br>
<br>
piled for anonymity <mark4>..."</mark4><br>
She would lead us through glass to view <mark1>the</mark1><br>
enigmatic hill where a castle slung a shadow. <br>
There was a dream within a dream and <mark4>inside</mark4><br>
the outer dream lay a rounded piece of <mark4>white</mark4><br>
<br>
marble of perfect circular <mark4>dimension.</mark4><br>
The dreamer called this marble that <mark4>resembled</mark4><br>
a grain of Grecian marble, "Eva Knachte," <br>
who was blown into the dream by the <mark4>considerate</mark4><br>
rage of <mark4>night.</mark4><br>
<br>
Her name evoking night became a marble <mark4>pebble,</mark4><br>
the land on which she rested was the <mark4>shore</mark4><br>
of the sea that washed over her and <mark4>changed</mark4><br>
her lineaments into classic marble, a <mark4>miniature</mark4><br>
being, yet perfect in this dream, her <mark4>size</mark4><br>
<br>
determined by the summer storm with <mark5>which</mark5><br>
<br>
I struggled and seized the <mark4>marble.</mark4><br>
The marble was a relic, as were the <mark4>movements</mark4><br>
of nature on the poem. The sea had <mark4>lent</mark4><br>
a frieze, waves a shoulder when the investitures   <br>
<br>
of a symbolic life feuded. In that <mark5>dimness</mark5><br>
with bristles, straw, armor plate, grotty   <br>
<br>
Alexandrines there appeared a mobile fiction <mark4>....</mark4><br>
A man who calls himself a Baron yet strays <mark4>from</mark4><br>
<br>
his estate into the cadmium yellow <br>
<br>
of a bewildering sunset rendered by <mark4>apprehension</mark4><br>
where a broad approach to a narrow <mark4>tunnel</mark4><br>
is fanned by leaves is faced with a <mark4>decision--</mark4><br>
at the stylized ominous entrance he <mark4>wonders</mark4><br>
if reality will maintain him or empathic snow   <br>
subdue his quest <mark4>....</mark4><br>
I sifted through these fictive <mark4>ambiguities</mark4><br>
until there was a plain <mark4>moment</mark4><br>
<br>
something like a black table <mark4>where</mark4><br>
Dialogue set in motion urged a <mark4>search</mark4><br>
in memory for that tonal <mark1>light</mark1><br>
illuminating the <mark1>screen,</mark1><br>
The Baron faded as distance <mark4>gleamed</mark4><br>
a clear jar multiplied by <mark4>frost.</mark4><br>
