Title : Summer Images <br>
Author : John Clare <br><br>

Now swarthy Summer, by rude health <mark5>embrowned,</mark5><br>
Precedence takes of rosy fingered <mark3>Spring;</mark3><br>
And laughing Joy, with wild flowers <mark4>prank'd</mark4>, and <mark4>crown'd,</mark4><br>
A wild and giddy <mark3>thing,</mark3><br>
And Health robust, from every care <mark4>unbound,</mark4><br>
Come on the zephyr's <mark3>wing,</mark3><br>
And cheer the toiling <mark4>clown.</mark4><br>
<br>
Happy as holiday-enjoying <mark3>face,</mark3><br>
Loud tongued, and "merry as a marriage <mark3>bell,"</mark3><br>
Thy lightsome step sheds joy in every <mark3>place;</mark3><br>
And where the troubled <mark3>dwell,</mark3><br>
Thy witching charms wean them of half their <mark4>cares;</mark4><br>
And from thy sunny <mark3>spell,</mark3><br>
They greet joy <mark3>unawares.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then with thy sultry locks all loose and <mark4>rude,</mark4><br>
And mantle laced with gems of garish <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
Come as of wont; for I would fain <mark3>intrude,</mark3><br>
And in the world's <mark3>despite,</mark3><br>
Share the rude wealth that thy own heart <mark5>beguiles;</mark5><br>
If haply so I <mark3>might</mark3><br>
Win pleasure from thy <mark4>smiles.</mark4><br>
<br>
Me not the noise of brawling pleasure <mark4>cheers,</mark4><br>
In nightly revels or in city <mark4>streets;</mark4><br>
But joys which soothe, and not distract the <mark3>ears,</mark3><br>
That one at leisure <mark3>meets</mark3><br>
In the green woods, and meadows <mark4>summer-shorn,</mark4><br>
Or fields, where bee-fly <mark3>greets</mark3><br>
The ear with mellow <mark3>horn.</mark3><br>
<br>
The green-swathed grasshopper, on treble <mark3>pipe,</mark3><br>
Sings there, and dances, in mad-hearted <mark4>pranks;</mark4><br>
There bees go courting every flower that's <mark3>ripe,</mark3><br>
On baulks and sunny <mark3>banks;</mark3><br>
And droning dragon-fly, on rude <mark4>bassoon,</mark4><br>
Attempts to give God <mark3>thanks</mark3><br>
In no discordant <mark3>tune.</mark3><br>
<br>
The speckled thrush, by self-delight <mark5>embued,</mark5><br>
There sings unto himself for joy's <mark4>amends,</mark4><br>
And drinks the honey dew of <mark4>solitude.</mark4><br>
There Happiness <mark3>attends</mark3><br>
With inbred Joy until the heart <mark4>o'erflow,</mark4><br>
Of which the world's rude <mark4>friends,</mark4><br>
         Nought heeding, nothing know.<br>
<br>
There the gay river, laughing as it <mark4>goes,</mark4><br>
Plashes with easy wave its flaggy <mark4>sides,</mark4><br>
And to the calm of heart, in calmness <mark4>shows</mark4><br>
What pleasure there <mark4>abides,</mark4><br>
To trace its sedgy banks, from trouble <mark3>free:</mark3><br>
Spots Solitude <mark3>provides</mark3><br>
To muse, and happy <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
<br>
There ruminating 'neath some pleasant <mark4>bush,</mark4><br>
On sweet silk grass I stretch me at mine <mark4>ease,</mark4><br>
Where I can pillow on the yielding <mark4>rush;</mark4><br>
And, acting as I <mark3>please,</mark3><br>
Drop into pleasant dreams; or musing <mark3>lie,</mark3><br>
Mark the wind-shaken <mark3>trees,</mark3><br>
And cloud-betravelled <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
<br>
There think me how some barter joy for <mark5>care,</mark5><br>
And waste life's summer-health in riot <mark1>rude,</mark1><br>
Of nature, nor of nature's sweets <mark3>aware.</mark3><br>
When passions vain <mark1>intrude,</mark1><br>
These, by calm musings, softened are and <mark4>still;</mark4><br>
And the heart's better <mark3>mood</mark3><br>
Feels sick of doing <mark3>ill.</mark3><br>
<br>
There I can live, and at my leisure <mark3>seek</mark3><br>
Joys far from cold restraints?not fearing <mark4>pride?</mark4><br>
Free as the winds, that breathe upon my <mark3>cheek</mark3><br>
Rude health, so long <mark3>denied.</mark3><br>
Here poor Integrity can sit at <mark1>ease,</mark1><br>
And list <mark4>self-satisfied</mark4><br>
The song of <mark4>honey-bees.</mark4><br>
<br>
The green lane now I traverse, where it <mark1>goes</mark1><br>
      Nought guessing, till some sudden turn espies<br>
Rude batter'd finger post, that stooping <mark1>shows</mark1><br>
Where the snug mystery <mark4>lies;</mark4><br>
And then a mossy spire, with ivy <mark4>crown,</mark4><br>
Cheers up the short <mark3>surprise,</mark3><br>
And shows a peeping <mark3>town.</mark3><br>
<br>
I see the wild flowers, in their summer <mark4>morn</mark4><br>
Of beauty, feeding on joy's luscious <mark4>hours;</mark4><br>
The gay convolvulus, wreathing round the <mark3>thorn,</mark3><br>
Agape for honey <mark3>showers;</mark3><br>
And slender kingcup, burnished with the <mark3>dew</mark3><br>
Of morning's early <mark1>hours,</mark1><br>
Like gold yminted <mark3>new.</mark3><br>
<br>
And mark by rustic bridge, o'er shallow <mark5>stream,</mark5><br>
Cow-tending boy, to toil <mark4>unreconciled,</mark4><br>
Absorbed as in some vagrant summer <mark3>dream;</mark3><br>
Who now, in gestures <mark4>wild,</mark4><br>
Starts dancing to his shadow on the <mark4>wall,</mark4><br>
Feeling <mark4>self-gratified,</mark4><br>
Nor fearing human <mark3>thrall.</mark3><br>
<br>
Or thread the sunny valley laced with <mark4>streams,</mark4><br>
      Or forests rude, and the o'ershadow'd brims<br>
Of simple <mark4>ponds</mark4>, where idle shepherd <mark3>dreams,</mark3><br>
Stretching his listless <mark4>limbs;</mark4><br>
Or trace hay-scented meadows, smooth and <mark4>long,</mark4><br>
Where joy's wild impulse <mark3>swims</mark3><br>
In one continued <mark3>song.</mark3><br>
<br>
I love at early morn, from new mown <mark4>swath,</mark4><br>
To see the startled frog his route <mark3>pursue;</mark3><br>
To mark while, leaping o'er the dripping <mark4>path,</mark4><br>
His bright sides scatter <mark1>dew,</mark1><br>
The early lark that from its bustle <mark4>flies,</mark4><br>
To hail his matin <mark1>new;</mark1><br>
And watch him to the <mark3>skies.</mark3><br>
<br>
   To note on hedgerow baulks, in moisture sprent,<br>
The jetty snail creep from the mossy <mark1>thorn,</mark1><br>
With earnest heed, and tremulous <mark4>intent,</mark4><br>
Frail brother of the <mark1>morn,</mark1><br>
That from the tiny bent's dew-misted <mark4>leaves</mark4><br>
Withdraws his timid <mark1>horn,</mark1><br>
And fearful vision <mark3>weaves.</mark3><br>
<br>
Or swallow heed on smoke-tanned chimney <mark4>top,</mark4><br>
Wont to be first unsealing Morning's <mark3>eye,</mark3><br>
Ere yet the bee hath gleaned one wayward <mark3>drop</mark3><br>
Of honey on his <mark3>thigh;</mark3><br>
To see him seek morn's airy couch to <mark4>sing,</mark4><br>
Until the golden <mark1>sky</mark1><br>
Bepaint his russet <mark1>wing.</mark1><br>
<br>
Or sauntering boy by tanning corn to <mark3>spy,</mark3><br>
With clapping noise to startle birds <mark5>away,</mark5><br>
And hear him bawl to every passer <mark3>by</mark3><br>
To know the hour of <mark3>day;</mark3><br>
While the uncradled breezes, fresh and <mark4>strong,</mark4><br>
With waking blossoms <mark3>play,</mark3><br>
And breathe AEolian <mark1>song.</mark1><br>
<br>
I love the south-west <mark4>wind</mark4>, or low or <mark4>loud,</mark4><br>
And not the less when sudden drops of <mark4>rain</mark4><br>
Moisten my glowing cheek from ebon <mark3>cloud,</mark3><br>
Threatening soft showers <mark3>again,</mark3><br>
That over lands new ploughed and meadow <mark4>grounds,</mark4><br>
      Summer's sweet breath unchain,<br>
And wake harmonious <mark3>sounds.</mark3><br>
<br>
Rich music breathes in Summer's every <mark4>sound;</mark4><br>
And in her harmony of varied <mark4>greens,</mark4><br>
Woods, meadows, hedge-rows, corn-fields, all <mark3>around</mark3><br>
Much beauty <mark3>intervenes,</mark3><br>
Filling with harmony the ear and <mark1>eye;</mark1><br>
While o'er the mingling <mark3>scenes</mark3><br>
Far spreads the laughing <mark1>sky.</mark1><br>
<br>
See, how the wind-enamoured aspen <mark1>leaves</mark1><br>
Turn up their silver lining to the <mark4>sun!</mark4><br>
And hark! the rustling noise, that oft deceives,<br>
And makes the sheep-boy <mark3>run:</mark3><br>
The sound so mimics fast-approaching <mark1>showers,</mark1><br>
He thinks the rain's <mark3>begun,</mark3><br>
And hastes to sheltering <mark3>bowers.</mark3><br>
<br>
But now the evening curdles dank and <mark3>grey,</mark3><br>
Changing her watchet hue for sombre <mark4>weed;</mark4><br>
And moping owls, to close the lids of <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
On drowsy wing <mark3>proceed;</mark3><br>
While chickering crickets, tremulous and <mark1>long,</mark1><br>
Light's farewell inly <mark3>heed,</mark3><br>
And give it parting <mark1>song.</mark1><br>
<br>
The pranking bat its flighty circlet <mark4>makes;</mark4><br>
The glow-worm burnishes its lamp <mark3>anew;</mark3><br>
O'er meadows dew-besprent, the beetle <mark3>wakes</mark3><br>
Inquiries ever <mark1>new,</mark1><br>
Teazing each passing ear with murmurs <mark4>vain,</mark4><br>
As wanting to <mark1>pursue</mark1><br>
His homeward path <mark1>again.</mark1><br>
<br>
Hark! 'tis the melody of distant <mark4>bells</mark4><br>
That on the wind with pleasing hum <mark4>rebounds</mark4><br>
By fitful starts, then musically <mark4>swells</mark4><br>
O'er the dim stilly <mark1>grounds;</mark1><br>
While on the meadow-bridge the pausing <mark3>boy</mark3><br>
Listens the mellow <mark1>sounds,</mark1><br>
And hums in vacant <mark3>joy.</mark3><br>
<br>
Now <mark3>homeward-bound</mark3>, the hedger bundles <mark4>round</mark4><br>
His evening faggot, and with every <mark4>stride</mark4><br>
His leathern doublet leaves a rustling <mark1>sound,</mark1><br>
Till silly sheep <mark4>beside</mark4><br>
His path start tremulous, and once <mark1>again</mark1><br>
Look back <mark4>dissatisfied,</mark4><br>
And scour the dewy <mark3>plain.</mark3><br>
<br>
How sweet the soothing calmness that <mark4>distills</mark4><br>
O'er the heart's every sense its opiate <mark4>dews,</mark4><br>
In meek-eyed moods and ever balmy trills!<br>
      That softens and subdues,<br>
With gentle Quiet's bland and sober <mark3>train,</mark3><br>
Which dreamy eve <mark3>renews</mark3><br>
In many a mellow <mark3>strain!</mark3><br>
<br>
I love to walk the fields, they are to <mark3>me</mark3><br>
A legacy no evil can <mark3>destroy;</mark3><br>
They, like a spell, set every rapture <mark1>free</mark1><br>
That cheer'd me when a <mark1>boy.</mark1><br>
Play?pastime?all Time's blotting pen <mark4>conceal'd,</mark4><br>
Comes like a new-born <mark1>joy,</mark1><br>
To greet me in the <mark4>field.</mark4><br>
<br>
For Nature's objects ever <mark4>harmonize</mark4><br>
With emulous Taste, that vulgar deed <mark4>annoys;</mark4><br>
Which loves in pensive moods to <mark4>sympathize,</mark4><br>
And meet vibrating <mark4>joys</mark4><br>
O'er Nature's pleasing things; nor slighting, <mark4>deems</mark4><br>
<mark4>Pastimes</mark4>, the Muse <mark4>employs,</mark4><br>
Vain and obtrusive <mark4>themes.</mark4><br>
