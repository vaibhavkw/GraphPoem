Title : A Serious and Pathetical Contemplation of the Mercies of God <br>
Author : Thomas Traherne <br><br>

For all the mysteries, engines, instruments, wherewith the world is filled, which we are able to frame and use to thy <mark4>glory.</mark4><br>
For all the trades, variety of operations, cities, temples, streets, bridges, mariner's compass, admirable picture, sculpture, writing, printing, songs and music; wherewith the world is beautified and <mark4>adorned.</mark4><br>
       Much more for the regent life,<br>
And power of <mark4>perception,</mark4><br>
Which rules <mark4>within.</mark4><br>
That secret depth of fathomless <mark4>consideration</mark4><br>
That receives the <mark3>information</mark3><br>
Of all our <mark4>senses,</mark4><br>
That makes our centre equal to the <mark4>heavens,</mark4><br>
And comprehendeth in itself the magnitude of the <mark4>world;</mark4><br>
The involv'd <mark4>mysteries</mark4><br>
Of our common <mark5>sense;</mark5><br>
The inaccessible <mark4>secret</mark4><br>
Of perceptive <mark4>fancy;</mark4><br>
The repository and <mark4>treasury</mark4><br>
Of things that are <mark4>past;</mark4><br>
                      The presentation of things to come;<br>
Thy name be <mark4>glorified</mark4><br>
For <mark4>evermore.</mark4><br>
<br>
O <mark4>miracle</mark4><br>
Of divine <mark4>goodness!</mark4><br>
                      O fire! O flame of zeal, and love, and joy!<br>
Ev'n for our earthly <mark4>bodies</mark4>, hast thou created all <mark4>things.</mark4><br>
{ <mark4>visible</mark4><br>
All things    { <mark4>material</mark4><br>
{ <mark4>sensible</mark4><br>
<br>
Bodies <mark4>celestial,</mark4><br>
<br>
Bodies <mark4>terrestrial,</mark4><br>
The four <mark4>elements,</mark4><br>
Volatile <mark4>spirits,</mark4><br>
Trees, <mark4>herbs</mark4>, and <mark4>flowers,</mark4><br>
The influences of <mark4>heaven,</mark4><br>
Clouds, vapors, <mark4>wind,</mark4><br>
               Dew, rain, hail and snow,<br>
       Light and darkness, night and day,<br>
The seasons of the <mark4>year.</mark4><br>
Springs, rivers, <mark4>fountains</mark4>, <mark4>oceans,</mark4><br>
Gold, silver, and precious <mark4>stones.</mark4><br>
Corn, wine, and <mark4>oil,</mark4><br>
The sun, moon, and <mark4>stars,</mark4><br>
Cities, <mark4>nations</mark4>, <mark4>kingdoms.</mark4><br>
And the bodies of men, the greatest treasures of <mark4>all,</mark4><br>
For each <mark4>other.</mark4><br>
What then, O Lord, hast thou intended for <mark4>our</mark4><br>
<mark4>Souls</mark4>, who givest to our bodies such glorious <mark1>things!</mark1><br>
