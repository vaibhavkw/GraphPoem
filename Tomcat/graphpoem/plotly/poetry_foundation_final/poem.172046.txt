Title : A Pastoral <br>
Author : Agha Shahid Ali <br><br>

on the wall the dense ivy of executions --ZBIGNIEW <mark4>HERBERT</mark4><br>
We shall meet again, in <mark4>Srinagar,</mark4><br>
by the gates of the Villa of <mark4>Peace,</mark4><br>
our hands blossoming into <mark4>fists</mark4><br>
till the soldiers return the <mark4>keys</mark4><br>
and disappear. Again we'll <mark5>enter</mark5><br>
our last world, the first that <mark4>vanished</mark4><br>
<br>
in our absence from the broken <mark4>city.</mark4><br>
We'll tear our shirts for tourniquets <br>
and bind the open thorns, warm the <mark4>ivy</mark4><br>
into roses. Quick, by the <mark4>pomegranate--</mark4><br>
the bird will say--Humankind can <mark4>bear</mark4><br>
everything. No need to stop the <mark4>ear</mark4><br>
<br>
to stories rumored in branches: We'll <mark3>hear</mark3><br>
our gardener's voice, the way we <mark4>did</mark4><br>
as children, clear under trees he'd <mark4>planted:</mark4><br>
"It's true, my death, at the mosque <mark4>entrance,</mark4><br>
in the <mark4>massacre</mark4>, when the Call to <mark4>Prayer</mark4><br>
opened the floodgates"--Quick, follow the <mark4>silence--</mark4><br>
<br>
"and dawn rushed into everyone's <mark4>eyes."</mark4><br>
Will we follow the horned lark, <mark3>pry</mark3><br>
open the back gate into the poplar <mark4>groves,</mark4><br>
go past the search post into the <mark4>cemetery,</mark4><br>
the dust still uneasy on hurried <mark4>graves</mark4><br>
with no names, like all new ones in the <mark1>city?</mark1><br>
<br>
"It's true" (we'll hear our <mark4>gardener</mark4><br>
again). "That bird is silent all <mark4>winter.</mark4><br>
Its voice returns in spring, a plaintive <mark3>cry.</mark3><br>
That's when it saw the mountain <mark4>falcon</mark4><br>
rip open, in mid-air, the blue magpie,   <br>
then carry it, limp from the <mark4>talons."</mark4><br>
<br>
Pluck the blood: My words will echo <mark4>thus</mark4><br>
at sunset, by the ivy, but to what <mark4>purpose?</mark4><br>
In the drawer of the cedar <mark4>stand,</mark4><br>
white in the verandah, we'll find <mark4>letters:</mark4><br>
When the post offices died, the <mark4>mailman</mark4><br>
knew we'd return to answer them. <mark4>Better</mark4><br>
<br>
if he'd let them speed to <mark3>death,</mark3><br>
blacked out by Autumn's Press <mark4>Trust</mark4><br>
not like this, taking away our <mark3>breath,</mark3><br>
holding it with love's <mark4>anonymous</mark4><br>
scripts: "See how your world has <mark4>cracked.</mark4><br>
Why aren't you here? Where are you? Come back. <br>
<br>
Is history deaf there, across the <mark4>oceans?"</mark4><br>
Quick, the bird will say. And we'll <mark3>try</mark3><br>
the keys, with the first one open the <mark4>door</mark4><br>
into the drawing room. Mirror after <mark4>mirror,</mark4><br>
textiled by dust, will blind us to our <mark4>return</mark4><br>
as we light oil lamps. The glass map of our <mark4>country,</mark4><br>
<br>
still on the wall, will tear us to <mark4>lace--</mark4><br>
We'll go past our ancestors, up the <mark4>staircase,</mark4><br>
holding their wills against our hearts. Their wish <br>
was we return--forever!--and inherit(Quick, the <mark4>bird</mark4><br>
will say) that to which we belong, not like <mark4>this--</mark4><br>
to get news of our death after the <mark4>world's.</mark4><br>
