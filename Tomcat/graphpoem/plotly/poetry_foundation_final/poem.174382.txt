Title : Art thou pale for weariness <br>
Author : Percy Bysshe Shelley <br><br>

         Art thou pale for weariness<br>
Of climbing heaven and gazing on the <mark3>earth,</mark3><br>
         Wandering companionless<br>
Among the stars that have a different <mark3>birth,</mark3><br>
And ever changing, like a joyless eye<br>
That finds no object worth its constancy?<br>
