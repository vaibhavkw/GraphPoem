Title : A Birthday <br>
Author : Christina Rossetti <br><br>

My heart is like a singing bird <br>
Whose nest is in a water'd <mark3>shoot;</mark3><br>
My heart is like an <mark3>apple-tree</mark3><br>
Whose boughs are bent with thickset <mark3>fruit;</mark3><br>
My heart is like a rainbow shell <br>
That paddles in a halcyon <mark3>sea;</mark3><br>
My heart is gladder than all <mark4>these</mark4><br>
Because my love is come to <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
<br>
Raise me a dais of silk and down; <br>
Hang it with vair and purple <mark4>dyes;</mark4><br>
Carve it in doves and pomegranates, <br>
And peacocks with a hundred <mark3>eyes;</mark3><br>
Work it in gold and silver grapes, <br>
In leaves and silver <mark3>fleurs-de-lys;</mark3><br>
Because the birthday of my life <br>
Is come, my love is come to <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
