Title : A Psalm of Life <br>
Author : Henry Wadsworth Longfellow <br><br>

What The Heart Of The Young Man Said To The Psalmist.<br>
Tell me not, in mournful <mark4>numbers,</mark4><br>
Life is but an empty <mark3>dream!</mark3><br>
For the soul is dead that slumbers, <br>
And things are not what they <mark3>seem.</mark3><br>
<br>
Life is real! Life is <mark4>earnest!</mark4><br>
And the grave is not its <mark3>goal;</mark3><br>
Dust thou art, to dust returnest, <br>
Was not spoken of the <mark3>soul.</mark3><br>
<br>
Not enjoyment, and not sorrow, <br>
Is our destined end or <mark3>way;</mark3><br>
But to act, that each <mark5>to-morrow</mark5><br>
Find us farther than <mark3>to-day.</mark3><br>
<br>
Art is <mark4>long</mark4>, and Time is <mark4>fleeting,</mark4><br>
And our hearts, though stout and <mark3>brave,</mark3><br>
Still, like muffled drums, are <mark3>beating</mark3><br>
Funeral marches to the <mark3>grave.</mark3><br>
<br>
In the world's broad field of <mark4>battle,</mark4><br>
In the bivouac of <mark3>Life,</mark3><br>
Be not like dumb, driven <mark3>cattle!</mark3><br>
Be a hero in the <mark3>strife!</mark3><br>
<br>
Trust no Future, howe'er <mark4>pleasant!</mark4><br>
   Let the dead Past bury its dead! <br>
<mark4>Act,-</mark4>, act in the living <mark3>Present!</mark3><br>
Heart within, and God <mark4>o'erhead!</mark4><br>
<br>
Lives of great men all remind <mark1>us</mark1><br>
We can make our lives <mark4>sublime,</mark4><br>
And, departing, leave behind <mark1>us</mark1><br>
Footprints on the sands of <mark3>time;</mark3><br>
<br>
Footprints, that perhaps <mark3>another,</mark3><br>
Sailing o'er life's solemn <mark3>main,</mark3><br>
A forlorn and shipwrecked <mark3>brother,</mark3><br>
Seeing, shall take heart <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
<br>
Let us, then, be up and <mark4>doing,</mark4><br>
With a heart for any <mark4>fate;</mark4><br>
Still <mark4>achieving</mark4>, still <mark3>pursuing,</mark3><br>
Learn to labor and to <mark3>wait.</mark3><br>
