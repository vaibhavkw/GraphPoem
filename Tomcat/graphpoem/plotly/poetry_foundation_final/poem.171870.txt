Title : Bread <br>
Author : W. S. Merwin <br><br>

for Wendell Berry<br>
Each face in the street is a slice of <mark1>bread</mark1><br>
wandering <mark4>on</mark4><br>
<br>
somewhere in the light the true hunger   <br>
appears to be passing them by   <br>
they clutch <br>
have they forgotten the pale <mark1>caves</mark1><br>
<br>
they dreamed of hiding <mark4>in</mark4><br>
their own <mark1>caves</mark1><br>
full of the waiting of their footprints <br>
hung with the hollow marks of their <mark4>groping</mark4><br>
full of their sleep and their <mark4>hiding</mark4><br>
have they forgotten the ragged <mark4>tunnels</mark4><br>
<br>
they dreamed of following in out of the light   <br>
to hear step after step <br>
the heart of <mark1>bread</mark1><br>
<br>
to be sustained by its dark <mark5>breath</mark5><br>
and emerge <br>
to find themselves <mark4>alone</mark4><br>
<br>
before a wheat <mark4>field</mark4><br>
raising its radiance to the <mark4>moon</mark4><br>
