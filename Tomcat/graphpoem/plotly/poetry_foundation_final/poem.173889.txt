Title : Aftermath <br>
Author : Henry Wadsworth Longfellow <br><br>

When the summer fields are <mark5>mown,</mark5><br>
When the birds are fledged and <mark5>flown,</mark5><br>
And the dry leaves strew the <mark4>path;</mark4><br>
With the falling of the <mark3>snow,</mark3><br>
With the cawing of the <mark3>crow,</mark3><br>
Once again the fields we <mark3>mow</mark3><br>
And gather in the <mark4>aftermath.</mark4><br>
<br>
Not the sweet, new grass with <mark5>flowers</mark5><br>
Is this harvesting of <mark3>ours;</mark3><br>
Not the upland clover <mark3>bloom;</mark3><br>
But the rowen mixed with <mark4>weeds,</mark4><br>
Tangled tufts from marsh and <mark3>meads,</mark3><br>
Where the poppy drops its <mark3>seeds</mark3><br>
In the silence and the <mark3>gloom.</mark3><br>
