Title : Unholy Sonnet 11 <br>
Author : Mark Jarman <br><br>

Half asleep in prayer I said the right <mark4>thing</mark4><br>
And felt a sudden pleasure come <mark3>into</mark3><br>
The room or my own body. In the dark,   <br>
Charged with a change of atmosphere, at <mark4>first</mark4><br>
I couldn't tell my body from the room.   <br>
And I was wide awake, full of this <mark4>feeling,</mark4><br>
Alert as though I'd heard a doorknob <mark4>twist,</mark4><br>
A drawer pulled, and instead of terror <mark3>knew</mark3><br>
The intrusion of an overwhelming joy.   <br>
I had said thanks and this was the response.   <br>
But how I said it or what I said it for   <br>
I still cannot recall and I have <mark4>tried</mark4><br>
All sorts of ways all hours of the <mark4>night.</mark4><br>
Once was enough to be <mark4>dissatisfied.</mark4><br>
