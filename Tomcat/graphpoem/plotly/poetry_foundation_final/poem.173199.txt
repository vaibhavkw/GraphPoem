Title : To the Ladies <br>
Author : Lady Mary Chudleigh <br><br>

Wife and servant are the <mark3>same,</mark3><br>
But only differ in the <mark3>name:</mark3><br>
For when that fatal knot is <mark3>tied,</mark3><br>
Which nothing, nothing can <mark3>divide:</mark3><br>
When she the word obey has <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
And man by law supreme has <mark4>made,</mark4><br>
Then all that's kind is laid <mark4>aside,</mark4><br>
And nothing left but state and <mark3>pride:</mark3><br>
Fierce as an Eastern prince he <mark3>grows,</mark3><br>
And all his innate rigour <mark3>shows:</mark3><br>
Then but to look, to laugh, or <mark4>speak,</mark4><br>
Will the nuptial contract <mark4>break.</mark4><br>
Like mutes she signs alone must <mark3>make,</mark3><br>
And never any freedom <mark3>take:</mark3><br>
But still be governed by a <mark4>nod,</mark4><br>
And fear her husband as a <mark3>God:</mark3><br>
Him still must serve, him still <mark3>obey,</mark3><br>
And nothing act, and nothing <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
But what her haughty lord thinks <mark3>fit,</mark3><br>
Who with the power, has all the <mark3>wit.</mark3><br>
Then shun, oh! shun that wretched <mark4>state,</mark4><br>
And all the fawning flatt'rers <mark3>hate:</mark3><br>
Value your <mark4>selves</mark4>, and men <mark4>despise,</mark4><br>
You must be proud, if you'll be <mark3>wise.</mark3><br>
