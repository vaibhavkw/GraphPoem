Title : The Calm <br>
Author : John Donne <br><br>

Our storm is past, and that storm's tyrannous rage, <br>
A stupid calm, but nothing it, doth 'suage. <br>
The fable is inverted, and far <mark3>more</mark3><br>
A block afflicts, now, than a stork <mark3>before.</mark3><br>
Storms chafe, and soon wear out themselves, or <mark3>us;</mark3><br>
In calms, Heaven laughs to see us languish <mark3>thus.</mark3><br>
As steady'as I can wish that my thoughts were, <br>
Smooth as thy mistress' glass, or what shines <mark4>there,</mark4><br>
The sea is now; and, as the isles which <mark3>we</mark3><br>
Seek, when we can move, our ships rooted <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
As water did in storms, now pitch runs <mark3>out;</mark3><br>
As lead, when a fir'd church becomes one <mark3>spout.</mark3><br>
And all our beauty, and our trim, <mark3>decays,</mark3><br>
Like courts removing, or like ended <mark3>plays.</mark3><br>
The fighting-place now seamen's rags <mark3>supply;</mark3><br>
And all the tackling is a frippery. <br>
No use of lanthorns; and in one place <mark1>lay</mark1><br>
Feathers and dust, to-day and <mark4>yesterday.</mark4><br>
Earth's hollownesses, which the world's lungs <mark4>are,</mark4><br>
Have no more wind than the upper vault of <mark4>air.</mark4><br>
We can nor lost friends nor sought foes <mark3>recover,</mark3><br>
But meteor-like, save that we move not, <mark3>hover.</mark3><br>
Only the calenture together <mark4>draws</mark4><br>
Dear <mark4>friends</mark4>, which meet dead in great fishes' <mark3>jaws;</mark3><br>
And on the hatches, as on <mark4>altars</mark4>, <mark4>lies</mark4><br>
Each one, his own priest, and own <mark4>sacrifice.</mark4><br>
Who live, that miracle do multiply, <br>
Where walkers in hot ovens do not <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
If in despite of these we swim, that <mark3>hath</mark3><br>
No more refreshing than our brimstone <mark3>bath;</mark3><br>
But from the sea into the ship we <mark3>turn,</mark3><br>
Like parboil'd wretches, on the coals to <mark3>burn.</mark3><br>
Like Bajazet encag'd, the shepherds' <mark3>scoff,</mark3><br>
Or like slack-sinew'd Samson, his hair <mark3>off,</mark3><br>
Languish our ships. Now as a <mark4>myriad</mark4><br>
Of ants durst th' emperor's lov'd snake <mark4>invade,</mark4><br>
The crawling gallies, sea-gaols, finny <mark4>chips,</mark4><br>
Might brave our pinnaces, now bed-rid <mark3>ships.</mark3><br>
Whether a rotten state, and hope of <mark4>gain,</mark4><br>
Or to disuse me from the queasy <mark3>pain</mark3><br>
Of being belov'd and loving, or the <mark4>thirst</mark4><br>
Of honour, or fair death, out-push'd me <mark3>first,</mark3><br>
I lose my end; for here, as well as <mark3>I,</mark3><br>
A desperate may live, and a coward <mark1>die.</mark1><br>
Stag, dog, and all which from or towards <mark3>flies,</mark3><br>
Is paid with life or prey, or doing <mark3>dies.</mark3><br>
Fate grudges us all, and doth subtly <mark1>lay</mark1><br>
A scourge, 'gainst which we all forget to <mark3>pray.</mark3><br>
He that at sea prays for more wind, as <mark3>well</mark3><br>
Under the poles may beg cold, heat in <mark3>hell.</mark3><br>
What are we then? How little more, <mark4>alas,</mark4><br>
Is man now, than before he was? He <mark4>was</mark4><br>
Nothing; for us, we are for nothing <mark4>fit;</mark4><br>
Chance, or ourselves, still disproportion <mark3>it.</mark3><br>
We have no power, no will, no sense; I <mark3>lie,</mark3><br>
I should not then thus feel this <mark4>misery.</mark4><br>
