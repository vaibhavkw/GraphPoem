Title : Old Couple <br>
Author : Charles Simic <br><br>

They're waiting to be <mark4>murdered,</mark4><br>
Or evicted. Soon <br>
They expect to have nothing to <mark4>eat.</mark4><br>
In the meantime, they <mark4>sit.</mark4><br>
<br>
A violent pain is coming, they <mark4>think.</mark4><br>
It will start in the <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
And climb into the mouth. <br>
They'll be carried off in stretchers, howling. <br>
<br>
Tonight they watch the window   <br>
Without exchanging a <mark4>word.</mark4><br>
It has rained, and now it <mark4>looks</mark4><br>
Like it's going to snow a little. <br>
<br>
I see him get up to lower the <mark4>shades.</mark4><br>
If their window stays <mark4>dark,</mark4><br>
I know his hand has reached <mark4>hers</mark4><br>
Just as she was about to turn on the <mark4>lights.</mark4><br>
