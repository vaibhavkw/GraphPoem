Title : Paradise Lost: Book 8 (1674 version) <br>
Author : John Milton <br><br>

THE Angel ended, and in Adams <mark5>Eare</mark5><br>
So Charming left his voice, that he a <mark4>while</mark4><br>
Thought him still speaking, still stood fixt to <mark5>hear;</mark5><br>
Then as new wak't thus gratefully <mark1>repli'd.</mark1><br>
What thanks sufficient, or what <mark5>recompence</mark5><br>
Equal have I to render thee, <mark4>Divine</mark4><br>
Hystorian, who thus largely hast <mark5>allayd</mark5><br>
The thirst I had of knowledge, and <mark1>voutsaf't</mark1><br>
This friendly condescention to <mark4>relate</mark4><br>
Things else by me unsearchable, now <mark5>heard</mark5><br>
With wonder, but delight, and, as is <mark3>due,</mark3><br>
With glorie attributed to the <mark3>high</mark3><br>
Creator; something yet of doubt <mark5>remaines,</mark5><br>
Which onely thy solution can <mark4>resolve.</mark4><br>
When I behold this goodly Frame, this <mark4>World</mark4><br>
Of Heav'n and Earth consisting, and <mark4>compute,</mark4><br>
Thir magnitudes, this Earth a spot, a <mark5>graine,</mark5><br>
An Atom, with the Firmament <mark5>compar'd</mark5><br>
And all her numberd Starrs, that seem to rowle <br>
Spaces incomprehensible (for <mark4>such</mark4><br>
Thir distance argues and thir swift <mark4>return</mark4><br>
Diurnal) meerly to officiate <mark4>light</mark4><br>
Round this opacous Earth, this punctual <mark4>spot,</mark4><br>
One day and night; in all thir vast <mark3>survey</mark3><br>
Useless besides, reasoning I oft <mark4>admire,</mark4><br>
How Nature wise and frugal could <mark4>commit</mark4><br>
Such disproportions, with superfluous <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
So many nobler Bodies to <mark4>create,</mark4><br>
Greater so manifold to this one <mark4>use,</mark4><br>
For aught appeers, and on thir Orbs <mark4>impose</mark4><br>
Such restless revolution day by <mark3>day</mark3><br>
Repeated, while the sedentarie <mark5>Earth,</mark5><br>
That better might with farr less compass <mark4>move,</mark4><br>
Serv'd by more noble then her self, <mark5>attaines</mark5><br>
Her end without least motion, and <mark5>receaves,</mark5><br>
As Tribute such a sumless journey <mark4>brought</mark4><br>
Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and <mark1>light;</mark1><br>
Speed, to describe whose swiftness Number <mark5>failes.</mark5><br>
<br>
So spake our Sire, and by his count'nance <mark5>seemd</mark5><br>
Entring on studious thoughts abstruse, which <mark4>Eve</mark4><br>
Perceaving where she sat retir'd in <mark3>sight,</mark3><br>
With lowliness Majestic from her <mark4>seat,</mark4><br>
And Grace that won who saw to wish her <mark3>stay,</mark3><br>
<mark4>Rose</mark4>, and went forth among her Fruits and <mark4>Flours,</mark4><br>
To visit how they prosper'd, bud and <mark4>bloom,</mark4><br>
Her Nurserie; they at her coming <mark4>sprung</mark4><br>
And toucht by her fair tendance gladlier <mark3>grew.</mark3><br>
Yet went she not, as not with such <mark4>discourse</mark4><br>
Delighted, or not capable her <mark1>eare</mark1><br>
Of what was high: such pleasure she <mark5>reserv'd,</mark5><br>
Adam relating, she sole Auditress; <br>
Her Husband the Relater she <mark5>preferr'd</mark5><br>
Before the Angel, and of him to <mark4>ask</mark4><br>
Chose rather; hee, she knew would <mark4>intermix</mark4><br>
Grateful digressions, and solve high <mark4>dispute</mark4><br>
With conjugal Caresses, from his <mark4>Lip</mark4><br>
Not Words alone pleas'd her.   O when meet <mark3>now</mark3><br>
Such pairs, in Love and mutual Honour joyn'd? <br>
With Goddess-like demeanour forth she <mark4>went;</mark4><br>
Not unattended, for on her as <mark4>Queen</mark4><br>
A pomp of winning Graces waited <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
And from about her shot Darts of <mark5>desire</mark5><br>
Into all Eyes to wish her still in <mark1>sight.</mark1><br>
And Raphael now to Adam's doubt <mark5>propos'd</mark5><br>
Benevolent and facil thus <mark1>repli'd.</mark1><br>
<br>
To ask or search I blame thee not, for <mark5>Heav'n</mark5><br>
Is as the Book of God before thee <mark4>set,</mark4><br>
Wherein to read his wondrous Works, and <mark1>learne</mark1><br>
His Seasons, Hours, or Dayes, or Months, or Yeares: <br>
This to attain, whether Heav'n move or <mark1>Earth,</mark1><br>
Imports not, if thou reck'n <mark4>right</mark4>, the <mark4>rest</mark4><br>
From Man or Angel the great <mark4>Architect</mark4><br>
Did wisely to conceal, and not <mark4>divulge</mark4><br>
His secrets to be scann'd by them who <mark4>ought</mark4><br>
Rather admire; or if they list to <mark3>try</mark3><br>
Conjecture, he his Fabric of the <mark5>Heav'ns</mark5><br>
Hath left to thir disputes, perhaps to <mark1>move</mark1><br>
His laughter at thir quaint Opinions <mark4>wide</mark4><br>
Hereafter, when they come to model <mark1>Heav'n</mark1><br>
And calculate the Starrs, how they will <mark4>weild</mark4><br>
The mightie frame, how build, unbuild, <mark4>contrive</mark4><br>
To save appeerances, how gird the Sphear <br>
With Centric and Eccentric scribl'd <mark4>o're,</mark4><br>
Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in <mark4>Orb:</mark4><br>
Alreadie by thy reasoning this I <mark4>guess,</mark4><br>
Who art to lead thy ofspring, and <mark5>supposest</mark5><br>
That bodies bright and greater should not <mark4>serve</mark4><br>
The less not bright, nor Heav'n such journies <mark4>run,</mark4><br>
Earth sitting still, when she alone <mark1>receaves</mark1><br>
The benefit: consider <mark4>first</mark4>, that <mark4>Great</mark4><br>
Or Bright inferrs not Excellence: the <mark1>Earth</mark1><br>
Though, in comparison of Heav'n, so <mark4>small,</mark4><br>
Nor glistering, may of solid good <mark5>containe</mark5><br>
More plenty then the Sun that barren <mark4>shines</mark4><br>
Whose vertue on it self workes no <mark4>effect,</mark4><br>
But in the fruitful Earth; there first <mark5>receavd</mark5><br>
His beams, unactive else, thir vigour <mark4>find.</mark4><br>
Yet not to Earth are those bright <mark4>Luminaries</mark4><br>
Officious, but to thee Earths habitant. <br>
And for the Heav'ns wide Circuit, let it <mark4>speak</mark4><br>
The Makers high magnificence, who <mark4>built</mark4><br>
So spacious, and his Line stretcht out so <mark4>farr;</mark4><br>
That Man may know he dwells not in his <mark4>own;</mark4><br>
An Edifice too large for him to <mark4>fill,</mark4><br>
Lodg'd in a small partition, and the <mark1>rest</mark1><br>
Ordain'd for uses to his Lord best <mark3>known.</mark3><br>
The swiftness of those Circles <mark4>attribute</mark4><br>
Though numberless, to his <mark4>Omnipotence,</mark4><br>
That to corporeal substances could adde <br>
Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not <mark3>slow,</mark3><br>
Who since the Morning hour set out from <mark1>Heav'n</mark1><br>
Where God resides, and ere mid-day arriv'd <br>
In Eden, distance inexpressible <br>
By Numbers that have name.   But this I <mark4>urge,</mark4><br>
Admitting Motion in the Heav'ns, to <mark3>shew</mark3><br>
Invalid that which thee to doubt it <mark5>mov'd;</mark5><br>
Not that I so <mark4>affirm</mark4>, though so it <mark4>seem</mark4><br>
To thee who hast thy dwelling here on <mark1>Earth.</mark1><br>
God to remove his wayes from human <mark4>sense,</mark4><br>
Plac'd Heav'n from Earth so farr, that earthly <mark1>sight,</mark1><br>
If it presume, might erre in things too <mark1>high,</mark1><br>
And no advantage gaine.   What if the <mark4>Sun</mark4><br>
Be Center to the World, and other <mark4>Starrs</mark4><br>
By his attractive vertue and thir <mark1>own</mark1><br>
Incited, dance about him various <mark4>rounds?</mark4><br>
Thir wandring course now high, now low, then <mark4>hid,</mark4><br>
Progressive, retrograde, or standing <mark1>still,</mark1><br>
In six thou seest, and what if sev'nth to <mark4>these</mark4><br>
The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she <mark1>seem,</mark1><br>
Insensibly three different Motions <mark1>move?</mark1><br>
Which else to several Sphears thou must <mark4>ascribe,</mark4><br>
Mov'd contrarie with thwart obliquities, <br>
Or save the Sun his labour, and that <mark4>swift</mark4><br>
Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb <mark5>suppos'd,</mark5><br>
Invisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele <br>
Of Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe, <br>
If Earth industrious of her self fetch <mark1>Day</mark1><br>
Travelling East, and with her part <mark4>averse</mark4><br>
From the Suns beam meet <mark4>Night</mark4>, her other <mark4>part</mark4><br>
Still luminous by his ray.   What if that <mark1>light</mark1><br>
Sent from her through the wide transpicuous <mark1>aire,</mark1><br>
To the terrestrial Moon be as a <mark3>Starr</mark3><br>
Enlightning her by Day, as she by <mark3>Night</mark3><br>
This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be <mark4>there,</mark4><br>
Feilds and Inhabitants: Her spots thou <mark5>seest</mark5><br>
As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain <mark4>produce</mark4><br>
Fruits in her soft'nd Soile, for some to <mark1>eate</mark1><br>
Allotted there; and other Suns <mark4>perhaps</mark4><br>
With thir attendant Moons thou wilt <mark5>descrie</mark5><br>
Communicating Male and Femal <mark1>Light,</mark1><br>
Which two great Sexes animate the <mark1>World,</mark1><br>
Stor'd in each Orb perhaps with some that <mark4>live.</mark4><br>
For such vast room in Nature unpossest <br>
By living Soule, desert and <mark4>desolate,</mark4><br>
Onely to shine, yet scarce to <mark4>contribute</mark4><br>
Each Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so <mark1>farr</mark1><br>
Down to this habitable, which <mark5>returnes</mark5><br>
Light back to them, is obvious to <mark1>dispute.</mark1><br>
But whether thus these things, or whether <mark4>not,</mark4><br>
Whether the Sun predominant in <mark1>Heav'n</mark1><br>
Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the <mark1>Sun</mark1><br>
Hee from the East his flaming rode <mark4>begin,</mark4><br>
Or Shee from West her silent course <mark4>advance</mark4><br>
With inoffensive pace that spinning <mark4>sleeps</mark4><br>
On her soft Axle, while she paces Eev'n, <br>
And beares thee soft with the smooth Air <mark4>along,</mark4><br>
Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters <mark1>hid,</mark1><br>
Leave them to God above, him serve and <mark5>feare;</mark5><br>
Of other Creatures, as him pleases <mark4>best,</mark4><br>
Wherever plac't, let him dispose: joy <mark3>thou</mark3><br>
In what he gives to thee, this <mark4>Paradise</mark4><br>
And thy faire Eve; Heav'n is for thee too <mark1>high</mark1><br>
To know what passes there; be lowlie <mark4>wise:.</mark4><br>
Think onely what concernes thee and thy <mark4>being;</mark4><br>
Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures <mark1>there</mark1><br>
Live, in what state, condition or <mark3>degree,</mark3><br>
Contented that thus farr hath been <mark4>reveal'd</mark4><br>
Not of Earth onely but of highest <mark1>Heav'n.</mark1><br>
<br>
To whom thus Adam cleerd of doubt, <mark1>repli'd.</mark1><br>
How fully hast thou satisfi'd mee, <mark4>pure</mark4><br>
Intelligence of Heav'n, Angel <mark4>serene,</mark4><br>
And freed from intricacies, taught to <mark1>live,</mark1><br>
The easiest way, nor with perplexing <mark4>thoughts</mark4><br>
To interrupt the sweet of Life, from <mark4>which</mark4><br>
God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious <mark4>cares,</mark4><br>
And not molest us, unless we our <mark4>selves</mark4><br>
Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions <mark4>vain.</mark4><br>
But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave <br>
Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no <mark4>end;</mark4><br>
Till warn'd, or by experience taught, she <mark1>learne,</mark1><br>
That not to know at large of things <mark4>remote</mark4><br>
From use, obscure and suttle, but to <mark3>know</mark3><br>
That which before us lies in daily <mark1>life,</mark1><br>
Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is <mark4>fume,</mark4><br>
Or emptiness, or fond <mark5>impertinence,</mark5><br>
And renders us in things that most <mark5>concerne</mark5><br>
Unpractis'd, unprepar'd, and still to <mark3>seek.</mark3><br>
Therefore from this high pitch let us <mark3>descend</mark3><br>
A lower flight, and speak of things at <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
Useful, whence haply mention may <mark4>arise</mark4><br>
Of somthing not unseasonable to <mark1>ask</mark1><br>
By sufferance, and thy wonted favour <mark4>deign'd.</mark4><br>
Thee I have heard relating what was <mark4>don</mark4><br>
Ere my remembrance: now hear mee <mark1>relate</mark1><br>
My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not <mark1>heard;</mark1><br>
And Day is yet not spent; till then thou <mark1>seest</mark1><br>
How suttly to detaine thee I <mark4>devise,</mark4><br>
Inviting thee to hear while I <mark1>relate,</mark1><br>
Fond, were it not in hope of thy <mark3>reply:</mark3><br>
For while I sit with thee, I seem in <mark1>Heav'n,</mark1><br>
And sweeter thy discourse is to my <mark1>eare</mark1><br>
Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to <mark4>thirst</mark4><br>
And hunger both, from labour, at the <mark1>houre</mark1><br>
Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon <mark1>fill,</mark1><br>
Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace <mark1>Divine</mark1><br>
Imbu'd, bring to thir sweetness no satietie. <br>
To whom thus Raphael answer'd heav'nly <mark4>meek.</mark4><br>
<br>
Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of <mark4>men,</mark4><br>
Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on <mark3>thee</mark3><br>
Abundantly his gifts hath also <mark4>pour'd</mark4><br>
Inward and outward both, his image <mark4>faire:</mark4><br>
Speaking or mute all comliness and <mark4>grace</mark4><br>
Attends thee, and each word, each motion <mark5>formes,</mark5><br>
Nor less think wee in Heav'n of thee on <mark1>Earth</mark1><br>
Then of our fellow servant, and <mark4>inquire</mark4><br>
Gladly into the wayes of God with <mark4>Man:</mark4><br>
For God we see hath honour'd thee, and <mark1>set</mark1><br>
On Man his Equal Love: say therefore <mark4>on;</mark4><br>
For I that Day was absent, as <mark4>befell,</mark4><br>
Bound on a voyage uncouth and <mark4>obscure,</mark4><br>
Farr on excursion toward the Gates of <mark3>Hell;</mark3><br>
Squar'd in full Legion (such command we <mark4>had)</mark4><br>
To see that none thence issu'd forth a <mark3>spie,</mark3><br>
Or enemie, while God was in his <mark4>work,</mark4><br>
Least hee incenst at such eruption <mark4>bold,</mark4><br>
Destruction with Creation might have <mark5>mixt.</mark5><br>
Not that they durst without his leave <mark4>attempt,</mark4><br>
But us he sends upon his high <mark5>behests</mark5><br>
For state, as Sovran King, and to enure <br>
Our prompt obedience.   Fast we found, fast <mark4>shut</mark4><br>
The dismal Gates, and barricado'd <mark4>strong;</mark4><br>
But long ere our approaching heard <mark4>within</mark4><br>
Noise, other then the sound of Dance or <mark3>Song,</mark3><br>
Torment, and loud lament, and furious <mark4>rage.</mark4><br>
Glad we return'd up to the coasts of <mark1>Light</mark1><br>
Ere Sabbath Eev'ning: so we had in <mark4>charge.</mark4><br>
But thy relation now; for I <mark4>attend,</mark4><br>
Pleas'd with thy words no less then thou with <mark4>mine.</mark4><br>
<br>
So spake the Godlike <mark4>Power</mark4>, and thus our <mark3>Sire.</mark3><br>
For Man to tell how human Life <mark4>began</mark4><br>
Is hard; for who himself beginning <mark3>knew?</mark3><br>
Desire with thee still longer to <mark4>converse</mark4><br>
Induc'd me.   As new wak't from soundest <mark4>sleep</mark4><br>
Soft on the flourie herb I found me <mark4>laid</mark4><br>
In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the <mark1>Sun</mark1><br>
Soon dri'd, and on the reaking moisture <mark4>fed.</mark4><br>
Strait toward Heav'n my wondring Eyes I <mark5>turnd,</mark5><br>
And gaz'd a while the ample Skie, till <mark4>rais'd</mark4><br>
By quick instinctive motion up I <mark1>sprung,</mark1><br>
As thitherward endevoring, and <mark3>upright</mark3><br>
Stood on my feet; about me round I <mark1>saw</mark1><br>
Hill, Dale, and shadie <mark4>Woods</mark4>, and sunnie <mark4>Plaines,</mark4><br>
And liquid Lapse of murmuring <mark4>Streams</mark4>, by <mark1>these,</mark1><br>
Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk'd, or <mark3>flew,</mark3><br>
Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil'd, <br>
With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow'd. <br>
My self I then perus'd, and Limb by <mark4>Limb</mark4><br>
Survey'd, and sometimes went, and sometimes <mark4>ran</mark4><br>
With supple joints, and lively vigour <mark3>led:</mark3><br>
But who I was, or where, or from what <mark4>cause,</mark4><br>
Knew not; to speak I tri'd, and forthwith <mark4>spake</mark4><br>
My Tongue obey'd and readily could <mark4>name</mark4><br>
What e're I saw.   Thou Sun, said I, faire <mark1>Light,</mark1><br>
And thou enlight'nd Earth, so fresh and <mark3>gay,</mark3><br>
Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, <mark4>Woods</mark4>, and <mark1>Plaines,</mark1><br>
And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, <mark3>tell,</mark3><br>
Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how <mark4>here?</mark4><br>
Not of my self; by some great Maker <mark4>then,</mark4><br>
In goodness and in power praeeminent; <br>
Tell me, how may I know him, how <mark4>adore,</mark4><br>
From whom I have that thus I move and <mark1>live,</mark1><br>
And feel that I am happier then I <mark1>know.</mark1><br>
While thus I call'd, and stray'd I knew not <mark4>whither,</mark4><br>
From where I first drew Aire, and first <mark4>beheld</mark4><br>
This happie Light, when answer none <mark4>return'd,</mark4><br>
On a green shadie Bank profuse of <mark1>Flours</mark1><br>
Pensive I sate me down; there gentle <mark1>sleep</mark1><br>
First found me, and with soft oppression <mark4>seis'd</mark4><br>
My droused sense, untroubl'd, though I <mark4>thought</mark4><br>
I then was passing to my former <mark4>state</mark4><br>
Insensible, and forthwith to <mark4>dissolve:</mark4><br>
When suddenly stood at my Head a <mark4>dream,</mark4><br>
Whose inward apparition gently <mark1>mov'd</mark1><br>
My fancy to believe I yet had <mark1>being,</mark1><br>
And livd: One came, methought, of shape <mark1>Divine,</mark1><br>
And said, thy Mansion wants thee, Adam, <mark4>rise,</mark4><br>
First Man, of Men innumerable <mark4>ordain'd</mark4><br>
First Father, call'd by thee I come thy <mark4>Guide</mark4><br>
To the Garden of bliss, thy seat <mark5>prepar'd.</mark5><br>
So saying, by the hand he took me <mark1>rais'd,</mark1><br>
And over Fields and Waters, as in <mark1>Aire</mark1><br>
Smooth sliding without <mark4>step</mark4>, last led me <mark4>up</mark4><br>
A woodie Mountain; whose high top was <mark5>plaine,</mark5><br>
A Circuit wide, enclos'd, with goodliest <mark4>Trees</mark4><br>
Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I <mark1>saw</mark1><br>
Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemd.   Each <mark3>Tree</mark3><br>
Load'n with fairest Fruit that hung to the <mark3>Eye</mark3><br>
Tempting, stirr'd in me sudden <mark4>appetite</mark4><br>
To pluck and eate; whereat I wak'd, and <mark4>found</mark4><br>
Before mine Eyes all real, as the <mark1>dream</mark1><br>
Had lively shadowd: Here had new <mark4>begun</mark4><br>
My wandring, had not hee who was my <mark1>Guide</mark1><br>
Up hither, from among the Trees <mark5>appeer'd</mark5><br>
Presence Divine.   Rejoycing, but with <mark3>aw</mark3><br>
In adoration at his feet I <mark3>fell</mark3><br>
Submiss: he rear'd me, and Whom thou soughtst I <mark4>am,</mark4><br>
Said mildely, Author of all this thou <mark1>seest</mark1><br>
Above, or round about thee or <mark4>beneath.</mark4><br>
This Paradise I give thee, count it <mark4>thine</mark4><br>
To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to <mark1>eate:</mark1><br>
Of every Tree that in the Garden growes <br>
Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no <mark4>dearth:</mark4><br>
But of the Tree whose operation <mark4>brings</mark4><br>
Knowledg of good and ill, which I have <mark1>set</mark1><br>
The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy <mark4>Faith</mark4><br>
Amid the Garden by the Tree of <mark1>Life</mark1><br>
Remember what I warne thee, shun to <mark4>taste,</mark4><br>
And shun the bitter consequence: for <mark1>know,</mark1><br>
The day thou eat'st thereof, my sole <mark4>command</mark4><br>
Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt <mark3>dye;</mark3><br>
From that day mortal, and this happie <mark1>State</mark1><br>
Shalt loose, expell'd from hence into a <mark1>World</mark1><br>
Of woe and sorrow.   Sternly he <mark5>pronounc'd</mark5><br>
The rigid interdiction, which <mark5>resounds</mark5><br>
Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my <mark4>choice</mark4><br>
Not to incur; but soon his cleer <mark4>aspect</mark4><br>
Return'd and gracious purpose thus <mark4>renew'd.</mark4><br>
Not onely these fair bounds, but all the <mark1>Earth</mark1><br>
To thee and to thy Race I give; as <mark4>Lords</mark4><br>
Possess it, and all things that therein <mark1>live,</mark1><br>
Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and <mark4>Fowle.</mark4><br>
In signe whereof each Bird and Beast <mark4>behold</mark4><br>
After thir kindes; I bring them to <mark5>receave</mark5><br>
From thee thir Names, and pay thee <mark5>fealtie</mark5><br>
With low subjection; understand the <mark4>same</mark4><br>
Of Fish within thir watry <mark4>residence,</mark4><br>
Not hither summond, since they cannot <mark4>change</mark4><br>
Thir Element to draw the thinner <mark1>Aire.</mark1><br>
As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast <mark1>behold</mark1><br>
Approaching two and two, These cowring <mark3>low</mark3><br>
With blandishment, each Bird stoop'd on his <mark4>wing.</mark4><br>
I nam'd them, as they pass'd, and <mark4>understood</mark4><br>
Thir Nature, with such knowledg God <mark5>endu'd</mark5><br>
My sudden apprehension: but in <mark1>these</mark1><br>
I found not what me thought I wanted <mark1>still;</mark1><br>
And to the Heav'nly vision thus <mark5>presum'd.</mark5><br>
<br>
O by what Name, for thou above all <mark1>these,</mark1><br>
Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde <mark4>higher,</mark4><br>
Surpassest farr my naming, how may <mark3>I</mark3><br>
Adore thee, Author of this <mark4>Universe,</mark4><br>
And all this good to man, for whose well <mark1>being</mark1><br>
So amply, and with hands so <mark4>liberal</mark4><br>
Thou hast provided all things: but with <mark3>mee</mark3><br>
I see not who partakes.   In <mark4>solitude</mark4><br>
What happiness, who can enjoy <mark4>alone,</mark4><br>
Or all enjoying, what contentment <mark1>find?</mark1><br>
Thus I presumptuous; and the vision <mark4>bright,</mark4><br>
As with a smile more bright'nd, thus <mark1>repli'd.</mark1><br>
What call'st thou solitude, is not the <mark1>Earth</mark1><br>
With various living creatures, and the <mark1>Aire</mark1><br>
Replenisht, and all these at thy <mark1>command</mark1><br>
To come and play before thee, know'st thou <mark1>not</mark1><br>
Thir language and thir wayes, they also <mark1>know,</mark1><br>
And reason not contemptibly; with <mark1>these</mark1><br>
Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is <mark4>large.</mark4><br>
So spake the Universal Lord, and <mark4>seem'd</mark4><br>
So ordering.   I with leave of speech <mark5>implor'd,</mark5><br>
And humble deprecation thus <mark1>repli'd.</mark1><br>
<br>
Let not my words offend thee, Heav'nly <mark4>Power,</mark4><br>
My Maker, be propitious while I <mark1>speak.</mark1><br>
Hast thou not made me here thy <mark4>substitute,</mark4><br>
And these inferiour farr beneath me <mark1>set?</mark1><br>
Among unequals what societie <br>
Can <mark4>sort</mark4>, what harmonie or true <mark4>delight?</mark4><br>
Which must be mutual, in proportion <mark1>due</mark1><br>
Giv'n and receiv'd; but in <mark5>disparitie</mark5><br>
The one <mark4>intense</mark4>, the other still <mark4>remiss</mark4><br>
Cannot well suite with either, but soon <mark4>prove</mark4><br>
Tedious alike: Of fellowship I <mark1>speak</mark1><br>
Such as I seek, fit to <mark4>participate</mark4><br>
All rational <mark4>delight</mark4>, wherein the <mark4>brute</mark4><br>
Cannot be human consort; they <mark1>rejoyce</mark1><br>
Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness; <br>
So fitly them in pairs thou hast <mark5>combin'd;</mark5><br>
Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with <mark1>Fowle</mark1><br>
So well converse, nor with the Ox the <mark4>Ape;</mark4><br>
Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of <mark4>all.</mark4><br>
Whereto th' Almighty answer'd, not <mark5>displeas'd.</mark5><br>
A nice and suttle happiness I <mark3>see</mark3><br>
Thou to thy self proposest, in the <mark1>choice</mark1><br>
Of thy Associates, Adam, and wilt <mark1>taste</mark1><br>
No pleasure, though in pleasure, <mark5>solitarie.</mark5><br>
What thinkst thou then of mee, and this my <mark1>State,</mark1><br>
Seem I to thee sufficiently possest <br>
Of happiness, or not? who am <mark1>alone</mark1><br>
From all Eternitie, for none I <mark1>know</mark1><br>
Second to me or like, equal much <mark4>less.</mark4><br>
How have I then with whom to hold <mark1>converse</mark1><br>
Save with the Creatures which I made, and <mark4>those</mark4><br>
To me inferiour, infinite <mark4>descents</mark4><br>
Beneath what other Creatures are to <mark1>thee?</mark1><br>
He ceas'd, I lowly answer'd.   To <mark5>attaine</mark5><br>
The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes <br>
All human thoughts come short, Supream of <mark4>things;</mark4><br>
Thou in thy self art perfet, and in <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
Is no deficience found; not so is <mark1>Man,</mark1><br>
But in degree, the cause of his <mark1>desire</mark1><br>
By conversation with his like to <mark4>help,</mark4><br>
Or solace his defects.   No need that <mark1>thou</mark1><br>
Shouldst propagat, already <mark4>infinite;</mark4><br>
And through all numbers absolute, though <mark4>One;</mark4><br>
But Man by number is to <mark4>manifest</mark4><br>
His single imperfection, and <mark4>beget</mark4><br>
Like of his like, his Image multipli'd, <br>
In unitie defective, which <mark4>requires</mark4><br>
Collateral love, and deerest amitie. <br>
Thou in thy secresie although <mark1>alone,</mark1><br>
Best with thy self accompanied, seek'st <mark1>not</mark1><br>
Social communication, yet so <mark4>pleas'd,</mark4><br>
Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou <mark4>wilt</mark4><br>
Of Union or Communion, <mark5>deifi'd;</mark5><br>
I by conversing cannot these <mark4>erect</mark4><br>
From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence <mark1>find.</mark1><br>
Thus I embold'nd spake, and freedom <mark4>us'd</mark4><br>
Permissive, and acceptance found, which <mark4>gain'd</mark4><br>
This answer from the gratious voice <mark1>Divine.</mark1><br>
<br>
Thus farr to try thee, Adam, I was <mark1>pleas'd,</mark1><br>
And finde thee knowing not of Beasts <mark1>alone,</mark1><br>
Which thou hast rightly nam'd, but of thy <mark4>self,</mark4><br>
Expressing well the spirit within thee <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
My Image, not imparted to the <mark1>Brute,</mark1><br>
Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
Good reason was thou freely shouldst <mark4>dislike,</mark4><br>
And be so minded still; I, ere thou <mark4>spak'st,</mark4><br>
Knew it not good for Man to be <mark1>alone,</mark1><br>
And no such companie as then thou <mark4>saw'st</mark4><br>
Intended thee, for trial onely <mark1>brought,</mark1><br>
To see how thou could'st judge of fit and <mark4>meet:</mark4><br>
What next I bring shall please thee, be assur'd, <br>
Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other <mark1>self,</mark1><br>
Thy wish exactly to thy hearts <mark1>desire.</mark1><br>
<br>
Hee ended, or I heard no more, for <mark1>now</mark1><br>
My earthly by his Heav'nly overpowerd, <br>
Which it had long stood under, streind to the <mark5>highth</mark5><br>
In that celestial Colloquie <mark4>sublime,</mark4><br>
As with an object that excels the <mark1>sense,</mark1><br>
Dazl d and spent, sunk down, and sought <mark4>repair</mark4><br>
Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, <mark4>call'd</mark4><br>
By Nature as in aide, and clos'd mine <mark4>eyes.</mark4><br>
Mine eyes he clos'd, but op'n left the <mark4>Cell</mark4><br>
Of Fancie my internal sight, by <mark1>which</mark1><br>
Abstract as in a transe methought I <mark1>saw,</mark1><br>
Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the <mark4>shape</mark4><br>
Still glorious before whom awake I <mark4>stood;</mark4><br>
Who stooping op'nd my left side, and <mark4>took</mark4><br>
From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme, <br>
And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the <mark4>wound,</mark4><br>
But suddenly with flesh fill'd up and <mark4>heal'd:</mark4><br>
The Rib he formd and fashond with his <mark4>hands;</mark4><br>
Under his forming hands a Creature <mark1>grew,</mark1><br>
Manlike, but different Sex, so lovly <mark1>faire,</mark1><br>
That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd <mark1>now</mark1><br>
Mean, or in her summd up, in her <mark5>containd</mark5><br>
And in her looks, which from that time <mark5>infus'd</mark5><br>
Sweetness into my heart, unfelt <mark4>before,</mark4><br>
And into all things from her Aire inspir'd <br>
The spirit of love and amorous <mark1>delight.</mark1><br>
Shee disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak'd <br>
To find her, or for ever to <mark3>deplore</mark3><br>
Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure: <br>
When out of hope, behold her, not farr <mark4>off,</mark4><br>
Such as I saw her in my dream, <mark5>adornd</mark5><br>
With what all Earth or Heaven could <mark3>bestow</mark3><br>
To make her amiable: On she <mark4>came,</mark4><br>
Led by her Heav'nly Maker, though <mark4>unseen,</mark4><br>
And guided by his voice, nor uninformd <br>
Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage <mark4>Rites:</mark4><br>
Grace was in all her steps, Heav'n in her <mark1>Eye,</mark1><br>
In every gesture dignitie and <mark4>love.</mark4><br>
I overjoyd could not forbear <mark4>aloud.</mark4><br>
<br>
This turn hath made <mark4>amends</mark4>, thou hast <mark4>fulfill'd</mark4><br>
Thy words, Creator bounteous and <mark5>benigne,</mark5><br>
Giver of all things faire, but fairest <mark4>this</mark4><br>
Of all thy gifts, nor enviest.   I now <mark1>see</mark1><br>
Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my <mark1>Self</mark1><br>
Before me; Woman is her Name, of <mark1>Man</mark1><br>
Extracted; for this cause he shall <mark5>forgoe</mark5><br>
Father and Mother, and to his Wife <mark4>adhere;</mark4><br>
And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one <mark4>Soule.</mark4><br>
<br>
She heard me thus, and though divinely <mark1>brought,</mark1><br>
Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie, <br>
Her vertue and the conscience of her <mark3>worth,</mark3><br>
That would be woo'd, and not unsought be <mark4>won,</mark4><br>
Not obvious, not obtrusive, but <mark5>retir'd,</mark5><br>
The more <mark4>desirable</mark4>, or to say <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
Nature her self, though pure of sinful <mark1>thought,</mark1><br>
Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she <mark4>turn'd;</mark4><br>
I follow'd her, she what was Honour <mark1>knew,</mark1><br>
And with obsequious Majestie <mark5>approv'd</mark5><br>
My pleaded reason.   To the Nuptial <mark1>Bowre</mark1><br>
I led her blushing like the Morn: all <mark1>Heav'n,</mark1><br>
And happie Constellations on that <mark1>houre</mark1><br>
Shed thir selectest influence; the <mark1>Earth</mark1><br>
Gave sign of gratulation, and each <mark4>Hill;</mark4><br>
Joyous the <mark4>Birds</mark4>, fresh Gales and gentle <mark4>Aires</mark4><br>
Whisper'd it to the <mark4>Woods</mark4>, and from thir <mark4>wings</mark4><br>
Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie <mark4>Shrub,</mark4><br>
Disporting, till the amorous Bird of <mark1>Night</mark1><br>
Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning <mark1>Starr</mark1><br>
On his Hill <mark4>top</mark4>, to light the bridal <mark4>Lamp.</mark4><br>
Thus I have told thee all my <mark4>State</mark4>, and <mark1>brought</mark1><br>
My Storie to the sum of earthly <mark3>bliss</mark3><br>
Which I enjoy, and must confess to <mark1>find</mark1><br>
In all things else delight indeed, but <mark1>such</mark1><br>
As us'd or not, works in the mind no <mark1>change,</mark1><br>
Nor vehement desire, these <mark4>delicacies</mark4><br>
I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, and <mark1>Flours,</mark1><br>
Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but <mark1>here</mark1><br>
Farr otherwise, transported I <mark1>behold,</mark1><br>
Transported touch; here passion first I <mark4>felt,</mark4><br>
Commotion strange, in all enjoyments <mark4>else</mark4><br>
Superiour and unmov'd, here onely weake <br>
Against the charm of Beauties powerful <mark4>glance.</mark4><br>
Or Nature faild in mee, and left some <mark1>part</mark1><br>
Not proof enough such Object to <mark4>sustain,</mark4><br>
Or from my side subducting, took <mark1>perhaps</mark1><br>
More then enough; at least on her <mark4>bestow'd</mark4><br>
Too much of Ornament, in outward <mark1>shew</mark1><br>
<mark4>Elaborate</mark4>, of inward less <mark4>exact.</mark4><br>
For well I understand in the prime <mark1>end</mark1><br>
Of Nature her th' inferiour, in the <mark4>mind</mark4><br>
And inward Faculties, which most excell, <br>
In outward also her resembling <mark1>less</mark1><br>
His Image who made both, and less <mark4>expressing</mark4><br>
The character of that Dominion giv'n <br>
O're other Creatures; yet when I <mark4>approach</mark4><br>
Her loveliness, so absolute she <mark4>seems</mark4><br>
And in her self compleat, so well to <mark1>know</mark1><br>
Her own, that what she wills to do or <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, <mark1>best;</mark1><br>
All higher knowledge in her presence <mark4>falls</mark4><br>
Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with <mark5>her</mark5><br>
Looses discount'nanc't, and like folly <mark5>shewes;</mark5><br>
Authority and Reason on her <mark4>waite,</mark4><br>
As one intended first, not after <mark4>made</mark4><br>
Occasionally; and to consummate <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
Greatness of mind and nobleness thir <mark1>seat</mark1><br>
Build in her loveliest, and create an <mark3>awe</mark3><br>
About her, as a guard Angelic <mark5>plac't.</mark5><br>
To whom the Angel with contracted <mark3>brow.</mark3><br>
<br>
Accuse not Nature, she hath don her <mark1>part;</mark1><br>
Do thou but thine, and be not diffident <br>
Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if <mark1>thou</mark1><br>
Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her <mark3>nigh,</mark3><br>
By attributing overmuch to <mark1>things</mark1><br>
Less excellent, as thou thy self <mark5>perceav'st.</mark5><br>
For what admir'st thou, what transports thee <mark3>so,</mark3><br>
An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy <mark4>well</mark4><br>
Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy <mark1>love,</mark1><br>
Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy <mark1>self;</mark1><br>
Then value: Oft times nothing profits <mark4>more</mark4><br>
Then self esteem, grounded on just and <mark4>right</mark4><br>
Well manag'd; of that skill the more thou <mark4>know'st,</mark4><br>
The more she will acknowledge thee her <mark4>Head,</mark4><br>
And to realities yield all her <mark3>shows:</mark3><br>
Made so adorn for thy delight the <mark1>more,</mark1><br>
So awful, that with honour thou maist <mark1>love</mark1><br>
Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least <mark1>wise.</mark1><br>
But if the sense of touch whereby <mark4>mankind</mark4><br>
Is propagated seem such dear <mark1>delight</mark1><br>
Beyond all other, think the same <mark1>voutsaf't</mark1><br>
To Cattel and each Beast; which would not <mark3>be</mark3><br>
To them made common and divulg'd, if <mark4>aught</mark4><br>
Therein enjoy'd were worthy to <mark3>subdue</mark3><br>
The Soule of Man, or passion in him <mark1>move.</mark1><br>
What higher in her societie thou <mark5>findst</mark5><br>
Attractive, human, <mark4>rational</mark4>, love <mark1>still;</mark1><br>
In loving thou dost well, in passion <mark1>not,</mark1><br>
Wherein true Love consists not; love <mark4>refines</mark4><br>
The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his <mark1>seat</mark1><br>
In Reason, and is judicious, is the <mark4>scale</mark4><br>
By which to heav'nly Love thou maist <mark4>ascend,</mark4><br>
Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which <mark1>cause</mark1><br>
Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was <mark1>found.</mark1><br>
<br>
To whom thus half abash't Adam <mark1>repli'd.</mark1><br>
Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor <mark1>aught</mark1><br>
In procreation common to all kindes <br>
(Though higher of the genial Bed by <mark4>far,</mark4><br>
And with mysterious reverence I <mark4>deem)</mark4><br>
So much delights me as those graceful <mark4>acts,</mark4><br>
Those thousand decencies that daily <mark3>flow</mark3><br>
From all her words and actions mixt with <mark1>Love</mark1><br>
And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign'd <br>
Union of Mind, or in us both one <mark1>Soule;</mark1><br>
Harmonie to behold in wedded <mark4>pair</mark4><br>
More grateful then harmonious sound to the <mark1>eare.</mark1><br>
Yet these subject not; I to thee <mark4>disclose</mark4><br>
What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild, <br>
Who meet with various <mark4>objects</mark4>, from the <mark1>sense</mark1><br>
Variously representing; yet still <mark1>free</mark1><br>
Approve the best, and follow what I <mark4>approve.</mark4><br>
To love thou blam'st me not, for love thou saist <br>
Leads up to Heav'n, is both the way and <mark1>guide;</mark1><br>
Bear with me then, if lawful what I <mark1>ask;</mark1><br>
Love not the heav'nly Spirits, and how thir <mark1>Love</mark1><br>
Express they, by looks onely, or do they <mark4>mix</mark4><br>
Irradiance, virtual or immediate <mark4>touch?</mark4><br>
<br>
To whom the Angel with a smile that <mark3>glow'd</mark3><br>
Celestial rosie red, Loves proper <mark3>hue,</mark3><br>
<mark4>Answer'd</mark4>, Let it suffice thee that thou <mark1>know'st</mark1><br>
Us happie, and without Love no <mark4>happiness.</mark4><br>
Whatever pure thou in the body <mark4>enjoy'st</mark4><br>
(And pure thou wert created) we <mark5>enjoy</mark5><br>
In eminence, and obstacle find <mark4>none</mark4><br>
Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive <mark4>barrs:</mark4><br>
Easier then Air with Air; if Spirits <mark4>embrace,</mark4><br>
Total they mix, Union of Pure with <mark1>Pure</mark1><br>
Desiring; nor restrain'd conveyance <mark4>need</mark4><br>
As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with <mark4>Soul.</mark4><br>
But I can now no more; the parting <mark1>Sun</mark1><br>
Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant <mark4>Isles</mark4><br>
Hesperean sets, my Signal to <mark4>depart.</mark4><br>
Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of <mark1>all</mark1><br>
Him whom to love is to obey, and <mark4>keep</mark4><br>
His great command; take heed least Passion <mark3>sway</mark3><br>
Thy judgement to do aught, which else free <mark4>Will</mark4><br>
Would not admit; thine and of all thy <mark4>Sons</mark4><br>
The weal or woe in thee is plac't; <mark4>beware.</mark4><br>
I in thy persevering shall <mark1>rejoyce,</mark1><br>
And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or <mark4>fall</mark4><br>
Free in thine own Arbitrement it <mark4>lies.</mark4><br>
Perfet within, no outward aid <mark4>require;</mark4><br>
And all temptation to transgress <mark4>repel.</mark4><br>
<br>
So saying, he arose; whom Adam <mark4>thus</mark4><br>
Follow'd with benediction.   Since to <mark1>part,</mark1><br>
Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal <mark4>Messenger,</mark4><br>
Sent from whose sovran goodness I <mark1>adore.</mark1><br>
Gentle to me and affable hath <mark4>been</mark4><br>
Thy condescension, and shall be honour'd <mark4>ever</mark4><br>
With grateful Memorie: thou to <mark1>mankind</mark1><br>
Be good and friendly still, and oft <mark1>return.</mark1><br>
<br>
So parted they, the Angel up to <mark1>Heav'n</mark1><br>
From the thick shade, and Adam to his <mark1>Bowre.</mark1><br>
