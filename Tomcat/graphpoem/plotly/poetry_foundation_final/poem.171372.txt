Title : Horses on the Grass <br>
Author : Grace Schulman <br><br>

From the tower window <br>
the <mark4>moon</mark4><br>
draws a silver maple's shadow <br>
across a spangled <mark4>lawn;</mark4><br>
<br>
<mark4>rear</mark4>, manes lashing the <mark4>air,</mark4><br>
front legs <mark4>floating.</mark4><br>
                              Half monarch, <br>
half shadow, the tree   <br>
aspires to the sky; <br>
one branch, cracked by <mark4>lightning,</mark4><br>
scrapes the earth.   <br>
<br>
on the grass, bent <mark4>twigs</mark4><br>
are curved hooves, <mark4>galloping</mark4><br>
as the moon <mark4>rises.</mark4><br>
<br>
Divided it <mark4>stands</mark4><br>
in wholeness, <mark4>mourning</mark4><br>
its victories, <mark4>praising</mark4><br>
the god of <mark4>trees</mark4>, the king of <mark4>horses.</mark4><br>
<br>
The tree holds <mark4>souls</mark4><br>
in a bark <mark4>prison</mark4><br>
poised like a runner at the starting <mark4>line--</mark4><br>
and bolts free, wildly <br>
pawing the ground those roots lie under.<br>
