Title : The Speakers<br>
Author : Weldon Kees<br><br>

"A equals X," says Mister <mark3>One.</mark3><br>
"A equals B," says Mister <mark3>Two.</mark3><br>
"A equals nothing under the <mark3>sun</mark3><br>
But A," says Mister Three. A <mark3>few</mark3><br>
Applaud; some wipe their <mark3>eyes;</mark3><br>
Some linger in the shade to <mark3>see</mark3><br>
One and Two in neat <mark3>disguise</mark3><br>
Decapitating Mister <mark3>Three.</mark3><br>
<br>
"This age is not entirely <mark3>bad."</mark3><br>
It's bad enough, God knows, but <mark3>you</mark3><br>
Should know Elizabethans <mark3>had</mark3><br>
Sweeneys and Mrs. Porters <mark3>too.</mark3><br>
The past goes down and <mark4>disappears,</mark4><br>
The present stumbles home to <mark4>bed,</mark4><br>
The future stretches out in <mark3>years</mark3><br>
That no one knows, and you'll be <mark3>dead.</mark3><br>
