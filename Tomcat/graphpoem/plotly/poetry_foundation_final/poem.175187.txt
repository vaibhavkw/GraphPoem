Not in that wasted garden <br>
Where bodies are drawn into <mark4>grass</mark4><br>
That feeds no flocks, and into <mark4>evergreens</mark4><br>
That bear no fruit -- <br>
There where along the shaded <mark4>walks</mark4><br>
Vain sighs are <mark4>heard,</mark4><br>
And vainer dreams are <mark4>dreamed</mark4><br>
Of close communion with departed souls <mark4>--</mark4><br>
But here under the apple <mark1>tree</mark1><br>
I loved and watched and <mark4>pruned</mark4><br>
With gnarled <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
In the long, long <mark4>years;</mark4><br>
Here under the roots of this northern-spy <br>
To move in the chemic change and circle of life, <br>
Into the soil and into the flesh of the <mark1>tree,</mark1><br>
And into the living <mark4>epitaphs</mark4><br>
Of redder <mark4>apples!</mark4><br>
