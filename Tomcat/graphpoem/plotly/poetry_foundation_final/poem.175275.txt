Title : Consolation <br>
Author : Robert Louis Stevenson <br><br>

Though he, that ever kind and <mark3>true,</mark3><br>
Kept stoutly step by step with <mark3>you,</mark3><br>
Your whole long, gusty lifetime <mark3>through,</mark3><br>
Be gone a while <mark1>before,</mark1><br>
Be now a moment gone <mark1>before,</mark1><br>
Yet, doubt not, soon the seasons shall <mark3>restore</mark3><br>
Your friend to <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
<br>
He has but turned the corner ? <mark3>still</mark3><br>
He pushes on with right good <mark3>will,</mark3><br>
Through mire and marsh, by heugh and <mark3>hill,</mark3><br>
That self-same arduous way <mark1>?</mark1><br>
That self-same upland, hopeful <mark1>way,</mark1><br>
That you and he through many a doubtful <mark3>day</mark3><br>
Attempted <mark1>still.</mark1><br>
<br>
He is not <mark1>dead</mark1>, this friend ? not <mark1>dead,</mark1><br>
But in the path we mortals <mark3>tread</mark3><br>
Got some few, trifling steps <mark3>ahead</mark3><br>
And nearer to the <mark4>end;</mark4><br>
So that you too, once past the <mark3>bend,</mark3><br>
Shall meet again, as face to face, this <mark3>friend</mark3><br>
You fancy <mark1>dead.</mark1><br>
<br>
Push gaily on, strong heart! The <mark4>while</mark4><br>
You travel forward mile by <mark3>mile,</mark3><br>
He loiters with a backward <mark3>smile</mark3><br>
Till you can <mark4>overtake,</mark4><br>
And strains his eyes to search his <mark4>wake,</mark4><br>
Or whistling, as he sees you through the <mark3>brake,</mark3><br>
Waits on a <mark3>stile.</mark3><br>
