Title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 124 <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

That which we dare invoke to <mark3>bless;</mark3><br>
Our dearest faith; our ghastliest <mark3>doubt;</mark3><br>
He, They, One, All; within, <mark3>without;</mark3><br>
The Power in darkness whom we <mark3>guess;</mark3><br>
<br>
I found Him not in world or <mark3>sun,</mark3><br>
Or eagle's wing, or insect's <mark3>eye;</mark3><br>
Nor thro' the questions men may <mark3>try,</mark3><br>
The petty cobwebs we have <mark3>spun:</mark3><br>
<br>
If e'er when faith had fall'n <mark3>asleep,</mark3><br>
I heard a voice, "Believe no <mark3>more,"</mark3><br>
And heard an ever-breaking <mark3>shore</mark3><br>
That tumbled in the Godless <mark3>deep,</mark3><br>
<br>
A warmth within the breast would <mark4>melt</mark4><br>
The freezing reason's colder <mark4>part,</mark4><br>
And like a man in wrath the <mark3>heart</mark3><br>
Stood up and answer'd, "I have <mark4>felt."</mark4><br>
<br>
No, like a child in doubt and <mark4>fear:</mark4><br>
But that blind clamour made me <mark3>wise;</mark3><br>
Then was I as a child that <mark3>cries,</mark3><br>
But crying, knows his father <mark3>near;</mark3><br>
<br>
And what I am beheld <mark4>again</mark4><br>
What <mark4>is</mark4>, and no man <mark4>understands;</mark4><br>
And out of darkness came the <mark3>hands</mark3><br>
That reach thro' nature, moulding <mark3>men.</mark3><br>
