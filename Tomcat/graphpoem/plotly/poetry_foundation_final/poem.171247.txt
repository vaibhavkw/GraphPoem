Title : Passing Through <br>
Author : Ai <br><br>

"Earth is the birth of the blues," sang Yellow <mark4>Bertha,</mark4><br>
as she chopped cotton beside Mama <mark4>Rose.</mark4><br>
It was as hot as any other summer <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
when she decided to run <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
Folks say she made a <mark4>fortune</mark4><br>
running a whorehouse in New <mark4>Orleans,</mark4><br>
but others say she's buried somewhere out <mark4>west,</mark4><br>
her grave <mark4>unmarked,</mark4><br>
though you can find it in the <mark4>dark</mark4><br>
by the scent of jasmine and <mark4>mint,</mark4><br>
but I'm getting ahead of <mark3>myself.</mark3><br>
If it wasn't for <mark4>hell,</mark4><br>
we'd all be tapdancing with the <mark4>devil</mark4><br>
Mama Rose used to <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
but as it is, we just stand and <mark4>watch,</mark4><br>
while someone else burns up before <mark4>salvation.</mark4><br>
"People desire damnation, Bertha," she <mark3>said,</mark3><br>
unwrapping the rag from her <mark3>head</mark3><br>
to let the sweat flow down the corn <mark4>rows,</mark4><br>
plaited as tightly as the night coming <mark4>down</mark4><br>
on the high and mighty on judgment <mark1>day.</mark1><br>
They say she knew what was <mark4>coming,</mark4><br>
because she threw some bones that <mark4>morning.</mark4><br>
She bent down to pick up her rag which had <mark4>fallen</mark4><br>
and when she straightened up, her yellow <mark4>gal</mark4><br>
had gone down the <mark4>road.</mark4><br>
"Go then," she called out, "I didn't want you no how." <br>
Then she started talking to <mark3>herself</mark3><br>
about how Old White John caught her milking <mark4>cows.</mark4><br>
"He wrestled me to the ground and did his <mark4>nastiness."</mark4><br>
He said, "your daddy was a slave and his <mark4>daddy</mark4><br>
and I'm claiming back what's <mark4>mine."</mark4><br>
It was July. I remember fireworks going off <mark4>outside.</mark4><br>
When Bertha come, so <mark4>white</mark4><br>
she liked to scared me to <mark4>death,</mark4><br>
I let her suckle my <mark4>breast</mark4><br>
and I said, "All right, little <mark4>baby,</mark4><br>
maybe I'll love you. <mark3>Maybe."</mark3><br>
Mama Rose said she did her <mark3>best,</mark3><br>
but it's hard to raise a gal like <mark4>that</mark4><br>
with everybody thinking she's giving them the high <mark3>hat,</mark3><br>
because she's so light and got those green <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
that look right through you. She frightens <mark4>people.</mark4><br>
Even men, who're usually wanting to saddle <mark4>up</mark4><br>
and ride that kind of mare, can't abide <mark5>her.</mark5><br>
They're afraid if they try her, they'll never be the <mark4>same.</mark4><br>
The only ones willing are <mark1>white.</mark1><br>
They're watching her day and <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
but they know John swore to kill any <mark4>man</mark4><br>
who touched <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
because lo and behold, he owns up to <mark1>her.</mark1><br>
He's proud of her. Nobody can believe <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
He's even at her <mark4>baptism.</mark4><br>
He buys her cheap dresses and candy at the <mark3>store.</mark3><br>
He hands it to her out the <mark3>door,</mark3><br>
because she can't go <mark4>in.</mark4><br>
He won't, he won't stop looking at <mark1>her</mark1><br>
like it's some kind of miracle she was <mark4>born</mark4><br>
looking so much like him and his <mark1>people.</mark1><br>
It's a <mark4>warning</mark4>, or <mark4>something.</mark4><br>
"It's evil turning back on itself," said the <mark4>preacher</mark4><br>
the Sunday cut clean through by the <mark4>truth,</mark4><br>
by the living proof, as Old John stood up in <mark4>church</mark4><br>
and testified to the power of <mark4>God,</mark4><br>
who spoke to him that <mark1>morning,</mark1><br>
telling him he was a <mark4>sinner.</mark4><br>
He died that winter. Horrible suffering, they <mark1>say.</mark1><br>
He had a stroke on the way to <mark4>town.</mark4><br>
His car ran off the road and he <mark4>drowned.</mark4><br>
They say Bertha found <mark4>him.</mark4><br>
They say she ran all the way to town for the <mark4>doctor,</mark4><br>
who told her, "I am not a colored <mark1>doctor,"</mark1><br>
so she went and got the <mark4>sheriff.</mark4><br>
He listened for a <mark4>while</mark4>, then he locked her in a <mark4>cell.</mark4><br>
He said he knew she was guilty of <mark1>something.</mark1><br>
Well, after a while, Rose went down <mark4>there</mark4><br>
and I swear she nearly had a <mark3>fit.</mark3><br>
"Get my daughter out here," she <mark1>said.</mark1><br>
"How can you lock up your own brother's <mark4>child?"</mark4><br>
The sheriff knew it was true, so finally he <mark1>said,</mark1><br>
"You take her and don't ever cross my path <mark4>again."</mark4><br>
When Bertha passed him on the way <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
he tripped her with his <mark4>foot.</mark4><br>
When she got off the floor, she <mark1>said,</mark1><br>
"Every dog has its <mark1>day."</mark1><br>
<br>
From that time to this is a straight <mark4>line,</mark4><br>
pointing at a <mark4>girl,</mark4><br>
who doesn't even have shoes <mark4>anymore,</mark4><br>
as she runs down the <mark1>road,</mark1><br>
throwing off her ragged <mark3>clothes</mark3>, as she <mark4>goes,</mark4><br>
until she's as naked as the day she was <mark1>born.</mark1><br>
When she comes to washing hanging on the <mark1>line,</mark1><br>
she grabs a fine dress and keeps on <mark4>running.</mark4><br>
She's crying and laughing at the same <mark4>time.</mark4><br>
Along comes a truck that says J. GOODY on the <mark4>side.</mark4><br>
The man driving stops to give her a <mark3>ride.</mark3><br>
He swings the door open on the passenger <mark1>side,</mark1><br>
but Bertha says, "Move over, I'll <mark4>drive."</mark4><br>
When she asks him why he <mark4>stopped,</mark4><br>
he says, "I know white trash, when I see <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
You're just like me, but you're a girl. You're <mark4>pretty.</mark4><br>
You can free yourself. All you have to <mark3>do</mark3><br>
is show a little leg and some titty in the big <mark3>city."</mark3><br>
He gave her fifty cents and a <mark4>wink</mark4><br>
and she started thinking she might as well turn <mark1>white.</mark1><br>
She got a job waiting table in a dance <mark4>hall.</mark4><br>
One night, the boss heard <mark1>her</mark1><br>
singing along with the <mark4>band.</mark4><br>
He said, "Why don't you go up on stage," <br>
and she said, "I play piano <mark3>too."</mark3><br>
He said, "Howdy <mark1>do."</mark1><br>
From then on, she made everybody <mark3>pay</mark3><br>
one way, or <mark4>another.</mark4><br>
She got hard. She took <mark4>lovers--</mark4><br>
fathers, <mark4>sons</mark4>, and <mark4>husbands.</mark4><br>
It didn't <mark4>matter,</mark4><br>
but once in a while, she heard her mother's <mark4>voice,</mark4><br>
saying, "You made the wrong <mark3>choice,"</mark3><br>
and she felt the <mark4>blues</mark4><br>
and she let loose with a <mark4>shout.</mark4><br>
"Lordy," said the boss, "you sound <mark4>colored."</mark4><br>
More and more people came to hear her <mark4>sing,</mark4><br>
but they kind of feared her <mark1>too.</mark1><br>
They said, she was too white to sing the blues like <mark1>that.</mark1><br>
It wasn't <mark4>right.</mark4><br>
One night, she got to talking with the <mark4>boss.</mark4><br>
He walked round and round the office, shaking his <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
saying how much he'd <mark3>lose,</mark3><br>
if she stopped singing the <mark1>blues.</mark1><br>
"How often can you find a treasure like mine," he <mark1>said,</mark1><br>
laying his hand on her <mark4>shoulder,</mark4><br>
then he <mark4>said</mark4>, "If I weren't so <mark4>old,"</mark4><br>
and his voice dropped off to a <mark4>whisper,</mark4><br>
then he said, "I got the answer now, sweet <mark4>Roberta.</mark4><br>
Go on down to the dressing room and <mark4>wait."</mark4><br>
It didn't take <mark4>long.</mark4><br>
He came in and set a jar on the <mark4>table.</mark4><br>
"What do I do with this?" Asked <mark1>Bertha.</mark1><br>
He <mark4>said</mark4>, "you're going to pass for <mark1>colored."</mark1><br>
Suddenly, she was wearing blackface.   <br>
Suddenly, she was safe on the other <mark1>side</mark1><br>
of the door she slammed on the <mark4>past</mark4><br>
and it was standing open at <mark3>last.</mark3><br>
She could come and go as she <mark4>pleased</mark4><br>
and no one saw her enter, or <mark4>leave.</mark4><br>
She was free, she was <mark4>freed,</mark4><br>
but she didn't feel <mark1>it</mark1><br>
and she needed it to be <mark4>real.</mark4><br>
She went on, though. She flowed like a <mark4>river,</mark4><br>
carrying the body of a <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
who had himself a nigger, because he <mark4>could.</mark4><br>
She <mark4>lived</mark4>, She got <mark1>old.</mark1><br>
She almost froze one cold <mark4>spell</mark4><br>
and she got up from her sickbed <br>
and told her <mark4>daughter</mark4><br>
she got during the change of <mark4>life</mark4><br>
it was time to go. <br>
She sewed a note to her ragged <mark4>coat.</mark4><br>
It said, "This is the granddaughter of Mama <mark1>Rose."</mark1><br>
She put fifty cents in her <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
and went to stand with her at the bus <mark4>stop.</mark4><br>
She would not return, but her <mark1>child</mark1><br>
had earned the right to go <mark4>home.</mark4><br>
<br>
When I got off the <mark4>bus,</mark4><br>
a hush fell over the people waiting <mark1>there.</mark1><br>
I was as white as my <mark4>mother,</mark4><br>
but my eyes were gray, not <mark4>green.</mark4><br>
I had hair down to my waist and braids so <mark4>thick</mark4><br>
they weighed me <mark1>down.</mark1><br>
Mother said, my father was a white <mark4>musician</mark4><br>
from another <mark1>town,</mark1><br>
who found out her <mark4>secret</mark4><br>
and left her and me to keep <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
Mama Rose knew me, though, blind as she <mark4>was.</mark4><br>
"What color are you, gal?" She <mark4>asked</mark4><br>
and I told her, "I'm as black as last <mark1>night."</mark1><br>
That's how I passed, without asking <mark4>permission.</mark4><br>
