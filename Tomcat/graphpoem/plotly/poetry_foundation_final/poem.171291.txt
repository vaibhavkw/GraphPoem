Title : A Woman Speaks <br>
Author : Audre Lorde <br><br>

Moon marked and touched by <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
my magic is <mark4>unwritten</mark4><br>
but when the sea turns <mark4>back</mark4><br>
it will leave my shape <mark4>behind.</mark4><br>
I seek no favor <br>
untouched by <mark4>blood</mark4><br>
unrelenting as the curse of love   <br>
permanent as my <mark4>errors</mark4><br>
or my <mark4>pride</mark4><br>
I do not <mark4>mix</mark4><br>
love with <mark4>pity</mark4><br>
nor hate with <mark4>scorn</mark4><br>
and if you would know me <br>
look into the entrails of <mark4>Uranus</mark4><br>
where the restless oceans <mark4>pound.</mark4><br>
<br>
I do not <mark4>dwell</mark4><br>
within my birth nor my <mark4>divinities</mark4><br>
who am ageless and <mark4>half-grown</mark4><br>
and still seeking <br>
my <mark4>sisters</mark4><br>
witches in Dahomey <br>
wear me inside their coiled <mark4>cloths</mark4><br>
as our mother <mark4>did</mark4><br>
<br>
I have been <mark4>woman</mark4><br>
for a long <mark4>time</mark4><br>
beware my <mark4>smile</mark4><br>
I am treacherous with old <mark4>magic</mark4><br>
and the noon's new <mark4>fury</mark4><br>
with all your wide <mark4>futures</mark4><br>
I <mark4>am</mark4><br>
<br>
and not white.<br>
