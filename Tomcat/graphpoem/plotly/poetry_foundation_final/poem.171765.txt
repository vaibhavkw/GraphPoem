Title : The Seventh Inning <br>
Author : Donald Hall <br><br>

1.   Baseball, I warrant, is not the <mark4>whole</mark4><br>
occupation of the aging boy. <br>
Far from it: There are cats and <mark4>roses;</mark4><br>
there is her water body. She <mark4>fills</mark4><br>
the skin of her legs up, like <mark1>water;</mark1><br>
under her blouse, water <mark4>assembles,</mark4><br>
swelling lukewarm; her mouth is <mark1>water,</mark1><br>
her cheekbones cool water; water <mark4>flows</mark4><br>
in her rapid hair. I drink <mark1>water</mark1><br>
<br>
2.   from her body as she walks past <mark3>me</mark3><br>
to open a screen door, as she <mark4>bends</mark4><br>
to weed among <mark4>herbs</mark4>, or as she <mark4>lies</mark4><br>
beside me at five in the <mark4>morning</mark4><br>
in submarine light. Curt Davis <mark3>threw</mark3><br>
a submarine ball, <mark4>terrifying</mark4><br>
to right-handed batters. <mark4>Another</mark4><br>
pleasure, thoroughly <mark4>underrated,</mark4><br>
is micturition, which is <mark4>even</mark4><br>
<br>
3.   commoner than baseball. It <mark4>begins</mark4><br>
by announcing itself more <mark4>slowly</mark4><br>
and less urgently than <mark4>sexual</mark4><br>
desire, but (confusingly) in <mark4>the</mark4><br>
identical place. Ignorant <mark4>men</mark4><br>
therefore on occasion confuse <mark3>beer-</mark3><br>
drinking with love; but I have <mark4>discussed</mark4><br>
adultery elsewhere. We allow <br>
this sweet release to commence itself, <br>
<br>
4.   addressing a urinal <mark5>perhaps,</mark5><br>
perhaps poised over a white <mark4>toilet</mark4><br>
with feet spread wide and head tilted <mark4>back:</mark4><br>
oh, what'delicious permission! <mark4>what</mark4><br>
luxury of letting go! what luxe   <br>
yellow curve of mildest <mark4>ecstasy!</mark4><br>
Granted we may not compare it <mark4>to</mark4><br>
poignant and crimson bliss, it is <mark4>as</mark4><br>
voluptuous as rain all night <mark4>long</mark4><br>
<br>
5.   after baseball in August's parch. <mark1>The</mark1><br>
jade plant's trunk, as thick as a man's <mark4>wrist,</mark4><br>
urges upward thrusting from packed <mark4>dirt,</mark4><br>
with Chinese vigor spreading limbs <mark4>out</mark4><br>
that bear heavy leaves--palpable, <mark4>dark,</mark4><br>
juicy, green, profound: They suck, the <mark3>way</mark3><br>
bleacher fans claim inhabitants <mark4>of</mark4><br>
box seats do. The Fourth of July <mark3>we</mark3><br>
exhaust stars from sparklers in the <mark4>late</mark4><br>
<br>
6.   twilight. We swoop ovals of <mark4>white-gold</mark4><br>
flame, making quick signatures <mark4>against</mark4><br>
an imploding dark. The <mark3>five-year-old</mark3><br>
girl kisses the young dog goodbye <mark4>and</mark4><br>
chases the quick erratic <mark4>kitten.</mark4><br>
When she returns in a few years <mark1>as</mark1><br>
a tall shy girl, she will come back <mark1>to</mark1><br>
a dignified spreading cat and <mark3>a</mark3><br>
dog ash-gray on the muzzle. Sparklers <br>
<br>
7.   expel quickly this night of <mark4>farewell:</mark4><br>
If they didn't burn <mark4>out</mark4>, they <mark4>wouldn't</mark4><br>
be beautiful. Kurt, may I <mark4>hazard</mark4><br>
an opinion on expansion? <mark4>Last</mark4><br>
winter meetings, the major leagues (al- <br>
ready meager in ability, <br>
scanty in starting pitchers) <mark4>voted</mark4><br>
to add two teams. Therefore minor league   <br>
players will advance all too <mark4>quickly,</mark4><br>
<br>
8.   with boys in the bigs who wouldn't <mark4>have</mark4><br>
made double-A forty years ago. <br>
Directors of player <mark3>personnel</mark3><br>
will search like poets scrambling in <mark4>old</mark4><br>
notebooks for unused leftover <mark4>lines,</mark4><br>
but when was the last time <mark4>anyone</mark4><br>
cut back when he or she could <mark4>expand?</mark4><br>
Kurt, I get the notion that you were <br>
another who never <mark4>discarded</mark4><br>
<br>
9.   anything, a keeper from way <mark1>back.</mark1><br>
You smoked cigarettes, in <mark4>inflation-</mark4><br>
times rolled from chopped-up banknotes, <mark4>billions</mark4><br>
inhaled and exhaled as <mark4>cancerous</mark4><br>
smoke. When commerce <mark4>woke</mark4>, Men was <mark4>awake.</mark4><br>
If you smoked a <mark1>cigar</mark1>, the <mark4>cigar</mark4><br>
band discovered itself glued <mark3>into</mark3><br>
collage. Ongoing life became <mark1>the</mark1><br>
material of Kurtschwittersball. <br>
