Title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 82 <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

I wage not any feud with <mark4>Death</mark4><br>
For changes wrought on form and <mark3>face;</mark3><br>
No lower life that earth's <mark3>embrace</mark3><br>
May breed with him, can fright my <mark4>faith.</mark4><br>
<br>
Eternal process moving <mark4>on,</mark4><br>
From state to state the spirit <mark4>walks;</mark4><br>
And these are but the shatter'd <mark3>stalks,</mark3><br>
Or ruin'd chrysalis of <mark4>one.</mark4><br>
<br>
Nor blame I Death, because he bare <br>
The use of virtue out of <mark4>earth:</mark4><br>
I know transplanted human <mark3>worth</mark3><br>
Will bloom to profit, otherwhere. <br>
<br>
For this alone on Death I <mark3>wreak</mark3><br>
The wrath that garners in my <mark3>heart;</mark3><br>
He put our lives so far <mark3>apart</mark3><br>
We cannot hear each other <mark3>speak.</mark3><br>
