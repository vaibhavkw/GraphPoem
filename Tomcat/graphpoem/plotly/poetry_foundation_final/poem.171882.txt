Title : All This and More <br>
Author : Mary Karr <br><br>

The Devil's tour of hell did not <mark4>include</mark4><br>
a factory line where molten <mark4>lead</mark4><br>
spilled into mouths held <mark4>wide,</mark4><br>
<br>
no electric drill spiraling <mark4>screws</mark4><br>
into hands and feet, nor giant <mark4>pliers</mark4><br>
to lower you into simmering <mark4>vats.</mark4><br>
<br>
Instead, a circle of light <br>
opened on your stuffed armchair, <br>
whose chintz orchids did not boil and change, <br>
<br>
and the Devil <mark4>adjusted</mark4><br>
your new spiked antennae <br>
almost delicately, with claws <mark4>curled</mark4><br>
<br>
and lacquered black, before he <mark4>spread</mark4><br>
his leather wings to <mark5>leap</mark5><br>
into the acid-green <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
<br>
So your head became a tv hull, <br>
a gargoyle mirror. Your doppelganger   <br>
sloppy at the mouth <br>
<br>
and swollen at the <mark4>joints</mark4><br>
enacted your days in <mark4>sinuous</mark4><br>
slow motion, your lines <mark4>delivered</mark4><br>
<br>
with a mocking sneer. <mark4>Sometimes</mark4><br>
the frame froze, reversed, <mark4>began</mark4><br>
again: the red eyes of a <mark4>friend</mark4><br>
<br>
you cursed, your girl child cowered   <br>
behind the drapes, parents alive <mark4>again</mark4><br>
and puzzled by this new form. That's <mark3>why</mark3><br>
<br>
you clawed your way back to this life.<br>
