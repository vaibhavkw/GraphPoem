Title : In Love with You<br>
Author : Kenneth Koch<br><br>

<br>
O what a physical effect it has on <mark3>me</mark3><br>
<br>
To dive forever into the light blue <mark3>sea</mark3><br>
Of your acquaintance! Ah, but dearest <mark4>friends,</mark4><br>
Like forms, are finished, as life has ends! <mark3>Still,</mark3><br>
It is beautiful, when <mark4>October</mark4><br>
Is <mark1>over</mark1>, and February is <mark4>over,</mark4><br>
To sit in the starch of my <mark4>shirt</mark4>, and to dream of your <mark4>sweet</mark4><br>
Ways! As if the world were a taxi, you enter it, <mark4>then</mark4><br>
Reply (to no one), "Let's go five or six <mark4>blocks."</mark4><br>
Isn't the blue stream that runs past you a translation from the <mark4>Russian?</mark4><br>
Aren't my eyes bigger than <mark1>love?</mark1><br>
Isn't this history, and aren't we a couple of <mark4>ruins?</mark4><br>
Is Carthage Pompeii? is the pillow the bed? is the <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
What glues our heads together? O midnight! O <mark4>midnight!</mark4><br>
Is love what we <mark3>are,</mark3><br>
Or has happiness come to me in a private <mark3>car</mark3><br>
That's so very small I'm amazed to see it <mark4>there?</mark4><br>
We walk through the park in the sun, and you say, "There's a <mark3>spider</mark3><br>
<br>
Of shadow touching the bench, when morning's begun." I love <mark3>you.</mark3><br>
<br>
I love you fame I love you raining sun I love you cigarettes I love you <mark1>love</mark1><br>
I love you daggers I love smiles daggers and <mark4>symbolism.</mark4><br>
Inside the symposium of your sweetest <mark4>look's</mark4><br>
Sunflower awning by the nurse-faced chrysanthemums childhood<br>
Again represents a summer spent sticking knives into porcelain <mark4>raspberries</mark4>, when <mark4>China's</mark4><br>
<br>
Still a country! Oh, King Edward abdicated years later, <mark4>that's</mark4><br>
<br>
Exactly when. If you were seventy thousand years old, and I were a <mark3>pill,</mark3><br>
I know I could cure your headache, like playing baseball in drinking-water, as <mark4>baskets</mark4><br>
Of towels sweetly touch the bathroom floor! O benches of nothing<br>
Appear and reappear--electricity! I'd love to be how<br>
You are, as if<br>
The world were <mark3>new</mark3>, and the selves were <mark3>blue</mark3><br>
Which we <mark4>don</mark4><br>
Until it's <mark4>dawn,</mark4><br>
Until evening puts <mark3>on</mark3><br>
The gray hooded selves and the light brown selves of . . <mark3>.</mark3><br>
Water! your tear-colored nail polish<br>
Kisses me! and the lumberyard seems <mark3>new</mark3><br>
As a <mark4>calm</mark4><br>
On the sea, where, like <mark4>pigeons,</mark4><br>
I feel so mutated, sad, so breezed, so revivified, and still so unabdicated--<br>
Not like an edge of land coming over the <mark1>sea!</mark1><br>
