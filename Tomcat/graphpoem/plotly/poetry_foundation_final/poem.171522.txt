Title : Dr. Joseph Goebbels (22 April 1945) <br>
Author : W. D. Snodgrass <br><br>

(On this date, Goebbels moved into the lowest level of the bunker, taking a room opposite <mark4>Hitler's.)</mark4><br>
Stand back, make way, you mindless <mark3>scum,</mark3><br>
Squire Voland the Seducer's <mark3>come--</mark3><br>
Old Bock from Babelsberg whose <mark3>tower</mark3><br>
Falls silent now, whose shrunken <mark3>power</mark3><br>
For lies or lays comes hobbling <mark4>home</mark4><br>
Into this concrete <mark4>catacomb.</mark4><br>
<br>
Here's Runty Joe, the cunt <mark4>collector</mark4><br>
Who grew to greatness, first <mark3>erector</mark3><br>
Of myths and <mark4>missions</mark4>, fibs and <mark4>fables,</mark4><br>
Who pulled the wool then turned the <mark3>tables:</mark3><br>
He piped the tunes and called the <mark4>dance</mark4><br>
Where shirtless countries lost their <mark4>pants.</mark4><br>
<br>
Goatfooted Pan, the nation's <mark4>gander</mark4><br>
To whom Pan-Germans all played <mark3>pander,</mark3><br>
The jovial cob-swan quick to <mark4>cover</mark4><br>
Lida Baarova, his check-list <mark3>lover;</mark3><br>
Swellfoot the Tyrant, he could <mark4>riddle</mark4><br>
Men's minds away, hi-diddle-diddle. <br>
<br>
Our little Doctor, Joe the Gimp   <br>
Comes back to limpness and his limp:   <br>
Hephaistos, Vulcan the lame <mark3>smith</mark3><br>
Whose net of lies caught one true <mark3>myth:</mark3><br>
His wife, the famous beauty, whored   <br>
By numbskull Mars, the dull <mark4>warlord.</mark4><br>
<br>
What if I took my little <mark4>fling</mark4><br>
At conquest, at adventuring. <br>
Pried the lid of Pandora's box <mark1>off--</mark1><br>
There's nothing there to bring your rocks <mark1>off.</mark1><br>
I never saw one fucking <mark3>day</mark3><br>
So fine I courted it to <mark3>stay.</mark3><br>
<br>
If I got snarled in my own <mark3>mesh</mark3><br>
Of thighs and bellies, who wants <mark3>flesh?</mark3><br>
I never hankered after <mark4>matter.</mark4><br>
Let Hermann swell up, <mark4>grosser</mark4>, <mark3>fatter,</mark3><br>
Weighed down by medals, houses, <mark4>clothing;</mark4><br>
They leave me lean, secured in <mark4>loathing.</mark4><br>
<br>
As a young man, I pricked the <mark4>bubble</mark4><br>
Of every creed; I saw that <mark3>rubble</mark3><br>
And offered myself the realms of <mark4>earth</mark4><br>
Just to say Yes. But what's it <mark3>worth?</mark3><br>
No thank you, <mark3>Ma'am</mark3>, Behold the <mark4>Ram</mark4><br>
Of God: I doubt, therefore I <mark3>am.</mark3><br>
<br>
Here I forsake that long pricktease   <br>
Of histories, hopes, lusts, <mark4>luxuries.</mark4><br>
I come back to my first <mark4>Ideal--</mark4><br>
The vacancy that's always <mark3>real.</mark3><br>
I sniffed out all life's <mark4>openings:</mark4><br>
I loved only the holes in <mark4>things.</mark4><br>
<br>
So strip down one bare cell for <mark4>this</mark4><br>
Lay Brother of the last <mark3>abyss.</mark3><br>
To me, <mark4>still</mark4>, all abstractions <mark4>smell;</mark4><br>
My head and nose clear in this <mark3>cell</mark3><br>
Of concrete, this confession <mark4>booth</mark4><br>
Where liars face up to blank <mark3>truth.</mark3><br>
<br>
My tongue lashed millions to the <mark4>knife;</mark4><br>
Here, I'll hold hands with my soiled <mark3>wife.</mark3><br>
My lies piped men out, hot to <mark4>slaughter;</mark4><br>
Here, I'll read stories to my <mark3>daughter</mark3><br>
Then hack off all <mark4>relations</mark4>, <mark4>choose</mark4><br>
Only the Nothing you can't <mark3>lose,</mark3><br>
<br>
Send back this body, fixed in <mark4>its</mark4><br>
Infantile <mark4>paralysis.</mark4><br>
I was born small; I shall grow <mark4>less</mark4><br>
Till I burst into <mark4>Nothingness,</mark4><br>
That slot in time where only <mark3>pure</mark3><br>
Spirit extends, absent and <mark3>sure.</mark3><br>
<br>
I am that spirit that <mark4>denies,</mark4><br>
High Priest of Laymen, Prince of <mark3>Lies.</mark3><br>
Your house is founded on my <mark3>rock;</mark3><br>
Truth crows; now I deny my <mark3>cock.</mark3><br>
Jock of this walk, I turn down <mark4>all,</mark4><br>
Robbing my Peter to play <mark3>Paul.</mark3><br>
<br>
I give up all goods I <mark4>possess</mark4><br>
To build my faith on faithlessness. <br>
Black Peter, I belie my <mark4>Lord--</mark4><br>
You've got to die to spread the <mark4>Word.</mark4><br>
Now the last act; there's no <mark4>sequel.</mark4><br>
Soon, once more, all things shall be <mark3>equal.</mark3><br>
