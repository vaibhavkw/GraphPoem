Title : Dear Lacuna, Dear Lard: <br>
Author : Paisley Rekdal <br><br>

I'm here, one fat cherry<br>
               blossom blooming like a clod,<br>
<br>
one sad groat glazing, a needle puling <mark4>thread,</mark4><br>
               so what, so sue me. These days what else to do but leer<br>
<br>
at any boy with just the right hairline. Hey! I <mark1>say,</mark1><br>
               That's one tasty piece of nature. Tart Darkling,<br>
<br>
if I could I'd gin, I'd bargain, I'd take a little <mark4>troll</mark4><br>
this moolit night, let you radish me <mark4>awhile,</mark4><br>
<br>
let you gag and confound me. How much I've <mark4>struggled</mark4><br>
with despicing you, always; your false poppets, <mark4>relentless</mark4><br>
<br>
distances. Yet plea-bargaining and lack of <mark4>conversation</mark4><br>
continue to make <mark1>me</mark1><br>
<br>
your faithful indefile. I'm lonely. I've <mark4>turned</mark4><br>
all rage to rag, all pratfalls fast to fatfalls for <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
<br>
My Farmer in the Dwell. So struggle, <mark5>strife,</mark5><br>
               so strew me, to bell with these clucking mediocrities,<br>
<br>
these anxieties over such beings thirty, still <mark4>smitten</mark4><br>
with this heaven never meant for, never heard <mark4>from.</mark4><br>
<br>
You've said we're each pockmarked like a golf <mark4>course</mark4><br>
with what can't be said of <mark1>us</mark1>, bred in <mark4>us,</mark4><br>
<br>
isn't our tasty piece of nature. But I tell <mark1>you</mark1><br>
I've stars, I've true blue <mark4>depths</mark4>, have learned to <mark4>use</mark4><br>
<br>
the loo, the crew, the whole slough of <mark4>pill-popping</mark4><br>
devices without you, your intelligent and pitiless <mark4>graze.</mark4><br>
<br>
Everyone knows love is just a <mark4>euphemism</mark4><br>
for you've failed me anyway. So screw <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
<br>
Bartering Yam, regardless of want I'm <mark4>nothing</mark4><br>
without scope, hope, <mark1>nothing</mark1><br>
<br>
without your possibility. So let's <mark4>laugh</mark4><br>
like the thieves we are together, the <mark4>sieves:</mark4><br>
<br>
you, my janus gate, my Sigmund <mark4>Fraud,</mark4><br>
               my crawling, crack-crazed street sprawled out,<br>
<br>
revisible, <mark4>spell-bound.</mark4><br>
Hello, joy. I'm thirsty. I'm Pasty <mark4>Rectum.</mark4><br>
<br>
In your absence I've learned to fill <mark4>myself</mark4><br>
with starts. Here's my paters. Here's my <mark3>blue.</mark3><br>
<br>
I just wanted to write again and <mark1>say</mark1><br>
how much I've failed <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
