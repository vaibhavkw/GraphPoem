Title : Revenge <br>
Author : Letitia Elizabeth Landon <br><br>

Ay, gaze upon her rose-wreathed <mark3>hair,</mark3><br>
And gaze upon her <mark3>smile;</mark3><br>
Seem as you drank the very <mark3>air</mark3><br>
Her breath perfumed the <mark3>while:</mark3><br>
<br>
And wake for her the gifted <mark3>line,</mark3><br>
That wild and witching <mark3>lay,</mark3><br>
And swear your heart is as a <mark3>shrine,</mark3><br>
That only owns her <mark3>sway.</mark3><br>
<br>
'Tis well: I am revenged at <mark4>last,--</mark4><br>
Mark you that scornful <mark3>cheek,--</mark3><br>
The eye averted as you <mark4>pass'd,</mark4><br>
Spoke more than words could <mark3>speak.</mark3><br>
<br>
Ay, now by all the bitter <mark4>tears</mark4><br>
That I have shed for <mark3>thee,--</mark3><br>
The racking doubts, the burning <mark3>fears,--</mark3><br>
Avenged they well may <mark3>be--</mark3><br>
<br>
By the nights pass'd in sleepless <mark3>care,</mark3><br>
The days of endless <mark3>woe;</mark3><br>
All that you taught my heart to <mark3>bear,</mark3><br>
All that yourself will <mark3>know.</mark3><br>
<br>
I would not wish to see you <mark4>laid</mark4><br>
Within an early <mark3>tomb;</mark3><br>
I should forget how you <mark4>betray'd,</mark4><br>
And only weep your <mark3>doom:</mark3><br>
<br>
But this is fitting <mark4>punishment,</mark4><br>
To live and love in <mark4>vain,--</mark4><br>
Oh my wrung <mark4>heart</mark4>, be thou <mark4>content,</mark4><br>
And feed upon his <mark3>pain.</mark3><br>
<br>
Go thou and watch her lightest <mark3>sigh,--</mark3><br>
Thine own it will not <mark1>be;</mark1><br>
And bask beneath her sunny <mark3>eye,--</mark3><br>
It will not turn on <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
<br>
'Tis well: the rack, the chain, the <mark4>wheel,</mark4><br>
Far better hadst thou <mark4>proved;</mark4><br>
Ev'n I could almost pity <mark3>feel,</mark3><br>
For thou art nor <mark4>beloved.</mark4><br>
