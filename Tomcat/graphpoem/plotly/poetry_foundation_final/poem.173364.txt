Title : Holy Sonnets: I am a little world made cunningly <br>
Author : John Donne <br><br>

I am a little world made cunningly <br>
Of elements and an angelic <mark3>sprite,</mark3><br>
But black sin hath betray'd to endless <mark3>night</mark3><br>
My world's both parts, and oh both parts must <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
You which beyond that heaven which was most <mark3>high</mark3><br>
Have found new spheres, and of new lands can <mark3>write,</mark3><br>
Pour new seas in mine eyes, that so I <mark3>might</mark3><br>
Drown my world with my weeping earnestly, <br>
Or wash it, if it must be drown'd no <mark4>more.</mark4><br>
But oh it must be burnt; alas the <mark4>fire</mark4><br>
Of lust and envy have burnt it <mark4>heretofore,</mark4><br>
And made it fouler; let their flames <mark4>retire,</mark4><br>
And burn me O Lord, with a fiery <mark3>zeal</mark3><br>
Of thee and thy house, which doth in eating <mark3>heal.</mark3><br>
