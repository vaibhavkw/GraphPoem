Title : The Rape of the Lock: Canto 5 <br>
Author : Alexander Pope <br><br>

She said: the pitying audience melt in <mark3>tears,</mark3><br>
But Fate and Jove had stopp'd the Baron's <mark3>ears.</mark3><br>
In vain Thalestris with reproach <mark4>assails,</mark4><br>
For who can move when fair Belinda <mark3>fails?</mark3><br>
Not half so fix'd the Trojan could <mark3>remain,</mark3><br>
While Anna begg'd and Dido rag'd in <mark3>vain.</mark3><br>
Then grave Clarissa graceful wav'd her <mark4>fan;</mark4><br>
Silence ensu'd, and thus the nymph <mark3>began.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Say, why are beauties prais'd and honour'd <mark3>most,</mark3><br>
The wise man's passion, and the vain man's <mark3>toast?</mark3><br>
Why deck'd with all that land and sea <mark4>afford,</mark4><br>
Why angels <mark4>call'd</mark4>, and angel-like <mark4>ador'd?</mark4><br>
Why round our coaches crowd the white-glov'd <mark5>beaux,</mark5><br>
Why bows the side-box from its inmost <mark4>rows?</mark4><br>
How vain are all these <mark4>glories</mark4>, all our <mark4>pains,</mark4><br>
Unless good sense preserve what beauty <mark3>gains:</mark3><br>
That men may say, when we the front-box <mark4>grace:</mark4><br>
'Behold the first in virtue, as in <mark3>face!'</mark3><br>
Oh! if to dance all night, and dress all <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
Charm'd the smallpox, or chas'd old age <mark3>away;</mark3><br>
Who would not scorn what housewife's cares <mark4>produce,</mark4><br>
Or who would learn one earthly thing of <mark3>use?</mark3><br>
To patch, nay ogle, might become a <mark4>saint,</mark4><br>
Nor could it sure be such a sin to <mark3>paint.</mark3><br>
But since, alas! frail beauty must <mark3>decay,</mark3><br>
Curl'd or uncurl'd, since locks will turn to <mark3>grey,</mark3><br>
Since <mark4>painted</mark4>, or not painted, all shall <mark4>fade,</mark4><br>
And she who scorns a man, must die a <mark3>maid;</mark3><br>
What then remains but well our pow'r to <mark1>use,</mark1><br>
And keep good humour still whate'er we <mark3>lose?</mark3><br>
And trust me, dear! good humour can <mark3>prevail,</mark3><br>
When airs, and flights, and screams, and scolding <mark3>fail.</mark3><br>
Beauties in vain their pretty eyes may <mark4>roll;</mark4><br>
Charms strike the sight, but merit wins the <mark3>soul."</mark3><br>
<br>
       So spoke the dame, but no applause ensu'd; <br>
Belinda frown'd, Thalestris call'd her <mark4>prude.</mark4><br>
"To <mark4>arms</mark4>, to arms!" the fierce virago <mark4>cries,</mark4><br>
And swift as lightning to the combat <mark3>flies.</mark3><br>
All side in parties, and begin th' <mark3>attack;</mark3><br>
Fans clap, silks rustle, and tough whalebones <mark3>crack;</mark3><br>
Heroes' and heroines' shouts confus'dly <mark3>rise,</mark3><br>
And bass, and treble voices strike the <mark3>skies.</mark3><br>
No common weapons in their hands are <mark4>found,</mark4><br>
Like gods they fight, nor dread a mortal <mark3>wound.</mark3><br>
<br>
So when bold Homer makes the gods <mark3>engage,</mark3><br>
And heav'nly breasts with human passions <mark3>rage;</mark3><br>
'Gainst Pallas, Mars; Latona, Hermes <mark4>arms;</mark4><br>
And all Olympus rings with loud <mark3>alarms.</mark3><br>
Jove's thunder roars, heav'n trembles all <mark3>around;</mark3><br>
Blue Neptune storms, the bellowing deeps <mark3>resound;</mark3><br>
Earth shakes her nodding tow'rs, the ground gives <mark3>way;</mark3><br>
And the pale ghosts start at the flash of <mark1>day!</mark1><br>
<br>
Triumphant Umbriel on a sconce's <mark4>height</mark4><br>
Clapp'd his glad wings, and sate to view the <mark3>fight:</mark3><br>
Propp'd on their bodkin spears, the sprites <mark3>survey</mark3><br>
The growing combat, or assist the <mark3>fray.</mark3><br>
<br>
While through the press enrag'd Thalestris <mark1>flies,</mark1><br>
And scatters death around from both her <mark3>eyes,</mark3><br>
A beau and witling perish'd in the <mark3>throng,</mark3><br>
One died in metaphor, and one in <mark3>song.</mark3><br>
"O cruel nymph! a living death I <mark5>bear,"</mark5><br>
Cried Dapperwit, and sunk beside his <mark3>chair.</mark3><br>
A mournful glance Sir Fopling upwards <mark4>cast,</mark4><br>
"Those eyes are made so killing"--was his <mark3>last.</mark3><br>
Thus on Maeeander's flow'ry margin <mark3>lies</mark3><br>
Th' expiring swan, and as he sings he <mark3>dies.</mark3><br>
<br>
When bold Sir Plume had drawn Clarissa <mark3>down,</mark3><br>
Chloe stepp'd <mark4>in</mark4>, and kill'd him with a <mark3>frown;</mark3><br>
She smil'd to see the doughty hero <mark4>slain,</mark4><br>
But at her smile, the beau reviv'd <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
<br>
Now Jove suspends his golden scales in <mark3>air,</mark3><br>
Weighs the men's wits against the lady's <mark3>hair;</mark3><br>
The doubtful beam long nods from side to <mark4>side;</mark4><br>
At length the wits mount up, the hairs <mark3>subside.</mark3><br>
<br>
See, fierce Belinda on the baron <mark1>flies,</mark1><br>
With more than usual lightning in her <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
Nor fear'd the chief th' unequal fight to <mark3>try,</mark3><br>
Who sought no more than on his foe to <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
But this bold lord with manly strength endu'd, <br>
She with one finger and a thumb <mark5>subdu'd:</mark5><br>
Just where the breath of life his nostrils <mark3>drew,</mark3><br>
A charge of snuff the wily virgin <mark3>threw;</mark3><br>
The Gnomes <mark4>direct</mark4>, to ev'ry atom <mark4>just,</mark4><br>
The pungent grains of titillating <mark3>dust.</mark3><br>
Sudden, with starting tears each eye <mark4>o'erflows,</mark4><br>
And the high dome re-echoes to his <mark3>nose.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Now meet thy fate", incens'd Belinda <mark3>cried,</mark3><br>
And drew a deadly bodkin from her <mark1>side.</mark1><br>
(The same, his ancient personage to <mark4>deck,</mark4><br>
Her great great grandsire wore about his <mark3>neck</mark3><br>
In three seal-rings; which after, melted <mark1>down,</mark1><br>
Form'd a vast buckle for his widow's <mark3>gown:</mark3><br>
Her infant grandame's whistle next it <mark3>grew,</mark3><br>
The bells she jingled, and the whistle <mark3>blew;</mark3><br>
Then in a bodkin grac'd her mother's <mark4>hairs,</mark4><br>
Which long she wore, and now Belinda <mark3>wears.)</mark3><br>
<br>
"Boast not my fall," he cried, "insulting <mark3>foe!</mark3><br>
Thou by some other shalt be laid as <mark3>low.</mark3><br>
Nor think, to die dejects my lofty <mark4>mind;</mark4><br>
All that I dread is leaving you benind! <br>
Rather than so, ah let me still <mark5>survive,</mark5><br>
And burn in Cupid's flames--but burn <mark3>alive."</mark3><br>
<br>
"Restore the lock!" she cries; and all <mark1>around</mark1><br>
"Restore the lock!" the vaulted roofs <mark3>rebound.</mark3><br>
Not fierce Othello in so loud a <mark4>strain</mark4><br>
Roar'd for the handkerchief that caus'd his <mark3>pain.</mark3><br>
But see how oft ambitious aims are <mark4>cross'd,</mark4><br>
The chiefs contend 'till all the prize is <mark4>lost!</mark4><br>
The lock, obtain'd with guilt, and kept with <mark1>pain,</mark1><br>
In ev'ry place is sought, but sought in <mark1>vain:</mark1><br>
With such a prize no mortal must be <mark4>blest,</mark4><br>
So Heav'n decrees! with Heav'n who can <mark3>contest?</mark3><br>
<br>
Some thought it mounted to the lunar <mark4>sphere,</mark4><br>
Since all things lost on earth are treasur'd <mark4>there.</mark4><br>
There hero's wits are kept in pond'rous <mark4>vases,</mark4><br>
And beaux' in snuff boxes and tweezercases. <br>
There broken vows and deathbed alms are <mark1>found,</mark1><br>
And lovers' hearts with ends of riband <mark3>bound;</mark3><br>
The courtier's <mark4>promises</mark4>, and sick man's <mark4>prayers,</mark4><br>
The smiles of harlots, and the tears of <mark3>heirs,</mark3><br>
Cages for gnats, and chains to yoke a flea, <br>
Dried butterflies, and tomes of <mark5>casuistry.</mark5><br>
<br>
But trust the Muse--she saw it upward <mark1>rise,</mark1><br>
Though mark'd by none but quick, poetic <mark1>eyes:</mark1><br>
(So Rome's great founder to the heav'ns <mark3>withdrew,</mark3><br>
To Proculus alone confess'd in <mark3>view)</mark3><br>
A sudden <mark4>star</mark4>, it shot through liquid <mark1>air,</mark1><br>
And drew behind a radiant trail of <mark1>hair.</mark1><br>
Not Berenice's locks first rose so <mark4>bright,</mark4><br>
The heav'ns bespangling with dishevell'd <mark3>light.</mark3><br>
The Sylphs behold it kindling as it <mark1>flies,</mark1><br>
And pleas'd pursue its progress through the <mark1>skies.</mark1><br>
<br>
This the beau monde shall from the Mall <mark1>survey,</mark1><br>
And hail with music its propitious <mark3>ray.</mark3><br>
This the blest lover shall for Venus <mark4>take,</mark4><br>
And send up vows from Rosamonda's <mark3>lake.</mark3><br>
This Partridge soon shall view in cloudless <mark1>skies,</mark1><br>
When next he looks through Galileo's <mark1>eyes;</mark1><br>
And hence th' egregious wizard shall foredoom <br>
The fate of Louis, and the fall of <mark4>Rome.</mark4><br>
<br>
Then cease, bright nymph! to mourn thy ravish'd <mark1>hair,</mark1><br>
Which adds new glory to the shining <mark1>sphere!</mark1><br>
Not all the tresses that fair head can <mark4>boast</mark4><br>
Shall draw such envy as the lock you <mark1>lost.</mark1><br>
For, after all the murders of your <mark3>eye,</mark3><br>
When, after millions slain, yourself shall <mark1>die:</mark1><br>
When those fair suns shall <mark4>set</mark4>, as set they <mark4>must,</mark4><br>
And all those tresses shall be laid in <mark1>dust,</mark1><br>
This lock, the Muse shall consecrate to <mark4>fame</mark4><br>
And 'midst the stars inscribe Belinda's <mark3>name.</mark3><br>
