Title : The Marche aux Puces and the Jardin des Plantes <br>
Author : Daryl Hine <br><br>

The sight of beauty simply makes us <mark4>sick:</mark4><br>
There are too many hours in the day,   <br>
Too many wicked faces built like <mark4>flowers</mark4><br>
And far too many bargains for a <mark4>song.</mark4><br>
Jade and paste, cashmere and ormolu-- <br>
Who said that all the arts aspire to <mark4>music?</mark4><br>
It's <mark1>obvious</mark1>, for time is <mark1>obvious,</mark1><br>
That all that art aspires to is <mark4>junk.</mark4><br>
<br>
Blackmailed by these mathoms of the <mark4>past,</mark4><br>
One is indebted for another perspective   <br>
To quaint giraffes and quainter <mark4>wallabies,</mark4><br>
The nearly human and the faintly <mark4>monstrous,</mark4><br>
The outrageously contemporary <mark4>joke.</mark4><br>
Trespassing on a no man's territory, <br>
Unlike the moralist one is at a <mark4>loss</mark4><br>
Where to be human is not to be at <mark4>home.</mark4><br>
<br>
In a zoo, you see, one can acquire <mark4>nothing:</mark4><br>
Zebras aren't wishes. Nor is the flea <mark4>market</mark4><br>
Exactly the place for those who know what they <mark4>want.</mark4><br>
Like far out stations on the Metro (which they are)   <br>
Somewhere, in heaven perhaps, they correspond,   <br>
In the heaven of open arms and unpaid <mark4>bills,</mark4><br>
Where beer is drunk on the lawn all afternoon   <br>
And every night we bid, and make, a <mark4>slam.</mark4><br>
