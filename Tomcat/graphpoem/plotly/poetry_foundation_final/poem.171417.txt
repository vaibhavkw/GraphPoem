Title : In the Kingdom of Pleasure <br>
Author : Alan R. Shapiro <br><br>

Unwitting accomplice in the scheme of law   <br>
she thought to violate, man-set as it <mark4>was,</mark4><br>
and, here, inconsequential as the <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
at midnight, drought at <mark4>flood-time--</mark4><br>
when she heard a baby in the tall <mark4>reeds</mark4><br>
at the river's brink, she was <mark4>nobody's</mark4><br>
daughter, subject of no <mark4>rule</mark4><br>
but the one his need for her established   <br>
as she knelt down to quell his <mark4>crying</mark4><br>
with a little tune just seeing him <mark4>there</mark4><br>
had taught her how to <mark4>hum.</mark4><br>
<br>
Now as <mark4>then,</mark4><br>
it is the same tune, timelessly in <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
your mother hums as she kneels <mark4>down</mark4><br>
beside your little barge of <mark4>foam,</mark4><br>
smiling to see you smile when she wrings <br>
out from the sponge a ragged <mark4>string</mark4><br>
of water over the chest and <mark4>belly,</mark4><br>
the dimpled loins, the bud so <mark4>far</mark4><br>
from flowering, and the foot slick <br>
as a fish your hand tries to hold <mark4>up</mark4><br>
till it slips back <mark4>splashing</mark4><br>
with such mild turbulence that she <mark5>laughs,</mark5><br>
and you laugh to see her <mark5>laugh.</mark5><br>
<br>
Here now, as it was then, it is <mark4>still</mark4><br>
so many years before the blood's <mark4>smeared</mark4><br>
over doorposts, before the Nile <mark4>clots</mark4><br>
with the <mark4>first-born</mark4>, and the <mark4>women</mark4><br>
wailing,wailing throughout the <mark4>city;</mark4><br>
here now again is the kingdom of pleasure,   <br>
where they are safe still, mother and <mark4>child,</mark4><br>
from the chartered rod of the <mark4>Fathers,</mark4><br>
and where a father can still pray, <mark4>Lord,</mark4><br>
Jealous Chooser, Devouring Law, <mark4>keep</mark4><br>
away from them, just keep away.<br>
