Title : The Knight's Tomb <br>
Author : Samuel Taylor Coleridge <br><br>

<br>
Where is the grave of Sir Arthur O'Kellyn?<br>
Where may the grave of that good man <mark3>be?--</mark3><br>
By the side of a spring, on the breast of Helvellyn,<br>
Under the twigs of a young birch <mark3>tree!</mark3><br>
The oak that in summer was sweet to <mark4>hear,</mark4><br>
And rustled its leaves in the fall of the <mark4>year,</mark4><br>
And whistled and roared in the winter <mark3>alone,</mark3><br>
Is gone,--and the birch in its stead is <mark3>grown.--</mark3><br>
The Knight's bones are <mark3>dust,</mark3><br>
And his good sword <mark3>rust;--</mark3><br>
His soul is with the saints, I <mark3>trust.</mark3><br>
