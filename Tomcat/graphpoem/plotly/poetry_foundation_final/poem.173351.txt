Title : A Burnt Ship <br>
Author : John Donne <br><br>

Out of a fired ship, which by no <mark3>way</mark3><br>
But drowning could be rescued from the <mark3>flame,</mark3><br>
Some men leap'd forth, and ever as they <mark3>came</mark3><br>
Near the foes' ships, did by their shot <mark3>decay;</mark3><br>
So all were lost, which in the ship were found, <br>
      They in the sea being burnt, they in the burnt ship drown'd. <br>
