Title : Holy Sonnets: This is my play's last scene <br>
Author : John Donne <br><br>

This is my play's last scene; here heavens <mark3>appoint</mark3><br>
My pilgrimage's last mile; and my <mark3>race,</mark3><br>
Idly, yet quickly run, hath this last <mark3>pace,</mark3><br>
My span's last inch, my minute's latest <mark3>point;</mark3><br>
And gluttonous death will instantly unjoint <br>
My body and my soul, and I shall sleep a <mark3>space;</mark3><br>
But my'ever-waking part shall see that <mark3>face</mark3><br>
Whose fear already shakes my every <mark3>joint.</mark3><br>
Then, as my soul to'heaven, her first <mark4>seat</mark4>, takes <mark4>flight,</mark4><br>
And earth-born body in the earth shall <mark3>dwell,</mark3><br>
So fall my sins, that all may have their <mark3>right,</mark3><br>
To where they'are bred, and would press me, to <mark3>hell.</mark3><br>
Impute me righteous, thus purg'd of <mark4>evil,</mark4><br>
For thus I leave the world, the flesh, the <mark4>devil.</mark4><br>
