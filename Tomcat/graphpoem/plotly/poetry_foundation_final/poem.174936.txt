Title : The Gardener 85 <br>
Author : Rabindranath Tagore <br><br>

Who are you, reader, reading my poems an hundred years hence?<br>
I cannot send you one single flower from this wealth of the spring, one single streak of gold from yonder <mark4>clouds.</mark4><br>
Open your doors and look abroad.<br>
<br>
From your blossoming garden gather fragrant memories of the vanished flowers of an hundred years before.<br>
In the joy of your heart may you feel the living joy that sang one spring morning, sending its glad voice across an hundred <mark4>years.</mark4><br>
