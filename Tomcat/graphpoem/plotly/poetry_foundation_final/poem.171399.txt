Title : Rapture <br>
Author : Galway Kinnell <br><br>

I can feel she has got out of <mark4>bed.</mark4><br>
That means it is seven <mark4>a.m.</mark4><br>
I have been lying with eyes <mark4>shut,</mark4><br>
<mark4>thinking</mark4>, or possibly <mark4>dreaming,</mark4><br>
of how she might look if, at <mark4>breakfast,</mark4><br>
I spoke about the hidden place in her   <br>
which, to me, is like a soprano's tremolo, <br>
and right then, over toast and bramble jelly, <br>
if such things are possible, she <mark4>came.</mark4><br>
I imagine she would show it while trying to conceal <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
I imagine her hair would fall about her face <br>
and she would become apparently <mark4>downcast,</mark4><br>
as she does at a concert when she is <mark4>moved.</mark4><br>
The hypnopompic play <mark4>passes</mark4>, and I open my <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
and there she is, next to the <mark1>bed,</mark1><br>
bending to a low drawer, picking <mark4>over</mark4><br>
various small smooth black, <mark4>white,</mark4><br>
and pink items of underwear. She <mark4>bends</mark4><br>
so low her back runs parallel to the <mark1>earth,</mark1><br>
but there is no sway in it, there is little <mark4>burden</mark4>, the day has hardly <mark4>begun.</mark4><br>
The two mounds of muscles for walking, <mark4>leaping</mark4>, <mark4>lovemaking,</mark4><br>
lift toward the east--what can I say? <br>
Simile is useless; there is nothing like them on <mark1>earth.</mark1><br>
Her breasts fall full; the <mark4>nipples</mark4><br>
are deep pink in the glare shining up through the iron <mark4>bars</mark4><br>
of the gate under the earth where those who could not <mark5>love</mark5><br>
press, wanting to be born <mark4>again.</mark4><br>
I reach out and take her <mark4>wrist</mark4><br>
and she falls back into bed and at once starts unbuttoning my <mark4>pajamas.</mark4><br>
Later, when I open my eyes, there she is <mark1>again,</mark1><br>
rummaging in the same low drawer.   <br>
The clock shows eight. Hmmm.   <br>
With huge, silent effort of <mark4>great,</mark4><br>
mounded muscles the earth has been <mark4>turning.</mark4><br>
She takes a piece of silken <mark4>cloth</mark4><br>
from the drawer and stands up. Under the <mark4>falls</mark4><br>
of hair her face has become quiet and <mark1>downcast,</mark1><br>
as if she will be, all day among <mark4>strangers,</mark4><br>
looking down inside herself at our <mark4>rapture.</mark4><br>
