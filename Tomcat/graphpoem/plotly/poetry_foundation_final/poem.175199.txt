Title : Mrs. Kessler <br>
Author : Edgar Lee Masters <br><br>

Mr. Kessler, you know, was in the army, <br>
And he drew six dollars a month as a pension, <br>
And stood on the corner talking <mark4>politics,</mark4><br>
Or sat at home reading Grant's <mark4>Memoirs;</mark4><br>
And I supported the family by washing, <br>
Learning the secrets of all the <mark4>people</mark4><br>
From their curtains, counterpanes, shirts and <mark4>skirts.</mark4><br>
For things that are new grow old at length, <br>
They're replaced with better or none at <mark4>all:</mark4><br>
People are prospering or falling back. <br>
And rents and patches widen with time; <br>
No thread or needle can pace decay, <br>
And there are stains that baffle soap, <br>
And there are colors that run in spite of you, <br>
Blamed though you are for spoiling a <mark4>dress.</mark4><br>
Handkerchiefs, napery, have their <mark4>secrets</mark4><br>
The laundress, Life, knows all about <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
And I, who went to all the <mark4>funerals</mark4><br>
Held in Spoon <mark4>River</mark4>, swear I <mark4>never</mark4><br>
Saw a dead face without thinking it <mark4>looked</mark4><br>
Like something washed and ironed.<br>
