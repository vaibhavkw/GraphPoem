Title : Thompson's Lunch Room--Grand Central Station <br>
Author : Amy Lowell <br><br>

STUDY IN <mark4>WHITES</mark4><br>
<br>
Floor, ceiling, <mark4>walls.</mark4><br>
Ivory <mark4>shadows</mark4><br>
Over the <mark4>pavement</mark4><br>
Polished to cream <mark4>surfaces</mark4><br>
By constant sweeping. <br>
The big room is coloured like the <mark4>petals</mark4><br>
Of a great <mark4>magnolia,</mark4><br>
And has a <mark4>patina</mark4><br>
Of flower <mark5>bloom</mark5><br>
Which makes it shine <mark4>dimly</mark4><br>
Under the electric <mark4>lamps.</mark4><br>
Chairs are ranged in <mark4>rows</mark4><br>
Like sepia <mark4>seeds</mark4><br>
Waiting fulfilment. <br>
The chalk-white spot of a cook's cap <br>
Moves unglossily against the vaguely bright <mark5>wall--</mark5><br>
Dull chalk-white striking the retina like a <mark5>blow</mark5><br>
Thru the wavering uncertainty of <mark4>steam.</mark4><br>
Vitreous-white of glasses with green <mark4>reflections,</mark4><br>
Ice-green carboys, shifting--greener, bluer--with the jar of moving <mark4>water.</mark4><br>
Jagged green-white bowls of pressed <mark4>glass</mark4><br>
Rearing snow-peaks of chipped <mark4>sugar</mark4><br>
Above the lighthouse-shaped castors <br>
Of grey pepper and grey-white <mark4>salt.</mark4><br>
Grey-white placards: "Oyster Stew, Cornbeef Hash, <mark4>Frankfurters":</mark4><br>
Marble slabs veined with words in meandering <mark4>lines.</mark4><br>
Dropping on the white counter like horn <mark4>notes</mark4><br>
Through a web of <mark4>violins,</mark4><br>
The flat yellow lights of <mark4>oranges,</mark4><br>
The cube-red splashes of <mark4>apples,</mark4><br>
In high plated epergnes. <br>
The electric clock jerks every <mark4>half-minute:</mark4><br>
<br>
"Three beef-steaks and a chicken-pie," <br>
Bawled through a slide while the clock jerks <mark4>heavily.</mark4><br>
A man carries a china mug of coffee to a distant chair. <br>
Two rice puddings and a salmon <mark5>salad</mark5><br>
Are pushed over the <mark4>counter;</mark4><br>
The unfulfilled chairs open to receive <mark4>them.</mark4><br>
A spoon falls upon the floor with the impact of metal striking stone, <br>
And the sound throws across the <mark4>room</mark4><br>
Sharp, invisible <mark4>zigzags</mark4><br>
Of <mark4>silver.</mark4><br>
