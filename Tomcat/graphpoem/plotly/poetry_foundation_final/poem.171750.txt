Title : Liberty <br>
Author : Archibald MacLeish <br><br>

When liberty is headlong <mark3>girl</mark3><br>
And runs her roads and wends her <mark3>ways</mark3><br>
Liberty will shriek and <mark3>whirl</mark3><br>
Her showery torch to see it <mark3>blaze.</mark3><br>
<br>
When liberty is wedded <mark3>wife</mark3><br>
And keeps the barn and counts the byre   <br>
Liberty amends her <mark3>life.</mark3><br>
She drowns her torch for fear of fire. <br>
