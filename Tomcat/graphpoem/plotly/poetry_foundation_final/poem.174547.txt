Author : Algernon Charles Swinburne <br><br>

Love, what ailed thee to leave life that was made lovely, we thought, with <mark3>love?</mark3><br>
What sweet visions of sleep lured thee away, down from the light <mark3>above?</mark3><br>
<br>
What strange faces of dreams, voices that called, hands that were raised to <mark4>wave,</mark4><br>
Lured or led thee, alas, out of the sun, down to the sunless <mark3>grave?</mark3><br>
<br>
Ah, thy luminous eyes! once was their light fed with the fire of <mark3>day;</mark3><br>
Now their shadowy lids cover them close, hush them and hide <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
<br>
Ah, thy snow-coloured hands! once were they chains, mighty to bind me <mark3>fast;</mark3><br>
Now no blood in them burns, mindless of love, senseless of passion <mark3>past.</mark3><br>
<br>
Ah, thy beautiful hair! so was it once braided for <mark1>me</mark1>, for <mark1>me;</mark1><br>
Now for death is it crowned, only for death, lover and lord of <mark3>thee.</mark3><br>
<br>
Sweet, the kisses of death set on thy lips, colder are they than <mark3>mine;</mark3><br>
Colder surely than past kisses that love poured for thy lips as <mark3>wine.</mark3><br>
<br>
Lov'st thou death? is his face fairer than love's, brighter to look <mark4>upon?</mark4><br>
Seest thou light in his eyes, light by which love's pales and is overshone? <br>
<br>
Lo the roses of death, grey as the dust, chiller of leaf than <mark3>snow!</mark3><br>
Why let fall from thy hand love's that were thine, roses that loved thee <mark3>so?</mark3><br>
<br>
Large red lilies of love, sceptral and tall, lovely for eyes to <mark3>see;</mark3><br>
Thornless blossom of love, full of the sun, fruits that were reared for <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
<br>
Now death's poppies alone circle thy hair, girdle thy breasts as <mark4>white;</mark4><br>
Bloodless blossoms of death, leaves that have sprung never against the <mark3>light.</mark3><br>
<br>
Nay then, sleep if thou wilt; love is content; what should he do to <mark3>weep?</mark3><br>
Sweet was love to thee once; now in thine eyes sweeter than love is <mark3>sleep.</mark3><br>
