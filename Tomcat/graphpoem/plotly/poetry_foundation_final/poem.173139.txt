Title : To my Inconstant Mistress <br>
Author : Thomas Carew <br><br>

When thou, poor <mark4>excommunicate</mark4><br>
From all the joys of love, shalt <mark3>see</mark3><br>
The full reward and glorious <mark4>fate</mark4><br>
Which my strong faith shall purchase <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
Then curse thine own <mark4>inconstancy.</mark4><br>
<br>
A fairer hand than thine shall <mark3>cure</mark3><br>
That heart, which thy false oaths did <mark3>wound;</mark3><br>
And to my soul, a soul more <mark3>pure</mark3><br>
Than thine shall by Love's hand be <mark3>bound,</mark3><br>
    And both with equal glory crown'd.<br>
<br>
Then shalt thou weep, entreat, <mark3>complain</mark3><br>
To Love, as I did once to <mark3>thee;</mark3><br>
When all thy tears shall be as <mark3>vain</mark3><br>
As mine were then, for thou shalt <mark3>be</mark3><br>
    Damn'd for thy false apostasy.<br>
