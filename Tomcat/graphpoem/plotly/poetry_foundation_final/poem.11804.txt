Title : Entirely<br>
Author : Louis MacNeice<br><br>

If we could get the hang of it <mark4>entirely</mark4><br>
It would take too <mark4>long;</mark4><br>
All we know is the splash of words in <mark4>passing</mark4><br>
And falling twigs of <mark4>song,</mark4><br>
And when we try to eavesdrop on the <mark4>great</mark4><br>
Presences it is <mark4>rarely</mark4><br>
That by a stroke of luck we can <mark4>appropriate</mark4><br>
Even a phrase <mark1>entirely.</mark1><br>
<br>
If we could find our happiness <mark1>entirely</mark1><br>
In somebody else's <mark4>arms</mark4><br>
We should not fear the spears of the spring nor the <mark4>city's</mark4><br>
Yammering fire <mark4>alarms</mark4><br>
But, as it is, the spears each year go <mark3>through</mark3><br>
Our flesh and almost <mark4>hourly</mark4><br>
Bell or siren banishes the <mark3>blue</mark3><br>
Eyes of Love <mark1>entirely.</mark1><br>
<br>
And if the world were black or white <mark1>entirely</mark1><br>
And all the charts were <mark3>plain</mark3><br>
Instead of a mad weir of tigerish <mark4>waters,</mark4><br>
A prism of delight and <mark3>pain,</mark3><br>
We might be surer where we wished to <mark3>go</mark3><br>
Or again we might be <mark4>merely</mark4><br>
Bored but in brute reality there is <mark3>no</mark3><br>
Road that is right <mark1>entirely.</mark1><br>
