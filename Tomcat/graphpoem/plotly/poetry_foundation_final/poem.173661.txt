Title : 'I wake and feel the fell of dark, not day' <br>
Author : Gerard Manley Hopkins <br><br>

I wake and feel the fell of dark, not <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
What hours, O what black hours we have <mark3>spent</mark3><br>
This night! what sights you, heart, saw; ways you <mark3>went!</mark3><br>
And more must, in yet longer light's <mark3>delay.</mark3><br>
With witness I speak this. But where I <mark3>say</mark3><br>
Hours I mean years, mean life. And my <mark3>lament</mark3><br>
Is cries countless, cries like dead letters <mark3>sent</mark3><br>
To dearest him that lives alas! <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
<br>
I am gall, I am heartburn. God's most deep <mark3>decree</mark3><br>
Bitter would have me taste: my taste was <mark3>me;</mark3><br>
Bones built in me, flesh filled, blood brimmed the <mark3>curse.</mark3><br>
Selfyeast of spirit a dull dough sours. I <mark3>see</mark3><br>
The lost are like this, and their scourge to <mark3>be</mark3><br>
As I am mine, their sweating selves; but <mark3>worse.</mark3><br>
