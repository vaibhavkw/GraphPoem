Maurice, weep not, I am not here under this pine tree. <br>
The balmy air of spring whispers through the sweet <mark4>grass,</mark4><br>
The stars sparkle, the whippoorwill calls, <br>
But thou grievest, while my soul lies <mark4>rapturous</mark4><br>
In the blest Nirvana of eternal light! <br>
Go to the good heart that is my husband, <br>
Who broods upon what he calls our guilty love: i <br>
Tell him that my love for you, no less than my love for him <br>
Wrought out my destiny i that through the flesh <br>
I won spirit, and through spirit, <mark4>peace.</mark4><br>
There is no marriage in heaven, <br>
But there is love. <br>
