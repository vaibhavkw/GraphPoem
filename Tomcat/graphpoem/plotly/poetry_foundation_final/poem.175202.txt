You may think, passer-by, that <mark4>Fate</mark4><br>
Is a pit-fall outside of <mark4>yourself,</mark4><br>
Around which you may walk by the use of <mark4>foresight</mark4><br>
And wisdom.<br>
Thus you believe, viewing the lives of other men,<br>
As one who in God-like fashion bends over an anthill,<br>
Seeing how their difficulties could be avoided.<br>
But pass on into <mark4>life:</mark4><br>
In time you shall see Fate approach <mark5>you</mark5><br>
In the shape of your own image in the mirror;<br>
Or you shall sit alone by your own hearth,<br>
And suddenly the chair by you shall hold a <mark4>guest,</mark4><br>
And you shall know that <mark1>guest,</mark1><br>
And read the authentic message of his eyes.<br>
