Title : Journey to the Place of Ghosts <br>
Author : Jay Wright <br><br>

Wolbe dich, Welt: Wenn die Totenmuschel heranschwimmt, will es hier lauten.  Vault over, world: when the seashell of death washes up  there will be a knelling. <br>
--Paul Celan, Stimmen (Voices)<br>
<br>
Death knocks all night at my <mark4>door.</mark4><br>
The soul <mark4>answers,</mark4><br>
and runs from the water in my <mark1>throat.</mark1><br>
Water will sustain me when I climb   <br>
the steep <mark4>hill</mark4><br>
that leads to a now familiar <mark4>place.</mark4><br>
I began, even as a child, to learn water's order,   <br>
and, as I grew intact, the feel of its <mark4>warmth</mark4><br>
in a new sponge, of its weight in a virgin <mark4>towel.</mark4><br>
I have earned my wine in another's <mark4>misery,</mark4><br>
when rum bathed a sealed <mark1>throat</mark1><br>
and cast its seal on the <mark4>ground.</mark4><br>
I will be bound, to the one who leads me <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
by the ornaments on my wrists, the gold <mark4>dust</mark4><br>
in my ears, below my eye and tied to <mark3>my</mark3><br>
                        loincloth in a leather pouch.   <br>
They dress me now in my best <mark4>cloth,</mark4><br>
and fold my hands, adorned with <mark4>silk,</mark4><br>
against my left <mark4>cheek.</mark4><br>
Gold lies with me on my left <mark4>side.</mark4><br>
Gold has become the color of <mark4>distance,</mark4><br>
                              and of your sorrow. <br>
<br>
Sorrow lies, red clay on my brow. <br>
Red pepper caresses my <mark4>temples.</mark4><br>
I am adorned in the russet-brown message   <br>
the soul brings from its coming-to-be.   <br>
There is a silken despair in my <mark4>body</mark4><br>
that grief shakes from <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
a cat's voice, controlled by palm <mark4>wine</mark4><br>
and a widow's <mark4>passion.</mark4><br>
It is time to feed the <mark4>soul</mark4><br>
--a hen, <mark4>eggs</mark4>, mashed <mark4>yams--</mark4><br>
and encourage the thirst <mark4>resting</mark4><br>
near the right hand I see before <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
Always I think of <mark4>death.</mark4><br>
I cannot <mark4>eat.</mark4><br>
I walk in sadness, and I <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
Yet life is the invocation sealed in the <mark4>coffin,</mark4><br>
and will walk through our <mark4>wall,</mark4><br>
passing and passing and <mark4>passing,</mark4><br>
until it is set <mark4>down,</mark4><br>
to be lifted from this body's <mark4>habitation.</mark4><br>
I now assume the widow's <mark4>pot,</mark4><br>
the lamp that will lead me through <mark4>solitude,</mark4><br>
to the edge of my husband's <mark4>journey.</mark4><br>
I hold three stones upon my <mark4>head,</mark4><br>
darkness I will release when I <mark4>run</mark4><br>
from the <mark3>dead,</mark3><br>
with my eyes turned <mark1>away</mark1><br>
toward another <mark4>light.</mark4><br>
<br>
This is the day of <mark4>rising.</mark4><br>
A hut sits in the bush, sheltered by summe,   <br>
standing on four forked <mark4>ends.</mark4><br>
We have prepared for the soul's <mark4>feast</mark4><br>
with pestle, mortar, a strainer, <mark3>three</mark3><br>
hearthstones, a new pot and new <mark4>spoon.</mark4><br>
Someone has stripped the hut's <mark1>body</mark1><br>
and dressed it with the edowa. <br>
Now, when the wine <mark4>speaks</mark4><br>
and the fire has lifted its <mark4>voice,</mark4><br>
the dead will be clothed in <mark4>hair,</mark4><br>
the signs of our <mark4>grief.</mark4><br>
Sun closes down on an intensity of <mark4>ghosts.</mark4><br>
It is time to close the <mark4>path.</mark4><br>
It is time for the snail's <mark4>pace</mark4><br>
of coming again into <mark4>life,</mark4><br>
with the world swept <mark4>clean,</mark4><br>
the crying <mark4>done,</mark4><br>
and our ordinary garments decent in the dead one's <mark4>eyes.</mark4><br>
