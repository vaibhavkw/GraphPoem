Title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 116 <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

Is it, then, regret for buried <mark3>time</mark3><br>
That keenlier in sweet April <mark3>wakes,</mark3><br>
And meets the year, and gives and <mark3>takes</mark3><br>
The colours of the crescent <mark3>prime?</mark3><br>
<br>
Not all: the songs, the stirring <mark3>air,</mark3><br>
The life re-orient out of <mark3>dust,</mark3><br>
Cry thro' the sense to hearten <mark3>trust</mark3><br>
In that which made the world so <mark3>fair.</mark3><br>
<br>
Not all regret: the face will <mark4>shine</mark4><br>
Upon me, while I muse <mark4>alone;</mark4><br>
And that dear voice, I once have <mark3>known,</mark3><br>
Still speak to me of me and <mark4>mine:</mark4><br>
<br>
Yet less of sorrow lives in <mark3>me</mark3><br>
For days of happy commune <mark3>dead;</mark3><br>
Less yearning for the friendship <mark3>fled,</mark3><br>
Than some strong bond which is to <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
