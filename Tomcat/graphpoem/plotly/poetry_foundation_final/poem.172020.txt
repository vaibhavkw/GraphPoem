Title : For The Marriage of Faustus and Helen <br>
Author : Hart Crane <br><br>

"And so we may arrive by Talmud skill And profane Greek to raise the building up Of Helen's house against the Ismaelite, King of Thogarma, and his habergeons Brimstony, blue and fiery; and the force Of King Abaddon, and the beast of Cittim; Which Rabbi David Kimchi, Onkelos, And Aben Ezra do interpret Rome."  --THE <mark4>ALCHEMIST.</mark4><br>
<br>
The mind has shown itself at <mark4>times</mark4><br>
Too much the baked and labeled <mark3>dough</mark3><br>
Divided by accepted <mark4>multitudes.</mark4><br>
Across the stacked partitions of the <mark3>day--</mark3><br>
Across the memoranda, baseball <mark4>scores,</mark4><br>
The stenographic smiles and stock <mark4>quotations</mark4><br>
Smutty wings flash out <mark5>equivocations.</mark5><br>
The mind is brushed by sparrow <mark4>wings;</mark4><br>
<br>
Numbers, rebuffed by asphalt, <mark4>crowd</mark4><br>
The margins of the day, accent the <mark4>curbs,</mark4><br>
Convoying divers dawns on every <mark4>corner</mark4><br>
To druggist, barber and tobacconist, <br>
Until the graduate opacities of <mark4>evening</mark4><br>
Take them away as suddenly to <mark4>somewhere</mark4><br>
Virginal perhaps, less fragmentary, <mark4>cool.</mark4><br>
There is the world dimensional <mark4>for</mark4><br>
<br>
those untwisted by the love of <mark4>things</mark4><br>
irreconcilable <mark4>...</mark4><br>
And <mark4>yet</mark4>, suppose some evening I <mark4>forgot</mark4><br>
<br>
The fare and transfer, yet got by that <mark3>way</mark3><br>
Without recall,--lost yet poised in <mark4>traffic.</mark4><br>
Then I might find your eyes across an <mark4>aisle,</mark4><br>
Still flickering with those prefigurations-- <br>
Prodigal, yet uncontested <mark3>now,</mark3><br>
Half-riant before the jerky window <mark3>frame.</mark3><br>
There is some way, I think, to touch <br>
<br>
Those hands of yours that count the <mark4>nights</mark4><br>
Stippled with pink and green <mark4>advertisements.</mark4><br>
And now, before its arteries turn <mark4>dark</mark4><br>
I would have you meet this bartered <mark4>blood.</mark4><br>
Imminent in his dream, none better <mark4>knows</mark4><br>
The white wafer cheek of love, or offers <mark4>words</mark4><br>
Lightly as moonlight on the eaves meets <mark3>snow.</mark3><br>
Reflective conversion of all <mark1>things</mark1><br>
<br>
At your deep blush, when ecstasies <mark4>thread</mark4><br>
The limbs and belly, when rainbows <mark3>spread</mark3><br>
Impinging on the throat and sides <mark4>...</mark4><br>
Inevitable, the body of the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
Weeps in inventive dust for the <mark4>hiatus</mark4><br>
That winks above it, bluet in your <mark4>breasts.</mark4><br>
The earth may glide diaphanous to <mark1>death;</mark1><br>
<br>
But if I lift my arms it is to <mark4>bend</mark4><br>
To you who turned away once, Helen, <mark4>knowing</mark4><br>
The press of troubled hands, too <mark4>alternate</mark4><br>
With steel and soil to hold you <mark4>endlessly.</mark4><br>
I meet you, therefore, in that eventual <mark3>flame</mark3><br>
You found in final chains, no captive <mark4>then--</mark4><br>
Beyond their million brittle, bloodshot <mark4>eyes;</mark4><br>
White, through white cities passed on to <mark4>assume</mark4><br>
That world which comes to each of us <mark4>alone.</mark4><br>
Accept a lone eye riveted to your <mark4>plane,</mark4><br>
Bent axle of devotion along companion <mark4>ways</mark4><br>
That beat, continuous, to hourless <mark3>days--</mark3><br>
One inconspicuous, glowing orb of <mark3>praise.</mark3><br>
Brazen hypnotics glitter <mark4>here;</mark4><br>
<br>
Glee shifts from foot to <mark4>foot,</mark4><br>
<br>
Magnetic to their tremulo. <br>
This crashing opera bouffe, <br>
Blest excursion! this ricochet <br>
From roof to roof-- <br>
Know, Olympians, we are <mark4>breathless</mark4><br>
While nigger cupids scour the <mark4>stars!</mark4><br>
A thousand light shrugs balance <mark4>us</mark4><br>
Through snarling hails of <mark4>melody.</mark4><br>
White shadows slip across the <mark4>floor</mark4><br>
<br>
Splayed like cards from a loose <mark4>hand;</mark4><br>
Rhythmic ellipses lead into canters <br>
Until somewhere a rooster banters. <br>
Greet naively--yet <mark4>intrepidly</mark4><br>
New soothings, new amazements <br>
That cornets introduce at every <mark4>turn--</mark4><br>
<br>
And you may fall downstairs with <mark3>me</mark3><br>
With perfect grace and <mark4>equanimity.</mark4><br>
Or, plaintively scud past <mark4>shores</mark4><br>
Where, by strange harmonic <mark4>laws</mark4><br>
All relatives, serene and <mark1>cool,</mark1><br>
Sit rocked in patent <mark4>armchairs.</mark4><br>
O,I have known metallic paradises <br>
Where cuckoos clucked to <mark4>finches</mark4><br>
Above the deft catastrophes of <mark4>drums.</mark4><br>
<br>
While titters hailed the groans of <mark1>death</mark1><br>
Beneath gyrating awnings I have <mark4>seen</mark4><br>
The incunabula of the divine <mark4>grotesque.</mark4><br>
This music has a reassuring <mark1>way.</mark1><br>
The siren of the springs of guilty <mark4>song--</mark4><br>
Let us take her on the incandescent <mark4>wax</mark4><br>
Striated with nuances, nervosities <br>
<br>
That we are heir to: she is still so <mark4>young,</mark4><br>
We cannot frown upon her as she <mark4>smiles,</mark4><br>
Dipping here in this cultivated <mark4>storm</mark4><br>
Among slim skaters of the gardened <mark4>skies.</mark4><br>
Capped arbiter of beauty in this <mark4>street</mark4><br>
That narrows darkly into motor <mark4>dawn,--</mark4><br>
You, here beside me, delicate <mark4>ambassador</mark4><br>
<br>
Of intricate slain numbers that <mark3>arise</mark3><br>
<br>
In whispers, naked of <mark4>steel;</mark4><br>
religious <mark4>gunman!</mark4><br>
Who faithfully, yourself, will fall too <mark4>soon,</mark4><br>
And in other ways than as the wind <mark4>settles</mark4><br>
On the sixteen thrifty bridges of the <mark4>city:</mark4><br>
Let us unbind our throats of fear and <mark3>pity.</mark3><br>
We <mark4>even,</mark4><br>
Who drove speediest <mark4>destruction</mark4><br>
In corymbulous formations of <mark4>mechanics,--</mark4><br>
Who hurried the hill breezes, spouting <mark4>malice</mark4><br>
Plangent over meadows, and looked <mark4>down</mark4><br>
<br>
On rifts of torn and empty <mark4>houses</mark4><br>
Like old women with teeth unjubilant <br>
That waited faintly, briefly and in <mark4>vain:</mark4><br>
We know, eternal gunman, our flesh <mark4>remembers</mark4><br>
The tensile boughs, the nimble blue <mark5>plateaus,</mark5><br>
The mounted, yielding cities of the <mark4>air!</mark4><br>
That saddled sky that shook down <mark4>vertical</mark4><br>
Repeated play of fire--no hypogeum <br>
<br>
Of wave or rock was good against one <mark4>hour.</mark4><br>
We did not ask for that, but have <mark4>survived,</mark4><br>
And will persist to speak again <mark4>before</mark4><br>
<br>
All stubble streets that have not <mark4>curved</mark4><br>
To memory, or known the ominous lifted <mark4>arm</mark4><br>
That lowers down the arc of Helen's <mark3>brow</mark3><br>
To saturate with blessing and <mark3>dismay.</mark3><br>
A goose, tobacco and <mark4>cologne</mark4><br>
Three winged and gold-shod prophecies of <mark4>heaven,</mark4><br>
The lavish heart shall always have to <mark3>leaven</mark3><br>
And spread with bells and voices, and <mark4>atone</mark4><br>
The abating shadows of our conscript <mark4>dust.</mark4><br>
<br>
Anchises' navel, dripping of the <mark3>sea,--</mark3><br>
The hands Erasmus dipped in gleaming <mark4>tides,</mark4><br>
Gathered the voltage of blown blood and <mark4>vine;</mark4><br>
Delve upward for the new and scattered <mark3>wine,</mark3><br>
O brother-thief of time, that we <mark4>recall.</mark4><br>
<br>
Laugh out the meager penance of their <mark1>days</mark1><br>
Who dare not share with us the breath <mark4>released,</mark4><br>
The substance drilled and spent beyond <mark4>repair</mark4><br>
For golden, or the shadow of gold <mark3>hair.</mark3><br>
Distinctly praise the years, whose <mark4>volatile</mark4><br>
Blamed bleeding hands extend and thresh the <mark4>height</mark4><br>
The imagination spans beyond <mark3>despair,</mark3><br>
Outpacing bargain, vocable and <mark3>prayer.</mark3><br>
