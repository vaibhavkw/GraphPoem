Title : The Funeral <br>
Author : John Donne <br><br>

Whoever comes to shroud me, do not <mark3>harm</mark3><br>
Nor question <mark3>much</mark3><br>
That subtle wreath of hair, which crowns my <mark3>arm;</mark3><br>
The mystery, the sign, you must not <mark3>touch,</mark3><br>
For 'tis my outward <mark3>soul,</mark3><br>
Viceroy to that, which then to heaven being <mark4>gone,</mark4><br>
Will leave this to <mark3>control</mark3><br>
And keep these limbs, her provinces, from <mark4>dissolution.</mark4><br>
<br>
For if the sinewy thread my brain lets <mark4>fall</mark4><br>
Through every <mark3>part</mark3><br>
Can tie those parts, and make me one of <mark3>all,</mark3><br>
Those hairs which upward grew, and strength and <mark3>art</mark3><br>
Have from a better <mark4>brain,</mark4><br>
Can better do'it; except she meant that <mark3>I</mark3><br>
By this should know my <mark3>pain,</mark3><br>
As prisoners then are manacled, when they'are condemn'd to <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
<br>
Whate'er she meant by'it, bury it with me, <br>
For since I <mark4>am</mark4><br>
Love's martyr, it might breed <mark4>idolatry,</mark4><br>
If into other hands these relics <mark4>came;</mark4><br>
As 'twas <mark4>humility</mark4><br>
To afford to it all that a soul can <mark3>do,</mark3><br>
So, 'tis some <mark4>bravery,</mark4><br>
That since you would have none of me, I bury some of <mark3>you.</mark3><br>
