Title : Alas Madam for Stealing of a Kiss <br>
Author : Sir Thomas Wyatt <br><br>

Alas, madam, for stealing of a <mark3>kiss</mark3><br>
Have I so much your mind there <mark3>offended?</mark3><br>
Have I then done so grievously <mark3>amiss</mark3><br>
That by no means it may be <mark3>amended?</mark3><br>
<br>
Then revenge you, and the next way is <mark3>this:</mark3><br>
Another kiss shall have my life <mark3>ended,</mark3><br>
For to my mouth the first my heart did <mark3>suck;</mark3><br>
The next shall clean out of my breast it <mark3>pluck.</mark3><br>
