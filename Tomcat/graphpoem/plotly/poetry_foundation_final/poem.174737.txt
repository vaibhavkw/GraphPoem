Title : Beat! Beat! Drums! <br>
Author : Walt Whitman <br><br>

Beat! beat! drums!--blow! bugles! <mark1>blow!</mark1><br>
Through the windows--through doors--burst like a ruthless <mark4>force,</mark4><br>
Into the solemn church, and scatter the <mark4>congregation,</mark4><br>
Into the school where the scholar is <mark4>studying,</mark4><br>
Leave not the bridegroom quiet--no happiness must he have now with his bride, <br>
Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his field or gathering his <mark4>grain,</mark4><br>
So fierce you whirr and pound you drums--so shrill you bugles <mark1>blow.</mark1><br>
<br>
Beat! beat! drums!--blow! bugles! <mark1>blow!</mark1><br>
Over the traffic of cities--over the rumble of wheels in the <mark4>streets;</mark4><br>
Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses? no sleepers must sleep in those <mark4>beds,</mark4><br>
No bargainers' bargains by day--no brokers or speculators--would they <mark5>continue?</mark5><br>
Would the talkers be talking? would the singer attempt to <mark4>sing?</mark4><br>
Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the judge? <br>
Then rattle quicker, heavier drums--you bugles wilder <mark1>blow.</mark1><br>
<br>
Beat! beat! drums!--blow! bugles! <mark1>blow!</mark1><br>
Make no parley--stop for no expostulation, <br>
Mind not the timid--mind not the weeper or prayer, <br>
Mind not the old man beseeching the young <mark4>man,</mark4><br>
Let not the child's voice be heard, nor the mother's <mark4>entreaties,</mark4><br>
Make even the trestles to shake the dead where they lie awaiting the hearses, <br>
So strong you thump O terrible drums--so loud you bugles <mark1>blow.</mark1><br>
