Title : Ianthe! You are Call'd to Cross the Sea <br>
Author : Walter Savage Landor <br><br>

Ianthe! you are call'd to cross the <mark3>sea!</mark3><br>
A path forbidden <mark3>me!</mark3><br>
Remember, while the Sun his blessing <mark3>sheds</mark3><br>
Upon the <mark3>mountain-heads,</mark3><br>
How often we have watcht him laying <mark4>down</mark4><br>
His brow, and dropt our <mark4>own</mark4><br>
Against each other's, and how faint and <mark3>short</mark3><br>
And sliding the <mark3>support!</mark3><br>
What will succeed it now? Mine is unblest, <br>
Ianthe! nor will <mark4>rest</mark4><br>
But on the very thought that swells with <mark4>pain.</mark4><br>
O bid me hope <mark3>again!</mark3><br>
O give me back what Earth, what (without <mark3>you)</mark3><br>
Not Heaven itself can <mark3>do--</mark3><br>
One of the golden days that we have <mark4>past,</mark4><br>
And let it be my <mark3>last!</mark3><br>
Or else the gift would be, however <mark4>sweet,</mark4><br>
Fragile and <mark3>incomplete.</mark3><br>
