Title : Divine Epigrams: On the Baptized Ethiopian <br>
Author : Richard Crashaw <br><br>

Let it no longer be a forlorn hope <br>
         To wash an Ethiope; <br>
He's wash'd, his gloomy skin a peaceful <mark3>shade,</mark3><br>
For his white soul is <mark3>made;</mark3><br>
And now, I doubt not, the Eternal <mark3>Dove</mark3><br>
A black-fac'd house will <mark3>love.</mark3><br>
