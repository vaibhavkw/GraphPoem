Title : On Stella's Birth-day <br>
Author : Jonathan Swift <br><br>

Stella this Day is thirty <mark3>four,</mark3><br>
(We won't dispute a Year or <mark3>more)</mark3><br>
However Stella, be not <mark3>troubled,</mark3><br>
Although thy Size and Years are <mark3>doubled,</mark3><br>
Since first I saw Thee at <mark3>Sixteen</mark3><br>
The brightest Virgin of the <mark3>Green,</mark3><br>
So little is thy Form declin'd <br>
Made up so largely in thy <mark4>Mind.</mark4><br>
Oh, would it please the Gods to <mark3>split</mark3><br>
Thy Beauty, Size, and Years, and <mark3>Wit,</mark3><br>
No Age could furnish out a <mark4>Pair</mark4><br>
Of Nymphs so gracefull, Wise and <mark3>fair</mark3><br>
With half the Lustre of Your <mark3>Eyes,</mark3><br>
With half thy Wit, thy Years and <mark3>Size:</mark3><br>
And then before it grew too <mark4>late,</mark4><br>
How should I beg of gentle <mark3>Fate,</mark3><br>
(That either Nymph might have her <mark4>Swain,)</mark4><br>
To split my Worship too in <mark3>twain.</mark3><br>
