Title : DECEMBER. [1757] XII Month. <br>
Author : Benjamin Franklin <br><br>

Would you be well receiv'd where'er you <mark3>go,</mark3><br>
Remember each Man vanquish'd is a <mark3>Foe:</mark3><br>
Resist not therefore to your utmost <mark3>Might,</mark3><br>
But let the Weakest think he's sometimes <mark3>right;</mark3><br>
He, for each Triumph you shall thus <mark3>decline,</mark3><br>
Shall give ten Opportunities to <mark3>shine;</mark3><br>
He sees, since once you own'd him to <mark3>excel,</mark3><br>
That 'tis his Interest you should reason <mark3>well.</mark3><br>
