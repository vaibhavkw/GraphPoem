Title : To Robert Browning <br>
Author : Walter Savage Landor <br><br>

There is delight in singing, tho' none <mark4>hear</mark4><br>
Beside the singer; and there is delight <br>
In praising, tho' the praiser sit <mark4>alone</mark4><br>
And see the prais'd far off him, far above. <br>
Shakspeare is not our poet, but the <mark4>world's,</mark4><br>
Therefore on him no speech! and brief for thee, <br>
Browning! Since Chaucer was alive and hale, <br>
No man hath walkt along our roads with step <br>
So active, so inquiring eye, or <mark4>tongue</mark4><br>
So varied in discourse. But warmer <mark4>climes</mark4><br>
Give brighter plumage, stronger wing: the <mark4>breeze</mark4><br>
Of Alpine highths thou playest with, borne <mark4>on</mark4><br>
Beyond Sorrento and Amalfi, <mark4>where</mark4><br>
The Siren waits thee, singing song for <mark4>song.</mark4><br>
