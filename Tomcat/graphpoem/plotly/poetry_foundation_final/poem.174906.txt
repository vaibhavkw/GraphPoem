Title : In the Jewish Synagogue at Newport <br>
Author : Emma Lazarus <br><br>

<br>
Here, where the noises of the busy <mark4>town,</mark4><br>
The ocean's plunge and roar can enter <mark3>not,</mark3><br>
We stand and gaze around with tearful <mark3>awe,</mark3><br>
And muse upon the consecrated <mark3>spot.</mark3><br>
<br>
No signs of life are here: the very <mark4>prayers</mark4><br>
Inscribed around are in a language <mark3>dead;</mark3><br>
The light of the "perpetual lamp" is <mark4>spent</mark4><br>
That an undying radiance was to <mark3>shed.</mark3><br>
<br>
What prayers were in this temple offered <mark4>up,</mark4><br>
Wrung from sad hearts that knew no joy on <mark3>earth,</mark3><br>
By these lone exiles of a thousand <mark4>years,</mark4><br>
From the fair sunrise land that gave them <mark3>birth!</mark3><br>
<br>
How as we gaze, in this new world of <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
Upon this relic of the days of <mark4>old,</mark4><br>
The present vanishes, and tropic bloom<br>
And Eastern towns and temples we <mark3>behold.</mark3><br>
<br>
Again we see the patriarch with his <mark4>flocks,</mark4><br>
The purple <mark4>seas</mark4>, the hot blue sky <mark4>o'erhead,</mark4><br>
The slaves of Egypt,--omens, <mark4>mysteries,--</mark4><br>
Dark fleeing hosts by flaming angels <mark4>led.</mark4><br>
<br>
A wondrous light upon a sky-kissed <mark4>mount,</mark4><br>
A man who reads Jehovah's written <mark3>law,</mark3><br>
'Midst blinding glory and effulgence rare,<br>
Unto a people prone with reverent <mark1>awe.</mark1><br>
<br>
The pride of luxury's barbaric <mark4>pomp,</mark4><br>
In the rich court of royal <mark4>Solomon--</mark4><br>
Alas! we wake: one scene alone <mark4>remains,--</mark4><br>
The exiles by the streams of <mark4>Babylon.</mark4><br>
<br>
Our softened voices send us back <mark4>again</mark4><br>
But mournful echoes through the empty <mark3>hall:</mark3><br>
Our footsteps have a strange unnatural <mark4>sound,</mark4><br>
And with unwonted gentleness they <mark3>fall.</mark3><br>
<br>
The weary ones, the sad, the suffering,<br>
All found their comfort in the holy <mark4>place,</mark4><br>
And children's gladness and men's <mark4>gratitude</mark4><br>
'Took voice and mingled in the chant of <mark4>praise.</mark4><br>
<br>
The funeral and the marriage, now, <mark4>alas!</mark4><br>
We know not which is sadder to <mark3>recall;</mark3><br>
For youth and happiness have followed age,<br>
And green grass lieth gently over <mark3>all.</mark3><br>
<br>
Nathless the sacred shrine is holy <mark4>yet,</mark4><br>
With its lone floors where reverent feet once <mark4>trod.</mark4><br>
Take off your shoes as by the burning bush,<br>
Before the mystery of death and <mark3>God.</mark3><br>
