Title : Thanksgiving <br>
Author : Edgar Albert Guest <br><br>

Gettin' together to smile an' <mark3>rejoice,</mark3><br>
An' eatin' an' laughin' with folks of your <mark3>choice;</mark3><br>
An' kissin' the girls an' declarin' that <mark3>they</mark3><br>
Are growin' more beautiful day after <mark3>day;</mark3><br>
Chattin' an' braggin' a bit with the <mark3>men,</mark3><br>
Buildin' the old family circle <mark3>again;</mark3><br>
Livin' the wholesome an' old-fashioned <mark3>cheer,</mark3><br>
Just for awhile at the end of the <mark3>year.</mark3><br>
<br>
Greetings fly fast as we crowd through the <mark4>door</mark4><br>
And under the old roof we gather once <mark3>more</mark3><br>
Just as we did when the youngsters were <mark3>small;</mark3><br>
Mother's a little bit grayer, that's <mark3>all.</mark3><br>
Father's a little bit older, but <mark4>still</mark4><br>
Ready to romp an' to laugh with a <mark3>will.</mark3><br>
Here we are back at the table <mark1>again</mark1><br>
Tellin' our stories as women an' <mark1>men.</mark1><br>
<br>
Bowed are our heads for a moment in <mark4>prayer;</mark4><br>
Oh, but we're grateful an' glad to be <mark3>there.</mark3><br>
Home from the east land an' home from the <mark3>west,</mark3><br>
Home with the folks that are dearest an' <mark3>best.</mark3><br>
Out of the sham of the cities <mark4>afar</mark4><br>
We've come for a time to be just what we <mark3>are.</mark3><br>
Here we can talk of ourselves an' be <mark3>frank,</mark3><br>
Forgettin' position an' station an' <mark3>rank.</mark3><br>
<br>
Give me the end of the year an' its <mark4>fun</mark4><br>
When most of the plannin' an' toilin' is <mark3>done;</mark3><br>
Bring all the wanderers home to the <mark3>nest,</mark3><br>
Let me sit down with the ones I love <mark1>best,</mark1><br>
Hear the old voices still ringin' with <mark3>song,</mark3><br>
See the old faces unblemished by <mark3>wrong,</mark3><br>
See the old table with all of its <mark3>chairs</mark3><br>
An' I'll put soul in my Thanksgivin' <mark3>prayers.</mark3><br>
