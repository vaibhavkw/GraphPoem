Title : Etude Realiste <br>
Author : Algernon Charles Swinburne <br><br>

<br>
A baby's feet, like sea-shells <mark3>pink,</mark3><br>
Might <mark4>tempt</mark4>, should heaven see <mark4>meet,</mark4><br>
An angel's lips to kiss, we <mark3>think,</mark3><br>
A baby's <mark3>feet.</mark3><br>
Like rose-hued sea-flowers toward the <mark3>heat</mark3><br>
<br>
They stretch and spread and <mark3>wink</mark3><br>
Their ten soft buds that part and <mark1>meet.</mark1><br>
No flower-bells that expand and <mark3>shrink</mark3><br>
<br>
Gleam half so heavenly <mark3>sweet</mark3><br>
As shine on life's untrodden <mark3>brink</mark3><br>
A Baby's <mark1>feet.</mark1><br>
A baby's hands, like rosebuds furled <br>
<br>
Whence yet no leaf <mark3>expands,</mark3><br>
Ope if you touch, though close upcurled, <br>
A baby's <mark3>hands.</mark3><br>
Then, fast as warriors grip their <mark3>brands</mark3><br>
When battle's bolt is <mark3>hurled,</mark3><br>
<br>
They <mark4>close</mark4>, clenched hard like tightening <mark3>bands.</mark3><br>
No rosebuds yet by dawn impearled <br>
Match, even in loveliest <mark3>lands,</mark3><br>
<br>
The sweetest flowers in all the <mark3>world--</mark3><br>
A baby's <mark1>hands.</mark1><br>
A baby's eyes, ere speech <mark3>begin,</mark3><br>
Ere lips learn words or <mark4>sighs,</mark4><br>
<br>
Bless all things bright enough to <mark3>win</mark3><br>
A baby's <mark3>eyes.</mark3><br>
Love, while the sweet thing laughs and <mark3>lies,</mark3><br>
And sleep flows out and <mark3>in,</mark3><br>
Sees perfect in them Paradise. <br>
<br>
Their glance might cast out pain and <mark3>sin,</mark3><br>
Their speech make dumb the <mark3>wise,</mark3><br>
By mute glad godhead felt <mark3>within</mark3><br>
<br>
A baby's <mark1>eyes.</mark1><br>
