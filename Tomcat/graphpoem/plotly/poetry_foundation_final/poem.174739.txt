Title : I Saw in Louisiana A Live-Oak Growing <br>
Author : Walt Whitman <br><br>

I saw in Louisiana a live-oak growing, <br>
All alone stood it and the moss hung down from the <mark4>branches,</mark4><br>
Without any companion it grew there uttering joyous leaves of dark green, <br>
And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of myself, <br>
But I wonder'd how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone there without its friend near, for I knew I could <mark1>not,</mark1><br>
And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it, and twined around it a little <mark4>moss,</mark4><br>
And brought it away, and I have placed it in sight in my <mark4>room,</mark4><br>
It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear <mark4>friends,</mark4><br>
(For I believe lately I think of little else than of <mark4>them,)</mark4><br>
Yet it remains to me a curious token, it makes me think of manly love; <br>
For all that, and though the live-oak glistens there in Louisiana solitary in a wide flat <mark4>space,</mark4><br>
Uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend a lover near, <br>
I know very well I could <mark1>not.</mark1><br>
