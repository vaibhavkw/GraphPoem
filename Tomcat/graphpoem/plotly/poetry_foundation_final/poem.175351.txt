Title : In Cities, Be Alert <br>
Author : Annie Finch <br><br>

You may hear that your heartbeat is <mark4>uneven</mark4><br>
and let new tension climb around your <mark4>shoulders,</mark4><br>
thinking you've found the trick for going mad. <br>
But try to keep a grip on where you are. <br>
<br>
Remember: all around you is pure city; <br>
try to stay alert. On the wide <mark4>streets,</mark4><br>
so empty late at night, streaking in <mark4>glass,</mark4><br>
the color of an alley, or the fall <br>
<br>
of a sideways flicker from a neon <mark4>sign</mark4><br>
may utterly and briefly disconcert <mark3>you--</mark3><br>
but as you go, you'll find that noise is <mark4>worse.</mark4><br>
Prepare for noise. But never scream. Even tensing <br>
<br>
ears too far in advance can sharpen <mark4>sirens,</mark4><br>
and as for horns. ... When you're back <mark3>to</mark3><br>
your normal rhythm after such <mark4>encounters,</mark4><br>
<br>
just try to stay alert. You'll never know <br>
exactly who is coming up behind <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
but the sudden movement of <mark4>pedestrians</mark4><br>
will finally, of course, be what disarms <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
