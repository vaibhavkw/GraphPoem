Title : Paradise Lost: Book 3 (1674 version) <br>
Author : John Milton <br><br>

HAil holy Light, ofspring of Heav'n <mark4>first-born,</mark4><br>
Or of th' Eternal Coeternal <mark3>beam</mark3><br>
May I express thee unblam'd? since God is <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
And never but in unapproached <mark1>light</mark1><br>
Dwelt from Eternitie, dwelt then in <mark5>thee,</mark5><br>
Bright effluence of bright essence increate. <br>
Or hear'st thou rather pure Ethereal <mark3>stream,</mark3><br>
Whose Fountain who shall tell? before the <mark4>Sun,</mark4><br>
Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
Of God, as with a Mantle didst <mark4>invest</mark4><br>
The rising world of waters dark and <mark4>deep,</mark4><br>
Won from the void and formless <mark4>infinite.</mark4><br>
Thee I re-visit now with bolder <mark4>wing,</mark4><br>
Escap't the Stygian Pool, though long <mark4>detain'd</mark4><br>
In that obscure sojourn, while in my <mark4>flight</mark4><br>
Through utter and through middle darkness <mark4>borne</mark4><br>
With other notes then to th' Orphean <mark4>Lyre</mark4><br>
I sung of Chaos and Eternal <mark3>Night,</mark3><br>
Taught by the heav'nly Muse to venture <mark4>down</mark4><br>
The dark descent, and up to reascend, <br>
Though hard and rare: thee I revisit <mark4>safe,</mark4><br>
And feel thy sovran vital Lamp; but <mark3>thou</mark3><br>
Revisit'st not these eyes, that rowle in <mark4>vain</mark4><br>
To find thy piercing ray, and find no <mark4>dawn;</mark4><br>
So thick a drop serene hath quencht thir <mark5>Orbs,</mark5><br>
Or dim suffusion veild.   Yet not the <mark4>more</mark4><br>
Cease I to wander where the Muses <mark4>haunt</mark4><br>
Cleer Spring, or shadie Grove, or Sunnie <mark4>Hill,</mark4><br>
Smit with the love of sacred Song; but <mark4>chief</mark4><br>
Thee Sion and the flowrie Brooks <mark4>beneath</mark4><br>
That wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling <mark3>flow,</mark3><br>
Nightly I visit: nor somtimes <mark4>forget</mark4><br>
Those other two equal'd with me in <mark4>Fate,</mark4><br>
So were I equal'd with them in <mark4>renown,</mark4><br>
Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides, <br>
And Tiresias and Phineus Prophets <mark4>old.</mark4><br>
Then feed on thoughts, that voluntarie <mark4>move</mark4><br>
Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful <mark4>Bird</mark4><br>
Sings darkling, and in shadiest Covert <mark4>hid</mark4><br>
Tunes her nocturnal Note.   Thus with the <mark4>Year</mark4><br>
Seasons return, but not to me <mark4>returns</mark4><br>
Day, or the sweet approach of Ev'n or <mark4>Morn,</mark4><br>
Or sight of vernal bloom, or Summers <mark4>Rose,</mark4><br>
Or flocks, or heards, or human face <mark4>divine;</mark4><br>
But cloud in stead, and ever-during <mark4>dark</mark4><br>
Surrounds me, from the chearful wayes of <mark4>men</mark4><br>
Cut off, and for the Book of knowledg <mark4>fair</mark4><br>
Presented with a Universal <mark4>blanc</mark4><br>
Of Natures works to mee expung'd and <mark4>ras'd,</mark4><br>
And wisdome at one entrance quite shut <mark4>out.</mark4><br>
So much the rather thou Celestial <mark1>light</mark1><br>
Shine inward, and the mind through all her <mark4>powers</mark4><br>
Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from <mark4>thence</mark4><br>
Purge and disperse, that I may see and <mark4>tell</mark4><br>
Of things invisible to mortal <mark3>sight.</mark3><br>
<br>
Now had the Almighty Father from <mark4>above,</mark4><br>
From the pure Empyrean where he <mark4>sits</mark4><br>
High Thron'd above all highth, bent down his <mark3>eye,</mark3><br>
His own works and their works at once to <mark3>view:</mark3><br>
About him all the Sanctities of <mark4>Heaven</mark4><br>
Stood thick as Starrs, and from his sight <mark5>receiv'd</mark5><br>
Beatitude past utterance; on his <mark3>right</mark3><br>
The radiant image of his Glory <mark4>sat,</mark4><br>
His onely Son; On Earth he first <mark4>beheld</mark4><br>
Our two first Parents, yet the onely <mark3>two</mark3><br>
Of mankind, in the happie Garden <mark5>plac't,</mark5><br>
Reaping immortal fruits of joy and <mark3>love,</mark3><br>
Uninterrupted joy, unrivald <mark1>love</mark1><br>
In blissful solitude; he then <mark4>survey'd</mark4><br>
Hell and the Gulf between, and Satan <mark3>there</mark3><br>
Coasting the wall of Heav'n on this side <mark1>Night</mark1><br>
In the dun Air sublime, and ready <mark3>now</mark3><br>
To stoop with wearied wings, and willing <mark4>feet</mark4><br>
On the bare outside of this World, that <mark4>seem'd</mark4><br>
Firm land imbosom'd without <mark5>Firmament,</mark5><br>
Uncertain which, in Ocean or in <mark3>Air.</mark3><br>
Him God beholding from his prospect <mark3>high,</mark3><br>
Wherein past, present, future he <mark5>beholds,</mark5><br>
Thus to his onely Son foreseeing <mark4>spake.</mark4><br>
<br>
Onely begotten Son, seest thou what <mark4>rage</mark4><br>
Transports our adversarie, whom no <mark4>bounds</mark4><br>
Prescrib'd, no barrs of Hell, nor all the <mark4>chains</mark4><br>
Heapt on him there, nor yet the main <mark4>Abyss</mark4><br>
Wide interrupt can hold; so bent he <mark4>seems</mark4><br>
On desparate reveng, that shall <mark4>redound</mark4><br>
Upon his own rebellious head.   And <mark1>now</mark1><br>
Through all restraint broke loose he wings his <mark3>way</mark3><br>
Not farr off Heav'n, in the Precincts of <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
Directly towards the new created <mark4>World,</mark4><br>
And Man there plac't, with purpose to <mark5>assay</mark5><br>
If him by force he can destroy, or <mark4>worse,</mark4><br>
By some false guile <mark1>pervert</mark1>, and shall <mark4>pervert</mark4><br>
For man will hark'n to his glozing lyes, <br>
And easily transgress the sole <mark4>Command,</mark4><br>
Sole pledge of his obedience: So will <mark4>fall,</mark4><br>
Hee and his faithless Progenie: whose <mark4>fault?</mark4><br>
Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of <mark3>mee</mark3><br>
All he could have; I made him just and <mark1>right,</mark1><br>
Sufficient to have stood, though free to <mark1>fall.</mark1><br>
Such I created all th' Ethereal <mark1>Powers</mark1><br>
And Spirits, both them who stood and them who <mark5>faild;</mark5><br>
Freely they stood who stood, and fell who <mark4>fell.</mark4><br>
Not free, what proof could they have givn <mark4>sincere</mark4><br>
Of true allegiance, constant Faith or <mark1>Love,</mark1><br>
Where onely what they needs must do, <mark5>appeard,</mark5><br>
Not what they would? what praise could they <mark4>receive?</mark4><br>
What pleasure I from such obedience <mark4>paid,</mark4><br>
When Will and Reason (Reason also is <mark4>choice)</mark4><br>
Useless and vain, of freedom both <mark5>despoild,</mark5><br>
Made passive both, had servd <mark5>necessitie,</mark5><br>
Not mee.   They therefore as to right <mark5>belongd,</mark5><br>
So were created, nor can justly <mark4>accuse</mark4><br>
Thir maker, or thir making, or thir <mark1>Fate,</mark1><br>
As if predestination over-rul'd <br>
Thir will, dispos'd by absolute <mark3>Decree</mark3><br>
Or high foreknowledge; they themselves <mark4>decreed</mark4><br>
Thir own revolt, not I: if I <mark5>foreknew,</mark5><br>
Foreknowledge had no influence on their <mark1>fault,</mark1><br>
Which had no less prov'd certain unforeknown. <br>
So without least impulse or shadow of <mark1>Fate,</mark1><br>
Or aught by me immutablie <mark4>foreseen,</mark4><br>
They trespass, Authors to themselves in <mark4>all</mark4><br>
Both what they judge and what they choose; for <mark3>so</mark3><br>
I formd them free, and free they must <mark4>remain,</mark4><br>
Till they enthrall themselves: I else must <mark4>change</mark4><br>
Thir nature, and revoke the high <mark1>Decree</mark1><br>
Unchangeable, Eternal, which <mark4>ordain'd</mark4><br>
Thir freedom, they themselves ordain'd thir <mark1>fall.</mark1><br>
The first sort by thir own suggestion <mark1>fell,</mark1><br>
Self-tempted, self-deprav'd: Man falls <mark5>deceiv'd</mark5><br>
By the other first: Man therefore shall find <mark4>grace,</mark4><br>
The other none: in Mercy and Justice <mark4>both,</mark4><br>
Through Heav'n and Earth, so shall my glorie <mark3>excel,</mark3><br>
But Mercy first and last shall brightest <mark4>shine.</mark4><br>
<br>
Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance <mark4>fill'd</mark4><br>
All Heav'n, and in the blessed Spirits <mark4>elect</mark4><br>
Sense of new joy ineffable diffus'd: <br>
Beyond compare the Son of God was <mark4>seen</mark4><br>
Most glorious, in him all his Father <mark4>shon</mark4><br>
Substantially express'd, and in his <mark3>face</mark3><br>
Divine compassion visibly <mark5>appeerd,</mark5><br>
Love without end, and without measure <mark1>Grace,</mark1><br>
Which uttering thus he to his Father <mark1>spake.</mark1><br>
<br>
O Father, gracious was that word which <mark4>clos'd</mark4><br>
Thy sovran <mark4>sentence</mark4>, that Man should find <mark1>grace;</mark1><br>
For which both Heav'n and Earth shall high extoll <br>
Thy praises, with th' innumerable <mark4>sound</mark4><br>
Of Hymns and sacred Songs, wherewith thy <mark4>Throne</mark4><br>
Encompass'd shall resound thee ever <mark4>blest.</mark4><br>
For should Man finally be lost, should <mark4>Man</mark4><br>
Thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest <mark4>Son</mark4><br>
Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though <mark5>joynd</mark5><br>
With his own folly? that be from thee <mark4>farr,</mark4><br>
That farr be from thee, Father, who art Judg <br>
Of all things made, and judgest onely <mark1>right.</mark1><br>
Or shall the Adversarie thus <mark4>obtain</mark4><br>
His end, and frustrate thine, shall he <mark4>fulfill</mark4><br>
His malice, and thy goodness bring to <mark4>naught,</mark4><br>
Or proud return though to his heavier <mark4>doom,</mark4><br>
Yet with revenge accomplish't and to <mark4>Hell</mark4><br>
Draw after him the whole Race of <mark4>mankind,</mark4><br>
By him corrupted? or wilt thou thy <mark4>self</mark4><br>
Abolish thy Creation, and unmake, <br>
For him, what for thy glorie thou hast <mark4>made?</mark4><br>
So should thy goodness and thy greatness <mark1>both</mark1><br>
Be questiond and blaspheam'd without <mark4>defence.</mark4><br>
<br>
To whom the great Creatour thus <mark4>reply'd.</mark4><br>
O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief <mark4>delight,</mark4><br>
Son of my bosom, Son who art <mark4>alone</mark4><br>
My word, my wisdom, and effectual <mark3>might,</mark3><br>
All hast thou spok'n as my thoughts are, <mark1>all</mark1><br>
As my Eternal purpose hath <mark1>decreed:</mark1><br>
Man shall not quite be lost, but sav'd who <mark4>will,</mark4><br>
Yet not of will in him, but grace in <mark3>me</mark3><br>
Freely voutsaft; once more I will <mark3>renew</mark3><br>
His lapsed powers, though forfeit and <mark5>enthrall'd</mark5><br>
By sin to foul exorbitant <mark4>desires;</mark4><br>
Upheld by me, yet once more he shall <mark4>stand</mark4><br>
On even ground against his mortal <mark3>foe,</mark3><br>
By me upheld, that he may know how <mark4>frail</mark4><br>
His fall'n condition is, and to me <mark3>ow</mark3><br>
All his deliv'rance, and to none but <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
Some I have chosen of peculiar <mark1>grace</mark1><br>
Elect above the rest; so is my <mark1>will:</mark1><br>
The rest shall hear me call, and oft be <mark5>warnd</mark5><br>
Thir sinful state, and to appease betimes <br>
Th' incensed Deitie, while offerd <mark1>grace</mark1><br>
Invites; for I will cleer thir senses <mark1>dark,</mark1><br>
What may sufflce, and soft'n stonie <mark4>hearts</mark4><br>
To pray, repent, and bring obedience <mark3>due.</mark3><br>
To Prayer, repentance, and obedience <mark1>due,</mark1><br>
Though but endevord with sincere <mark4>intent,</mark4><br>
Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not <mark4>shut.</mark4><br>
And I will place within them as a <mark4>guide</mark4><br>
My Umpire Conscience, whom if they will <mark4>hear,</mark4><br>
Light after light well us'd they shall <mark4>attain,</mark4><br>
And to the end persisting, safe <mark4>arrive.</mark4><br>
This my long sufferance and my day of <mark1>grace</mark1><br>
They who neglect and scorn, shall never <mark4>taste;</mark4><br>
But hard be hard'nd, blind be blinded <mark1>more,</mark1><br>
That they may stumble on, and deeper <mark1>fall;</mark1><br>
And none but such from mercy I <mark4>exclude.</mark4><br>
But yet all is not don; Man <mark4>disobeying,</mark4><br>
Disloyal breaks his fealtie, and <mark5>sinns</mark5><br>
Against the high Supremacie of <mark5>Heav'n,</mark5><br>
Affecting God-head, and so loosing <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
To expiate his Treason hath naught <mark4>left,</mark4><br>
But to destruction sacred and <mark4>devote,</mark4><br>
He with his whole posteritie must <mark3>dye,</mark3><br>
Dye hee or Justice must; unless for <mark4>him</mark4><br>
Som other able, and as willing, <mark3>pay</mark3><br>
The rigid satisfaction, death for <mark4>death.</mark4><br>
Say Heav'nly powers, where shall we find such <mark1>love,</mark1><br>
Which of ye will be mortal to <mark4>redeem</mark4><br>
Mans mortal crime, and just th' unjust to <mark4>save,</mark4><br>
Dwels in all Heaven charitie so <mark5>deare?</mark5><br>
<br>
He ask'd, but all the Heav'nly Quire stood <mark4>mute,</mark4><br>
And silence was in Heav'n: on mans <mark4>behalf</mark4><br>
Patron or Intercessor none <mark1>appeerd,</mark1><br>
Much less that durst upon his own head <mark5>draw</mark5><br>
The deadly forfeiture, and ransom <mark4>set.</mark4><br>
And now without redemption all <mark1>mankind</mark1><br>
Must have bin lost, adjudg'd to Death and <mark1>Hell</mark1><br>
By doom severe, had not the Son of <mark4>God,</mark4><br>
In whom the fulness dwels of love <mark1>divine,</mark1><br>
His dearest mediation thus <mark5>renewd.</mark5><br>
<br>
Father, thy word is past, man shall find <mark1>grace;</mark1><br>
And shall grace not find means, that finds her <mark1>way,</mark1><br>
The speediest of thy winged <mark4>messengers,</mark4><br>
To visit all thy creatures, and to <mark1>all</mark1><br>
Comes unprevented, unimplor'd, <mark5>unsought,</mark5><br>
Happie for man, so coming; he her <mark4>aide</mark4><br>
Can never seek, once dead in sins and <mark4>lost;</mark4><br>
Attonement for himself or offering <mark4>meet,</mark4><br>
Indebted and undon, hath none to <mark4>bring:</mark4><br>
Behold mee then, mee for him, life for <mark4>life</mark4><br>
I offer, on mee let thine anger <mark1>fall;</mark1><br>
Account mee man; I for his sake will <mark4>leave</mark4><br>
Thy bosom, and this glorie next to <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
Freely put off, and for him lastly <mark1>dye</mark1><br>
Well pleas'd, on me let Death wreck all his <mark1>rage;</mark1><br>
Under his gloomie power I shall not <mark4>long</mark4><br>
Lie vanquisht; thou hast givn me to <mark4>possess</mark4><br>
Life in my self for ever, by thee I <mark4>live,</mark4><br>
Though now to Death I yield, and am his <mark1>due</mark1><br>
All that of me can die, yet that debt <mark1>paid,</mark1><br>
Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom <mark4>grave</mark4><br>
His prey, nor suffer my unspotted <mark4>Soule</mark4><br>
For ever with corruption there to <mark4>dwell;</mark4><br>
But I shall rise Victorious, and <mark3>subdue</mark3><br>
My vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile; <br>
Death his deaths wound shall then receive, and <mark4>stoop</mark4><br>
Inglorious, of his mortall sting <mark4>disarm'd.</mark4><br>
I through the ample Air in Triumph <mark1>high</mark1><br>
Shall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell, and <mark3>show</mark3><br>
The powers of darkness bound.   Thou at the <mark1>sight</mark1><br>
Pleas'd, out of Heaven shalt look down and <mark4>smile,</mark4><br>
While by thee rais'd I ruin all my <mark4>Foes,</mark4><br>
Death last, and with his Carcass glut the <mark1>Grave:</mark1><br>
Then with the multitude of my <mark5>redeemd</mark5><br>
Shall enter Heaven long absent, and <mark5>returne,</mark5><br>
Father, to see thy face, wherein no <mark4>cloud</mark4><br>
Of anger shall remain, but peace <mark5>assur'd,</mark5><br>
And reconcilement; wrauth shall be no <mark1>more</mark1><br>
Thenceforth, but in thy presence joy <mark5>entire.</mark5><br>
<br>
His words here ended, but his meek <mark4>aspect</mark4><br>
Silent yet spake, and breath'd immortal <mark1>love</mark1><br>
To mortal <mark4>men</mark4>, above which only <mark1>shon</mark1><br>
Filial obedience: as a <mark4>sacrifice</mark4><br>
Glad to be offer'd, he attends the <mark1>will</mark1><br>
Of his great Father.   Admiration <mark4>seis'd</mark4><br>
All Heav'n, what this might mean, and whither <mark4>tend</mark4><br>
Wondring; but soon th' Almighty thus <mark1>reply'd:</mark1><br>
<br>
O thou in Heav'n and Earth the only <mark4>peace</mark4><br>
Found out for mankind under wrauth, O <mark1>thou</mark1><br>
My sole complacence! well thou know'st how <mark4>dear,</mark4><br>
To me are all my works, nor Man the <mark4>least</mark4><br>
Though last created, that for him I <mark4>spare</mark4><br>
Thee from my bosom and right hand, to <mark1>save,</mark1><br>
By loosing thee a while, the whole Race <mark1>lost.</mark1><br>
Thou therefore whom thou only canst <mark1>redeem,</mark1><br>
Thir Nature also to thy Nature <mark5>joyn;</mark5><br>
And be thy self Man among men on <mark4>Earth,</mark4><br>
Made flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin <mark4>seed,</mark4><br>
By wondrous birth: Be thou in Adams <mark4>room</mark4><br>
The Head of all mankind, though Adams <mark1>Son.</mark1><br>
As in him perish all men, so in <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
As from a second root shall be <mark5>restor'd,</mark5><br>
As many as are restor'd, without thee <mark3>none.</mark3><br>
His crime makes guiltie all his Sons, thy <mark4>merit</mark4><br>
Imputed shall absolve them who <mark4>renounce</mark4><br>
Thir own both righteous and unrighteous <mark4>deeds,</mark4><br>
And live in thee transplanted, and from <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
Receive new life.   So Man, as is most <mark4>just,</mark4><br>
Shall satisfie for Man, be judg'd and <mark3>die,</mark3><br>
And dying <mark4>rise</mark4>, and rising with him <mark4>raise</mark4><br>
His Brethren, ransomd with his own dear <mark1>life.</mark1><br>
So Heav'nly love shall outdoo Hellish <mark4>hate</mark4><br>
Giving to death, and dying to <mark5>redeeme,</mark5><br>
So dearly to redeem what Hellish <mark1>hate</mark1><br>
So easily destroy'd, and still <mark5>destroyes</mark5><br>
In those who, when they may, accept not <mark1>grace.</mark1><br>
Nor shalt thou by descending to <mark3>assume</mark3><br>
Mans Nature, less'n or degrade thine owne. <br>
Because thou hast, though Thron'd in highest <mark4>bliss</mark4><br>
Equal to God, and equally <mark4>enjoying</mark4><br>
God-like fruition, quitted all to <mark1>save</mark1><br>
A World from utter loss, and hast been <mark4>found</mark4><br>
By Merit more then Birthright Son of <mark1>God,</mark1><br>
Found worthiest to be so by being <mark4>Good,</mark4><br>
Farr more then Great or High; because in <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
Love hath abounded more then Glory <mark4>abounds,</mark4><br>
Therefore thy Humiliation shall <mark4>exalt</mark4><br>
With thee thy Manhood also to this <mark1>Throne;</mark1><br>
Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt <mark4>Reign</mark4><br>
Both God and <mark1>Man</mark1>, Son both of God and <mark1>Man,</mark1><br>
Anointed universal King, all <mark4>Power</mark4><br>
I give thee, reign for ever, and <mark1>assume</mark1><br>
Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supream <br>
Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I <mark4>reduce:</mark4><br>
All knees to thee shall bow, of them that <mark4>bide</mark4><br>
In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in <mark1>Hell;</mark1><br>
When thou attended gloriously from <mark1>Heav'n</mark1><br>
Shalt in the Sky appeer, and from thee <mark4>send</mark4><br>
The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime <br>
Thy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all <mark4>Windes</mark4><br>
The living, and forthwith the cited <mark4>dead</mark4><br>
Of all past Ages to the general <mark1>Doom</mark1><br>
Shall hast'n, such a peal shall rouse thir <mark4>sleep.</mark4><br>
Then all thy Saints assembl'd, thou shalt <mark4>judge</mark4><br>
Bad men and Angels, they arraignd shall <mark4>sink</mark4><br>
Beneath thy Sentence; <mark4>Hell</mark4>, her numbers <mark4>full,</mark4><br>
Thenceforth shall be for ever shut.   Mean <mark4>while</mark4><br>
The World shall burn, and from her ashes <mark4>spring</mark4><br>
New Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall <mark1>dwell,</mark1><br>
And after all thir tribulations <mark1>long</mark1><br>
See golden <mark4>days</mark4>, fruitful of golden <mark1>deeds,</mark1><br>
With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair <mark4>Truth.</mark4><br>
Then thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay <mark3>by,</mark3><br>
For regal Scepter then no more shall <mark4>need,</mark4><br>
God shall be All in All.   But all ye <mark4>Gods,</mark4><br>
Adore him, who to compass all this <mark4>dies,</mark4><br>
Adore the Son, and honour him as <mark1>mee.</mark1><br>
<br>
No sooner had th' Almighty ceas't, but <mark1>all</mark1><br>
The multitude of Angels with a <mark4>shout</mark4><br>
Loud as from numbers without number, <mark4>sweet</mark4><br>
As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav'n <mark4>rung</mark4><br>
With Jubilee, and loud Hosanna's <mark5>filld</mark5><br>
Th' eternal Regions: lowly <mark4>reverent</mark4><br>
Towards either Throne they bow, and to the <mark4>ground</mark4><br>
With solemn adoration down they <mark4>cast</mark4><br>
Thir Crowns inwove with Amarant and <mark4>Gold,</mark4><br>
Immortal Amarant, a Flour which <mark4>once</mark4><br>
In Paradise, fast by the Tree of <mark1>Life</mark1><br>
Began to bloom, but soon for mans <mark5>offence</mark5><br>
To Heav'n remov'd where first it grew, there <mark4>grows,</mark4><br>
And flours aloft shading the Fount of <mark1>Life,</mark1><br>
And where the river of Bliss through midst of <mark5>Heavn</mark5><br>
Rowls o're Elisian Flours her Amber <mark1>stream;</mark1><br>
With these that never fade the Spirits <mark1>elect</mark1><br>
Bind thir resplendent locks inwreath'd with <mark4>beams,</mark4><br>
Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the <mark4>bright</mark4><br>
Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper <mark1>shon</mark1><br>
Impurpl'd with Celestial Roses <mark5>smil'd.</mark5><br>
Then Crown'd again thir gold'n Harps they <mark4>took,</mark4><br>
Harps ever tun'd, that glittering by thir <mark4>side</mark4><br>
Like Quivers hung, and with Praeamble <mark1>sweet</mark1><br>
Of charming symphonie they <mark4>introduce</mark4><br>
Thir sacred Song, and waken raptures <mark1>high;</mark1><br>
No voice exempt, no voice but well could joine <br>
Melodious part, such concord is in <mark1>Heav'n.</mark1><br>
<br>
Thee Father first they sung <mark4>Omnipotent,</mark4><br>
Immutable, Immortal, <mark1>Infinite,</mark1><br>
Eternal <mark4>King</mark4>, thee Author of all <mark4>being,</mark4><br>
Fountain of Light, thy self <mark4>invisible</mark4><br>
Amidst the glorious brightness where thou <mark4>sit'st</mark4><br>
Thron'd inaccessible, but when thou <mark4>shad'st</mark4><br>
The full blaze of thy beams, and through a <mark1>cloud</mark1><br>
Drawn round about thee like a radiant <mark4>Shrine,</mark4><br>
Dark with excessive bright thy skirts <mark5>appeer,</mark5><br>
Yet dazle Heav'n, that brightest <mark3>Seraphim</mark3><br>
Approach not, but with both wings veil thir <mark4>eyes.</mark4><br>
Thee next they sang of all Creation <mark4>first,</mark4><br>
Begotten Son, Divine Similitude, <br>
In whose conspicuous count'nance, without <mark1>cloud</mark1><br>
Made visible, th' Almighty Father <mark4>shines,</mark4><br>
Whom else no Creature can behold; on <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie <mark4>abides,</mark4><br>
Transfus'd on thee his ample Spirit <mark4>rests.</mark4><br>
Hee Heav'n of Heavens and all the Powers <mark4>therein</mark4><br>
By thee created, and by thee threw <mark1>down</mark1><br>
Th' aspiring Dominations: thou that <mark3>day</mark3><br>
Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not <mark1>spare,</mark1><br>
Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that <mark3>shook</mark3><br>
Heav'ns everlasting Frame, while o're the <mark4>necks</mark4><br>
Thou drov'st of warring Angels <mark5>disarraid.</mark5><br>
Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud <mark5>acclaime</mark5><br>
Thee only extoll'd, Son of thy Fathers <mark1>might,</mark1><br>
To execute fierce vengeance on his <mark1>foes,</mark1><br>
Not so on Man; him through their malice <mark4>fall'n,</mark4><br>
Father of Mercie and Grace, thou didst not <mark5>doome</mark5><br>
So strictly, but much more to pitie <mark5>encline:</mark5><br>
No sooner did thy dear and onely <mark1>Son</mark1><br>
Perceive thee purpos'd not to doom frail <mark1>Man</mark1><br>
So strictly, but much more to pitie <mark5>enclin'd,</mark5><br>
He to appease thy wrauth, and end the <mark3>strife</mark3><br>
Of Mercy and justice in thy face <mark4>discern'd,</mark4><br>
Regardless of the Bliss wherein hee <mark1>sat</mark1><br>
Second to thee, offerd himself to <mark1>die</mark1><br>
For mans offence.   O unexampl'd <mark1>love,</mark1><br>
Love no where to be found less then <mark1>Divine!</mark1><br>
Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy <mark4>Name</mark4><br>
Shall be the copious matter of my <mark4>Song</mark4><br>
Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy <mark4>praise</mark4><br>
Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise <mark5>disjoine.</mark5><br>
<br>
Thus they in Heav'n, above the starry Sphear, <br>
Thir happie hours in joy and hymning <mark4>spent.</mark4><br>
Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe <br>
Of this round World, whose first convex <mark4>divides</mark4><br>
The luminous inferior Orbs, <mark5>enclos'd</mark5><br>
From Chaos and th' inroad of Darkness <mark1>old,</mark1><br>
Satan alighted walks: a Globe farr <mark4>off</mark4><br>
It seem'd, now seems a boundless <mark4>Continent</mark4><br>
Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of <mark1>Night</mark1><br>
Starless <mark4>expos'd</mark4>, and ever-threatning <mark4>storms</mark4><br>
Of Chaos blustring round, inclement <mark1>skie;</mark1><br>
Save on that side which from the wall of <mark1>Heav'n</mark1><br>
Though distant farr som small reflection <mark4>gaines</mark4><br>
Of glimmering air less vext with tempest <mark4>loud:</mark4><br>
Here walk'd the Fiend at large in spacious <mark4>field.</mark4><br>
As when a Vultur on Imaus <mark4>bred,</mark4><br>
Whose snowie ridge the roving Tartar <mark1>bounds,</mark1><br>
Dislodging from a Region scarce of <mark3>prey</mark3><br>
To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling <mark4>Kids</mark4><br>
On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the <mark4>Springs</mark4><br>
Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian <mark4>streams;</mark4><br>
But in his way lights on the barren <mark4>Plaines</mark4><br>
Of Sericana, where Chineses <mark4>drive</mark4><br>
With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons <mark1>light:</mark1><br>
So on this windie Sea of <mark4>Land</mark4>, the <mark4>Fiend</mark4><br>
Walk'd up and down alone bent on his <mark1>prey,</mark1><br>
Alone, for other Creature in this <mark4>place</mark4><br>
Living or liveless to be found was <mark1>none,</mark1><br>
None yet, but store hereafter from the <mark1>earth</mark1><br>
Up hither like Aereal vapours <mark3>flew</mark3><br>
Of all things transitorie and <mark4>vain</mark4>, when <mark4>Sin</mark4><br>
With vanity had filld the works of <mark1>men:</mark1><br>
Both all things vain, and all who in vain <mark4>things</mark4><br>
Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting <mark3>fame,</mark3><br>
Or happiness in this or th' other <mark1>life;</mark1><br>
All who have thir reward on Earth, the <mark4>fruits</mark4><br>
Of painful Superstition and blind <mark4>Zeal,</mark4><br>
Naught seeking but the praise of men, here <mark4>find</mark4><br>
Fit retribution, emptie as thir <mark1>deeds;</mark1><br>
All th, unaccomplisht works of Natures <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly <mark1>mixt,</mark1><br>
Dissolvd on Earth, fleet hither, and in <mark1>vain,</mark1><br>
Till final dissolution, wander <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd; <br>
Those argent Fields more likely habitants, <br>
Translated Saints, or middle Spirits <mark4>hold</mark4><br>
Betwixt th' Angelical and Human kinde: <br>
Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters <mark4>born</mark4><br>
First from the ancient World those Giants <mark3>came</mark3><br>
With many a vain exploit, though then <mark5>renownd:</mark5><br>
The builders next of Babel on the <mark4>Plain</mark4><br>
Of Sennaar, and still with vain <mark5>designe</mark5><br>
New Babels, had they wherewithall, would <mark4>build:</mark4><br>
Others came single; he who to be <mark5>deemd</mark5><br>
A God, leap'd fondly into Aetna <mark4>flames,</mark4><br>
Empedocles, and hee who to <mark5>enjoy</mark5><br>
Plato's Elysium, leap'd into the <mark3>Sea,</mark3><br>
Cleombrotus, and many more too <mark1>long,</mark1><br>
Embryo's and Idiots, Eremits and Friers <br>
White, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie. <br>
Here Pilgrims roam, that stray'd so farr to <mark4>seek</mark4><br>
In Golgotha him dead, who lives in <mark1>Heav'n;</mark1><br>
And they who to be sure of <mark4>Paradise</mark4><br>
Dying put on the weeds of <mark4>Dominic,</mark4><br>
Or in Franciscan think to pass <mark5>disguis'd;</mark5><br>
They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt, <br>
And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance <mark4>weighs</mark4><br>
The Trepidation talkt, and that first <mark5>mov'd;</mark5><br>
And now Saint Peter at Heav'ns Wicket <mark1>seems</mark1><br>
To wait them with his Keys, and now at <mark4>foot</mark4><br>
Of Heav'ns ascent they lift thir Feet, when <mark3>loe</mark3><br>
A violent cross wind from either <mark4>Coast</mark4><br>
Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues <mark3>awry</mark3><br>
Into the devious Air; then might ye <mark2>see</mark2><br>
Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost <br>
And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, <mark4>Beads,</mark4><br>
Indulgences, Dispenses, <mark4>Pardons</mark4>, <mark4>Bulls,</mark4><br>
The sport of Winds: all these upwhirld <mark4>aloft</mark4><br>
Fly o're the backside of the World farr <mark1>off</mark1><br>
Into a Limbo large and broad, since calld <br>
The Paradise of Fools, to few <mark4>unknown</mark4><br>
Long after, now unpeopl'd, and untrod; <br>
All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he <mark4>pass'd,</mark4><br>
And long he wanderd, till at last a gleame <br>
Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in <mark4>haste</mark4><br>
His travell'd steps; farr distant he <mark5>descries</mark5><br>
Ascending by degrees <mark4>magnificent</mark4><br>
Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure <mark1>high,</mark1><br>
At top whereof, but farr more rich <mark1>appeerd</mark1><br>
The work as of a Kingly Palace <mark4>Gate</mark4><br>
With Frontispice of Diamond and <mark1>Gold</mark1><br>
Imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes <br>
The Portal shon, inimitable on <mark1>Earth</mark1><br>
By Model, or by shading Pencil <mark4>drawn.</mark4><br>
The Stairs were such as whereon Jacob <mark3>saw</mark3><br>
Angels ascending and descending, <mark4>bands</mark4><br>
Of Guardians bright, when he from Esau <mark4>fled</mark4><br>
To Padan-Aram in the field of <mark4>Luz,</mark4><br>
Dreaming by night under the open <mark1>Skie,</mark1><br>
And waking cri'd, This is the Gate of <mark1>Heav'n.</mark1><br>
Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor <mark4>stood</mark4><br>
There alwayes, but drawn up to Heav'n somtimes <br>
Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea <mark4>flow'd</mark4><br>
Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearle, <mark5>whereon</mark5><br>
Who after came from Earth, sayling <mark5>arriv'd,</mark5><br>
Wafted by Angels, or flew o're the <mark4>Lake</mark4><br>
Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery <mark4>Steeds.</mark4><br>
The Stairs were then let down, whether to <mark4>dare</mark4><br>
The Fiend by easie <mark4>ascent</mark4>, or <mark4>aggravate</mark4><br>
His sad exclusion from the dores of <mark1>Bliss.</mark1><br>
Direct against which op'nd from <mark1>beneath,</mark1><br>
Just o're the blissful seat of <mark1>Paradise,</mark1><br>
A passage down to th' Earth, a passage <mark4>wide,</mark4><br>
Wider by farr then that of <mark4>after-times</mark4><br>
Over Mount Sion, and, though that were <mark4>large,</mark4><br>
Over the Promis'd Land to God so <mark1>dear,</mark1><br>
By which, to visit oft those happy <mark4>Tribes,</mark4><br>
On high behests his Angels to and <mark3>fro</mark3><br>
Pass'd frequent, and his eye with choice <mark4>regard</mark4><br>
From Paneas the fount of Jordans <mark4>flood</mark4><br>
To Beersaba, where the Holy <mark4>Land</mark4><br>
Borders on Aegypt and the Arabian <mark5>shoare;</mark5><br>
So wide the op'ning seemd, where bounds were <mark1>set</mark1><br>
To darkness, such as bound the Ocean <mark4>wave.</mark4><br>
Satan from hence now on the lower <mark4>stair</mark4><br>
That scal'd by steps of Gold to Heav'n <mark1>Gate</mark1><br>
Looks down with wonder at the sudden <mark1>view</mark1><br>
Of all this World at once.   As when a <mark4>Scout</mark4><br>
Through dark and desart wayes with peril <mark3>gone</mark3><br>
All night; at last by break of chearful <mark5>dawne</mark5><br>
Obtains the brow of some high-climbing <mark1>Hill,</mark1><br>
Which to his eye discovers <mark3>unaware</mark3><br>
The goodly prospect of some forein <mark1>land</mark1><br>
First-seen, or some renown'd <mark4>Metropolis</mark4><br>
With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd, <br>
Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his <mark1>beams.</mark1><br>
Such wonder seis'd, though after Heaven <mark1>seen,</mark1><br>
The Spirit maligne, but much more envy <mark1>seis'd</mark1><br>
At sight of all this World beheld so <mark3>faire.</mark3><br>
Round he surveys, and well might, where he <mark1>stood</mark1><br>
So high above the circling Canopie <br>
Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern <mark4>Point</mark4><br>
Of Libra to the fleecie Starr that <mark4>bears</mark4><br>
Andromeda farr off Atlantic <mark4>Seas</mark4><br>
Beyond th' Horizon; then from Pole to <mark4>Pole</mark4><br>
He views in bredth, and without longer <mark4>pause</mark4><br>
Down right into the Worlds first Region <mark4>throws</mark4><br>
His flight precipitant, and windes with <mark4>ease</mark4><br>
Through the pure marble Air his oblique <mark1>way</mark1><br>
Amongst innumerable Starrs, that <mark1>shon</mark1><br>
Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other <mark4>Worlds,</mark4><br>
Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy <mark4>Iles,</mark4><br>
Like those Hesperian Gardens fam'd of <mark1>old,</mark1><br>
Fortunate <mark4>Fields</mark4>, and Groves and flourie <mark4>Vales,</mark4><br>
Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy <mark1>there</mark1><br>
He stayd not to enquire: above them <mark1>all</mark1><br>
The golden Sun in splendor likest <mark1>Heaven</mark1><br>
Allur'd his eye: Thither his course he <mark4>bends</mark4><br>
Through the calm Firmament; but up or <mark4>downe</mark4><br>
By center, or eccentric, hard to <mark1>tell,</mark1><br>
Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie <br>
Alooff the vulgar Constellations <mark4>thick,</mark4><br>
That from his Lordly eye keep distance <mark1>due,</mark1><br>
Dispenses Light from farr; they as they <mark1>move</mark1><br>
Thir Starry dance in numbers that <mark4>compute</mark4><br>
Days, months, & years, towards his all-chearing <mark4>Lamp</mark4><br>
Turn swift thir various motions, or are <mark1>turnd</mark1><br>
By his Magnetic beam, that gently <mark4>warms</mark4><br>
The Univers, and to each inward <mark4>part</mark4><br>
With gentle <mark4>penetration</mark4>, though <mark4>unseen,</mark4><br>
Shoots invisible vertue even to the <mark1>deep:</mark1><br>
So wondrously was set his Station <mark1>bright.</mark1><br>
There lands the Fiend, a spot like which <mark4>perhaps</mark4><br>
Astronomer in the Sun's lucent <mark5>Orbe</mark5><br>
Through his glaz'd Optic Tube yet never <mark1>saw.</mark1><br>
The place he found beyond expression <mark1>bright,</mark1><br>
Compar'd with aught on Earth, Medal or <mark4>Stone;</mark4><br>
Not all parts like, but all alike <mark5>informd</mark5><br>
With radiant light, as glowing Iron with <mark4>fire;</mark4><br>
If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer; <br>
If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite, <br>
Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that <mark1>shon</mark1><br>
In Aarons Brest-plate, and a stone <mark4>besides</mark4><br>
Imagind rather oft then elsewhere <mark1>seen,</mark1><br>
That stone, or like to that which here <mark3>below</mark3><br>
Philosophers in vain so long have <mark4>sought,</mark4><br>
In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde <br>
Volatil Hermes, and call up <mark4>unbound</mark4><br>
In various shapes old Proteus from the <mark1>Sea,</mark1><br>
Draind through a Limbec to his Native <mark5>forme.</mark5><br>
What wonder then if fields and regions <mark1>here</mark1><br>
Breathe forth Elixir pure, and Rivers <mark4>run</mark4><br>
Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch <br>
Th' Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us <mark4>remote</mark4><br>
Produces with Terrestrial Humor <mark1>mixt</mark1><br>
Here in the dark so many precious <mark1>things</mark1><br>
Of colour glorious and effect so <mark4>rare?</mark4><br>
Here matter new to gaze the Devil <mark4>met</mark4><br>
Undazl'd, farr and wide his eye <mark4>commands,</mark4><br>
For sight no obstacle found here, nor <mark4>shade,</mark4><br>
But all <mark4>Sun-shine</mark4>, as when his Beams at <mark4>Noon</mark4><br>
Culminate from th' Aequator, as they <mark1>now</mark1><br>
Shot upward still direct, whence no way <mark4>round</mark4><br>
Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the <mark5>Aire,</mark5><br>
No where so cleer, sharp'nd his visual <mark3>ray</mark3><br>
To objects distant farr, whereby he <mark3>soon</mark3><br>
Saw within kenn a glorious Angel <mark1>stand,</mark1><br>
The same whom John saw also in the <mark1>Sun:</mark1><br>
His back was turnd, but not his brightness <mark1>hid;</mark1><br>
Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar <br>
Circl'd his <mark4>Head</mark4>, nor less his Locks <mark4>behind</mark4><br>
Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with <mark4>wings</mark4><br>
Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy'd <br>
He seemd, or fixt in cogitation <mark1>deep.</mark1><br>
Glad was the Spirit impure as now in <mark4>hope</mark4><br>
To find who might direct his wandring <mark1>flight</mark1><br>
To Paradise the happie seat of <mark1>Man,</mark1><br>
His journies end and our beginning <mark3>woe.</mark3><br>
But first he casts to change his proper <mark4>shape,</mark4><br>
Which else might work him danger or <mark3>delay:</mark3><br>
And now a stripling Cherube he <mark5>appeers,</mark5><br>
Not of the prime, yet such as in his <mark1>face</mark1><br>
Youth smil'd Celestial, and to every <mark4>Limb</mark4><br>
Sutable grace diffus'd, so well he feignd; <br>
Under a Coronet his flowing <mark3>haire</mark3><br>
In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he <mark4>wore</mark4><br>
Of many a colourd plume sprinkl'd with <mark1>Gold,</mark1><br>
His habit fit for speed succinct, and <mark4>held</mark4><br>
Before his decent steps a Silver <mark4>wand.</mark4><br>
He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel <mark1>bright,</mark1><br>
Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage <mark1>turnd,</mark1><br>
Admonisht by his ear, and strait was <mark4>known</mark4><br>
Th' Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seav'n <br>
Who in Gods presence, neerest to his <mark1>Throne</mark1><br>
Stand ready at command, and are his <mark1>Eyes</mark1><br>
That run through all the Heav'ns, or down to th' <mark1>Earth</mark1><br>
Bear his swift errands over moist and <mark3>dry,</mark3><br>
O're Sea and Land: him Satan thus <mark5>accostes;</mark5><br>
<br>
Uriel, for thou of those seav'n Spirits that <mark1>stand</mark1><br>
In sight of God's high Throne, gloriously <mark1>bright,</mark1><br>
The first art wont his great authentic <mark1>will</mark1><br>
Interpreter through highest Heav'n to <mark1>bring,</mark1><br>
Where all his Sons thy Embassie <mark4>attend;</mark4><br>
And here art likeliest by supream <mark1>decree</mark1><br>
Like honour to obtain, and as his <mark1>Eye</mark1><br>
To visit oft this new Creation <mark1>round;</mark1><br>
Unspeakable desire to see, and <mark3>know</mark3><br>
All these his wondrous works, but chiefly <mark1>Man,</mark1><br>
His chief delight and favour, him for <mark4>whom</mark4><br>
All these his works so wondrous he <mark5>ordaind,</mark5><br>
Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim <br>
Alone thus wandring.   Brightest Seraph <mark1>tell</mark1><br>
In which of all these shining Orbes hath <mark1>Man</mark1><br>
His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath <mark1>none,</mark1><br>
But all these shining Orbes his choice to <mark1>dwell;</mark1><br>
That I may find him, and with secret <mark4>gaze,</mark4><br>
Or open admiration him <mark4>behold</mark4><br>
On whom the great Creator hath <mark5>bestowd</mark5><br>
Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces <mark5>powrd;</mark5><br>
That both in him and all things, as is <mark1>meet,</mark1><br>
The Universal Maker we may <mark1>praise;</mark1><br>
Who justly hath drivn out his Rebell <mark1>Foes</mark1><br>
To deepest Hell, and to repair that <mark4>loss</mark4><br>
Created this new happie Race of <mark1>Men</mark1><br>
To serve him better: wise are all his <mark5>wayes.</mark5><br>
<br>
So spake the false dissembler unperceivd; <br>
For neither Man nor Angel can <mark4>discern</mark4><br>
Hypocrisie, the onely evil that <mark4>walks</mark4><br>
Invisible, except to God <mark1>alone,</mark1><br>
By his permissive will, through Heav'n and <mark1>Earth:</mark1><br>
And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion <mark4>sleeps</mark4><br>
At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie <br>
Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no <mark4>ill</mark4><br>
Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil'd <br>
Uriel, though Regent of the Sun, and <mark1>held</mark1><br>
The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in <mark1>Heav'n;</mark1><br>
Who to the fraudulent Impostor <mark5>foule</mark5><br>
In his uprightness answer thus <mark5>returnd.</mark5><br>
Fair Angel, thy desire which tends to <mark1>know</mark1><br>
The works of God, thereby to glorifie <br>
The great Work-Maister, leads to no <mark4>excess</mark4><br>
That reaches blame, but rather merits <mark1>praise</mark1><br>
The more it seems excess, that led thee <mark4>hither</mark4><br>
From thy Empyreal Mansion thus <mark1>alone,</mark1><br>
To witness with thine eyes what some <mark1>perhaps</mark1><br>
Contented with report hear onely in <mark1>heav'n:</mark1><br>
For wonderful indeed are all his <mark4>works,</mark4><br>
Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be <mark1>all</mark1><br>
Had in remembrance alwayes with <mark1>delight;</mark1><br>
But what created mind can <mark4>comprehend</mark4><br>
Thir number, or the wisdom <mark1>infinite</mark1><br>
That brought them forth, but hid thir causes <mark1>deep.</mark1><br>
I saw when at his Word the formless <mark4>Mass,</mark4><br>
This worlds material mould, came to a <mark3>heap:</mark3><br>
Confusion heard his voice, and wilde <mark4>uproar</mark4><br>
Stood rul'd, stood vast infinitude confin'd; <br>
Till at his second bidding darkness <mark1>fled,</mark1><br>
Light shon, and order from disorder <mark4>sprung:</mark4><br>
Swift to thir several Quarters hasted <mark4>then</mark4><br>
The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, <mark1>Fire,</mark1><br>
And this Ethereal quintessence of <mark1>Heav'n</mark1><br>
Flew upward, spirited with various <mark4>forms,</mark4><br>
That rowld orbicular, and turnd to <mark4>Starrs</mark4><br>
Numberless, as thou seest, and how they <mark1>move;</mark1><br>
Each had his place appointed, each his <mark4>course,</mark4><br>
The rest in circuit walles this <mark4>Universe.</mark4><br>
Look downward on that Globe whose hither <mark1>side</mark1><br>
With light from hence, though but reflected, <mark1>shines;</mark1><br>
That place is Earth the seat of Man, that <mark1>light</mark1><br>
His day, which else as th' other <mark4>Hemisphere</mark4><br>
Night would invade, but there the neighbouring <mark4>Moon</mark4><br>
(So call that opposite fair Starr) her <mark1>aide</mark1><br>
Timely interposes, and her monthly <mark1>round</mark1><br>
Still ending, still renewing, through mid <mark1>Heav'n;</mark1><br>
With borrowd light her countenance triform <br>
Hence fills and empties to enlighten th' <mark1>Earth,</mark1><br>
And in her pale dominion checks the <mark1>night.</mark1><br>
That spot to which I point is <mark1>Paradise,</mark1><br>
Adams abode, those loftie shades his Bowre. <br>
Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine <mark4>requires.</mark4><br>
<br>
Thus said, he turnd, and Satan bowing <mark3>low,</mark3><br>
As to superior Spirits is wont in <mark1>Heaven,</mark1><br>
Where honour due and reverence none <mark4>neglects,</mark4><br>
Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth <mark1>beneath,</mark1><br>
Down from th' Ecliptic, sped with hop'd <mark4>success,</mark4><br>
Throws his steep flight in many an Aerie <mark5>wheele,</mark5><br>
Nor staid, till on Niphates top he <mark4>lights.</mark4><br>
