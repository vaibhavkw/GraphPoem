Title : The Snow-Storm <br>
Author : Ralph Waldo Emerson <br><br>

Announced by all the trumpets of the sky, <br>
Arrives the snow, and, driving o'er the <mark4>fields,</mark4><br>
Seems nowhere to alight: the whited <mark4>air</mark4><br>
Hides hills and woods, the river, and the <mark4>heaven,</mark4><br>
And veils the farm-house at the garden's <mark4>end.</mark4><br>
The sled and traveller <mark4>stopped</mark4>, the courier's <mark4>feet</mark4><br>
Delayed, all friends shut <mark4>out</mark4>, the housemates <mark4>sit</mark4><br>
Around the radiant fireplace, <mark4>enclosed</mark4><br>
In a tumultuous privacy of <mark5>storm.</mark5><br>
<br>
Come see the north wind's masonry. <br>
Out of an unseen quarry <mark4>evermore</mark4><br>
Furnished with tile, the fierce artificer <br>
Curves his white bastions with projected roof <br>
Round every windward stake, or tree, or <mark4>door.</mark4><br>
Speeding, the myriad-handed, his wild <mark1>work</mark1><br>
So fanciful, so savage, nought cares he <br>
For number or proportion. Mockingly, <br>
On coop or kennel he hangs Parian <mark4>wreaths;</mark4><br>
A swan-like form invests the hidden <mark4>thorn;</mark4><br>
Fills up the farmer's lane from wall to wall, <br>
Maugre the farmer's sighs; and, at the <mark4>gate,</mark4><br>
A tapering turret overtops the <mark1>work.</mark1><br>
And when his hours are <mark4>numbered</mark4>, and the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
Is all his own, retiring, as he were <mark4>not,</mark4><br>
Leaves, when the sun appears, astonished <mark4>Art</mark4><br>
To mimic in slow structures, stone by <mark4>stone,</mark4><br>
Built in an age, the mad wind's <mark3>night-work,</mark3><br>
The frolic architecture of the snow. <br>
