Title : The Tree <br>
Author : Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea <br><br>

<br>
Fair tree! for thy delightful <mark3>shade</mark3><br>
'Tis just that some return be <mark3>made;</mark3><br>
Sure some return is due from <mark3>me</mark3><br>
To thy cool shadows, and to <mark3>thee.</mark3><br>
When thou to birds dost shelter <mark4>give,</mark4><br>
Thou music dost from them <mark4>receive;</mark4><br>
If travellers beneath thee <mark3>stay</mark3><br>
Till storms have worn themselves <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
That time in praising thee they <mark4>spend</mark4><br>
And thy protecting pow'r <mark3>commend.</mark3><br>
The shepherd here, from scorching <mark4>freed,</mark4><br>
Tunes to thy dancing leaves his <mark3>reed;</mark3><br>
Whilst his lov'd nymph, in thanks, <mark4>bestows</mark4><br>
Her flow'ry chaplets on thy <mark4>boughs.</mark4><br>
Shall I then only silent <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
And no return be made by <mark1>me?</mark1><br>
No; let this wish upon thee <mark3>wait,</mark3><br>
And still to flourish be thy <mark3>fate.</mark3><br>
To future ages may'st thou <mark4>stand</mark4><br>
Untouch'd by the rash workman's <mark3>hand,</mark3><br>
Till that large stock of sap is <mark4>spent,</mark4><br>
Which gives thy summer's <mark4>ornament;</mark4><br>
Till the fierce winds, that vainly <mark4>strive</mark4><br>
To shock thy greatness whilst <mark3>alive,</mark3><br>
Shall on thy lifeless hour <mark4>attend,</mark4><br>
Prevent the axe, and grace thy <mark3>end;</mark3><br>
Their scatter'd strength together <mark3>call</mark3><br>
And to the clouds proclaim thy <mark3>fall;</mark3><br>
Who then their ev'ning dews may <mark3>spare</mark3><br>
When thou no longer art their <mark3>care,</mark3><br>
But shalt, like ancient heroes, <mark3>burn,</mark3><br>
And some bright hearth be made thy <mark3>urn.</mark3><br>
