Title : I Know, I Remember, But How Can I Help You <br>
Author : Hayden Carruth <br><br>

The northern lights.         I wouldn't have noticed <mark4>them</mark4><br>
if the deer hadn't told <mark3>me</mark3><br>
a doe         her coat of pearls         her glowing <mark4>hoofs</mark4><br>
                      proud and inquisitive <br>
eager for my <mark4>appraisal</mark4><br>
and I went out into the night with electrical <mark4>steps</mark4><br>
but with my head held also <mark4>proud</mark4><br>
to share the animal's <mark4>fear</mark4><br>
and see what I had seen <mark4>before</mark4><br>
a sky flaring and <mark4>spectral</mark4><br>
greenish waves and <mark4>ribbons</mark4><br>
and the snow         under strange light         tossing in the <mark4>pasture</mark4><br>
like a storming ocean <mark4>caught</mark4><br>
by a flaring <mark4>beacon.</mark4><br>
The deer stands away from me         not <mark4>far</mark4><br>
there among bare black apple <mark4>trees</mark4><br>
a presence I no longer <mark3>see.</mark3><br>
We are proud to be <mark4>afraid</mark4><br>
proud to <mark4>share</mark4><br>
the silent magnetic storm that destroys the <mark4>stars</mark4><br>
and flickers around our <mark4>heads</mark4><br>
like the saints' cold spiritual <mark4>agonies</mark4><br>
of <mark4>old.</mark4><br>
I remember         but without the sense         other <mark4>light-storms</mark4><br>
cold memories discursive and <mark4>philosophical</mark4><br>
in my mind's <mark4>burden</mark4><br>
    and the deer remembers nothing. <br>
We move our feet         crunching bitter snow         while the <mark4>storm</mark4><br>
crashes like god-wars down the <mark4>east</mark4><br>
we shake the sparks from our <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
    we quiver inside our shocked fur <br>
we search for each <mark4>other</mark4><br>
in the apple <mark4>thicket--</mark4><br>
a glimpse, an <mark4>acknowledgment</mark4><br>
    it is enough and never enough-- <br>
we toss our heads         and say good <mark4>night</mark4><br>
    moving away on bitter bitter snow.<br>
