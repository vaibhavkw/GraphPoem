Title : That Nature is a Heraclitean Fire and of the comfort of the Resurrection <br>
Author : Gerard Manley Hopkins <br><br>

Cloud-puffball, torn tufts, tossed pillows | flaunt forth, then chevy on an <mark3>air-</mark3><br>
Built thoroughfare: heaven-roysterers, in gay-gangs | they throng; they glitter in <mark3>marches.</mark3><br>
Down roughcast, down dazzling whitewash, | wherever an elm <mark3>arches,</mark3><br>
Shivelights and shadowtackle in long | lashes lace, lance, and <mark3>pair.</mark3><br>
Delightfully the bright wind boisterous | ropes, wrestles, beats earth <mark3>bare</mark3><br>
Of yestertempest's creases; | in pool and rut peel parches <br>
Squandering ooze to squeezed | dough, crust, dust; stanches, <mark3>starches</mark3><br>
Squadroned masks and manmarks | treadmire toil <mark3>there</mark3><br>
Footfretted in it. Million-fueled, | nature's bonfire burns <mark3>on.</mark3><br>
But quench her bonniest, dearest | to her, her clearest-selved <mark3>spark</mark3><br>
Man, how fast his firedint, | his mark on mind, is <mark3>gone!</mark3><br>
Both are in an unfathomable, all is in an enormous <mark3>dark</mark3><br>
Drowned. O pity and indig | nation! Manshape, that <mark4>shone</mark4><br>
Sheer off, disseveral, a star, | death blots black out; nor <mark3>mark</mark3><br>
Is any of him at all so <mark3>stark</mark3><br>
But vastness blurs and time | beats level. Enough! the <mark4>Resurrection,</mark4><br>
A heart's-clarion! Away grief's gasping, | joyless days, dejection. <br>
Across my foundering deck <mark1>shone</mark1><br>
A beacon, an eternal beam. | Flesh fade, and mortal <mark3>trash</mark3><br>
Fall to the residuary worm; | world's wildfire, leave but <mark3>ash:</mark3><br>
In a <mark3>flash</mark3>, at a trumpet <mark3>crash,</mark3><br>
I am all at once what Christ is, | since he was what I am, <mark3>and</mark3><br>
This Jack, joke, poor potsherd, | patch, matchwood, immortal <mark3>diamond,</mark3><br>
Is immortal <mark1>diamond.</mark1><br>
