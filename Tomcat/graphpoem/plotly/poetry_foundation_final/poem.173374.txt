Title : A Lecture upon the Shadow <br>
Author : John Donne <br><br>

Stand still, and I will read to <mark3>thee</mark3><br>
A lecture, love, in love's philosophy. <br>
These three hours that we have <mark3>spent,</mark3><br>
Walking here, two shadows <mark3>went</mark3><br>
Along with us, which we ourselves <mark4>produc'd.</mark4><br>
But, now the sun is just above our <mark3>head,</mark3><br>
We do those shadows <mark3>tread,</mark3><br>
         And to brave clearness all things are reduc'd. <br>
So whilst our infant loves did <mark3>grow,</mark3><br>
Disguises did, and shadows, <mark3>flow</mark3><br>
From us, and our cares; but now 'tis not <mark3>so.</mark3><br>
That love has not attain'd the high'st <mark3>degree,</mark3><br>
Which is still diligent lest others <mark3>see.</mark3><br>
<br>
Except our loves at this noon <mark3>stay,</mark3><br>
We shall new shadows make the other <mark3>way.</mark3><br>
As the first were made to <mark4>blind</mark4><br>
Others, these which come <mark3>behind</mark3><br>
Will work upon <mark4>ourselves</mark4>, and blind our <mark4>eyes.</mark4><br>
If our loves faint, and westwardly <mark3>decline,</mark3><br>
To me thou, falsely, <mark3>thine,</mark3><br>
And I to thee mine actions shall <mark3>disguise.</mark3><br>
The morning shadows wear <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
But these grow longer all the <mark3>day;</mark3><br>
But oh, love's day is short, if love <mark3>decay.</mark3><br>
Love is a growing, or full constant <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
And his first minute, after noon, is <mark3>night.</mark3><br>
