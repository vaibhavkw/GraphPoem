Title : from Idylls of the King: The Last Tournament <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

Dagonet, the fool, whom Gawain in his <mark4>mood</mark4><br>
Had made mock-knight of Arthur's Table <mark4>Round,</mark4><br>
At Camelot, high above the yellowing <mark4>woods,</mark4><br>
Danced like a wither'd leaf before the <mark4>hall.</mark4><br>
And toward him from the hall, with harp in <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
And from the crown thereof a <mark1>carcanet</mark1><br>
Of ruby swaying to and fro, the <mark4>prize</mark4><br>
Of Tristram in the jousts of <mark4>yesterday,</mark4><br>
Came Tristram, saying, "Why skip ye so, Sir <mark4>Fool?"</mark4><br>
<br>
For Arthur and Sir Lancelot riding <mark4>once</mark4><br>
Far down beneath a winding wall of <mark4>rock</mark4><br>
Heard a child wail. A stump of oak <mark4>half-dead.</mark4><br>
From roots like some black coil of carven <mark4>snakes,</mark4><br>
Clutch'd at the crag, and started thro' mid <mark3>air</mark3><br>
Bearing an eagle's nest: and thro' the <mark1>tree</mark1><br>
Rush'd ever a rainy <mark1>wind</mark1>, and thro' the <mark4>wind</mark4><br>
Pierced ever a child's cry: and crag and <mark1>tree</mark1><br>
Scaling, Sir Lancelot from the perilous <mark4>nest,</mark4><br>
This ruby necklace thrice around her <mark4>neck,</mark4><br>
And all unscarr'd from beak or talon, <mark4>brought</mark4><br>
A maiden babe; which Arthur pitying <mark4>took,</mark4><br>
Then gave it to his Queen to rear: the <mark4>Queen</mark4><br>
But coldly acquiescing, in her white <mark4>arms</mark4><br>
Received, and after loved it <mark4>tenderly,</mark4><br>
And named it Nestling; so forgot <mark4>herself</mark4><br>
A moment, and her cares; till that young <mark4>life</mark4><br>
Being smitten in mid heaven with mortal <mark4>cold</mark4><br>
Past from her; and in time the <mark1>carcanet</mark1><br>
Vext her with plaintive memories of the <mark4>child:</mark4><br>
So she, delivering it to Arthur, <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
"Take thou the jewels of this dead <mark4>innocence,</mark4><br>
And make them, an thou wilt, a <mark4>tourney-prize."</mark4><br>
<br>
To whom the King, "Peace to thine <mark4>eagle-borne</mark4><br>
Dead nestling, and this honour after <mark4>death,</mark4><br>
Following thy will! but, O my Queen, I <mark4>muse</mark4><br>
Why ye not wear on arm, or neck, or <mark4>zone</mark4><br>
Those diamonds that I rescued from the tarn, <br>
And Lancelot won, methought, for thee to <mark3>wear."</mark3><br>
<br>
"Would rather you had let them fall," she <mark4>cried,</mark4><br>
"Plunge and be lost--ill-fated as they <mark3>were,</mark3><br>
A bitterness to me!--ye look <mark4>amazed,</mark4><br>
Not knowing they were lost as soon as <mark4>given--</mark4><br>
Slid from my hands, when I was leaning <mark4>out</mark4><br>
Above the river--that unhappy <mark1>child</mark1><br>
Past in her barge: but rosier luck will <mark3>go</mark3><br>
With these rich jewels, seeing that they <mark3>came</mark3><br>
Not from the skeleton of a <mark5>brother-slayer,</mark5><br>
But the sweet body of a maiden <mark1>babe.</mark1><br>
Perchance--who knows?--the purest of thy <mark4>knights</mark4><br>
May win them for the purest of my <mark4>maids."</mark4><br>
<br>
She ended, and the cry of a great <mark1>jousts</mark1><br>
With trumpet-blowings ran on all the <mark4>ways</mark4><br>
From Camelot in among the faded <mark4>fields</mark4><br>
To furthest towers; and everywhere the <mark1>knights</mark1><br>
Arm'd for a day of glory before the <mark1>King.</mark1><br>
<br>
But on the hither side of that loud <mark4>morn</mark4><br>
Into the hall stagger'd, his visage ribb'd <br>
From ear to ear with dogwhip-weals, his <mark4>nose</mark4><br>
Bridge-broken, one eye out, and one hand <mark4>off,</mark4><br>
And one with shatter'd fingers dangling <mark3>lame,</mark3><br>
A churl, to whom indignantly the <mark1>King,</mark1><br>
<br>
"My churl, for whom Christ died, what evil <mark4>beast</mark4><br>
Hath drawn his claws athwart thy face? or <mark4>fiend?</mark4><br>
Man was it who marr'd heaven's image in thee <mark4>thus?"</mark4><br>
<br>
Then, sputtering thro' the hedge of splinter'd <mark4>teeth,</mark4><br>
Yet strangers to the tongue, and with blunt <mark4>stump</mark4><br>
Pitch-blacken'd sawing the air, said the maim'd <mark1>churl,</mark1><br>
<br>
"He took them and he drave them to his <mark4>tower--</mark4><br>
Some hold he was a table-knight of <mark4>thine--</mark4><br>
A hundred goodly ones--the Red Knight, <mark3>he--</mark3><br>
Lord, I was tending swine, and the Red <mark4>Knight</mark4><br>
Brake in upon me and drave them to his <mark1>tower;</mark1><br>
And when I call'd upon thy name as <mark4>one</mark4><br>
That doest right by gentle and by <mark1>churl,</mark1><br>
Maim'd me and maul'd, and would outright have <mark4>slain,</mark4><br>
Save that he sware me to a message, <mark4>saying,</mark4><br>
'Tell thou the King and all his liars, that <mark3>I</mark3><br>
Have founded my Round Table in the <mark4>North,</mark4><br>
And whatsoever his own knights have <mark4>sworn</mark4><br>
My knights have sworn the counter to it--and <mark5>say</mark5><br>
My tower is full of harlots, like his <mark4>court,</mark4><br>
But mine are worthier, seeing they <mark4>profess</mark4><br>
To be none other than themselves--and <mark1>say</mark1><br>
My knights are all adulterers like his <mark4>own,</mark4><br>
But mine are truer, seeing they <mark1>profess</mark1><br>
To be none other; and say his hour is <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
The heathen are upon him, his long <mark4>lance</mark4><br>
Broken, and his Excalibur a straw.' <mark3>"</mark3><br>
<br>
       Then Arthur turn'd to Kay the seneschal, <br>
"Take thou my churl, and tend him <mark4>curiously</mark4><br>
Like a king's heir, till all his hurts be <mark4>whole.</mark4><br>
The heathen--but that ever-climbing <mark4>wave,</mark4><br>
Hurl'd back again so often in empty <mark4>foam,</mark4><br>
Hath lain for years at rest--and <mark4>renegades,</mark4><br>
Thieves, bandits, leavings of confusion, <mark4>whom</mark4><br>
The wholesome realm is purged of otherwhere, <br>
Friends, thro' your manhood and your <mark5>fealty,--now</mark5><br>
Make their last head like Satan in the <mark1>North.</mark1><br>
My younger knights, new-made, in whom your <mark3>flower</mark3><br>
Waits to be solid fruit of golden <mark4>deeds,</mark4><br>
Move with me toward their quelling, which <mark4>achieved,</mark4><br>
The loneliest ways are safe from shore to <mark4>shore.</mark4><br>
But thou, Sir Lancelot, sitting in my <mark4>place</mark4><br>
Enchair'd to-morrow, arbitrate the <mark4>field;</mark4><br>
For wherefore shouldst thou care to mingle with <mark4>it</mark4><br>
Only to yield my Queen her own <mark4>again?</mark4><br>
Speak, Lancelot, thou art silent: is it <mark4>well?"</mark4><br>
<br>
Thereto Sir Lancelot answer'd, "It is <mark1>well:</mark1><br>
Yet better if the King abide, and <mark4>leave</mark4><br>
The leading of his younger knights to <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
Else, for the King has will'd it, it is <mark1>well."</mark1><br>
<br>
Then Arthur rose and Lancelot follow'd <mark4>him,</mark4><br>
And while they stood without the doors, the <mark1>King</mark1><br>
Turn'd to him saying, "Is it then so <mark1>well?</mark1><br>
Or mine the blame that oft I seem as <mark1>he</mark1><br>
Of whom was written, 'A sound is in his <mark4>ears'?</mark4><br>
The foot that loiters, bidden go,--the <mark4>glance</mark4><br>
That only seems half-loyal to <mark4>command,--</mark4><br>
A manner somewhat fall'n from <mark4>reverence--</mark4><br>
Or have I dream'd the bearing of our <mark1>knights</mark1><br>
Tells of a manhood ever less and <mark4>lower?</mark4><br>
Or whence the fear lest this my realm, uprear'd, <br>
By noble deeds at one with noble <mark4>vows,</mark4><br>
From flat confusion and brute <mark5>violences,</mark5><br>
Reel back into the beast, and be no <mark3>more?"</mark3><br>
<br>
He spoke, and taking all his younger <mark1>knights,</mark1><br>
Down the slope city rode, and sharply <mark4>turn'd</mark4><br>
North by the gate. In her high bower the <mark1>Queen,</mark1><br>
Working a tapestry, lifted up her <mark4>head,</mark4><br>
Watch'd her lord pass, and knew not that she <mark4>sigh'd.</mark4><br>
Then ran across her memory the strange <mark4>rhyme</mark4><br>
Of bygone Merlin, "Where is he who <mark4>knows?</mark4><br>
From the great deep to the great deep he <mark3>goes."</mark3><br>
<br>
But when the morning of a <mark4>tournament,</mark4><br>
By these in earnest those in mockery <mark4>call'd</mark4><br>
The Tournament of the Dead <mark1>Innocence,</mark1><br>
Brake with a wet wind blowing, <mark4>Lancelot,</mark4><br>
Round whose sick head all night, like birds of <mark3>prey,</mark3><br>
The words of Arthur flying <mark4>shriek'd</mark4>, <mark4>arose,</mark4><br>
And down a streetway hung with folds of <mark4>pure</mark4><br>
White samite, and by fountains running <mark4>wine,</mark4><br>
Where children sat in white with cups of <mark4>gold,</mark4><br>
Moved to the lists, and there, with slow sad <mark4>steps</mark4><br>
Ascending, fill'd his double-dragon'd <mark4>chair.</mark4><br>
<br>
He glanced and saw the stately <mark4>galleries,</mark4><br>
Dame, damsel, each thro' worship of their <mark1>Queen</mark1><br>
White-robed in honour of the stainless <mark1>child,</mark1><br>
And some with scatter'd jewels, like a <mark4>bank</mark4><br>
Of maiden snow mingled with sparks of <mark4>fire.</mark4><br>
He look'd but once, and vail'd his eyes <mark1>again.</mark1><br>
<br>
The sudden trumpet sounded as in a <mark4>dream</mark4><br>
To ears but half-awaked, then one low <mark4>roll</mark4><br>
Of Autumn thunder, and the jousts <mark4>began:</mark4><br>
And ever the wind blew, and yellowing <mark4>leaf</mark4><br>
And gloom and <mark4>gleam</mark4>, and shower and shorn <mark4>plume</mark4><br>
Went down it. Sighing weariedly, as <mark1>one</mark1><br>
Who sits and gazes on a faded <mark1>fire,</mark1><br>
When all the goodlier guests are past <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
Sat their great umpire, looking o'er the <mark4>lists.</mark4><br>
He saw the laws that ruled the <mark1>tournament</mark1><br>
Broken, but spake not; once, a knight cast <mark4>down</mark4><br>
Before his throne of arbitration <mark4>cursed</mark4><br>
The dead babe and the follies of the <mark1>King;</mark1><br>
And once the laces of a helmet <mark4>crack'd,</mark4><br>
And show'd him, like a vermin in its <mark3>hole,</mark3><br>
Modred, a narrow face: anon he <mark4>heard</mark4><br>
The voice that billow'd round the barriers <mark4>roar</mark4><br>
An ocean-sounding welcome to one <mark1>knight,</mark1><br>
But newly-enter'd, taller than the <mark4>rest,</mark4><br>
And armour'd all in forest green, <mark5>whereon</mark5><br>
There tript a hundred tiny silver <mark4>deer,</mark4><br>
And wearing but a holly-spray for <mark3>crest,</mark3><br>
With ever-scattering berries, and on <mark4>shield</mark4><br>
A spear, a harp, a bugle--Tristram--late <br>
From overseas in Brittany <mark4>return'd,</mark4><br>
And marriage with a princess of that <mark4>realm,</mark4><br>
Isolt the White--Sir Tristram of the <mark1>Woods--</mark1><br>
Whom Lancelot knew, had held sometime with <mark4>pain</mark4><br>
His own against him, and now yearn'd to <mark4>shake</mark4><br>
The burthen off his heart in one full <mark4>shock</mark4><br>
With Tristram ev'n to death: his strong hands <mark5>gript</mark5><br>
And dinted the gilt dragons right and <mark4>left,</mark4><br>
Until he groan'd for wrath--so many of <mark4>those,</mark4><br>
That ware their ladies' colours on the casque, <br>
Drew from before Sir Tristram to the <mark4>bounds,</mark4><br>
And there with gibes and flickering mockeries <br>
Stood, while he mutter'd, "Craven crests! O <mark4>shame!</mark4><br>
What faith have these in whom they sware to <mark4>love?</mark4><br>
The glory of our Round Table is no <mark1>more."</mark1><br>
<br>
So Tristram won, and Lancelot gave, the <mark4>gems,</mark4><br>
Not speaking other word than "Hast thou <mark4>won?</mark4><br>
Art thou the purest, brother? See, the <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
Wherewith thou takest this, is red!" to <mark1>whom</mark1><br>
Tristram, half plagued by Lancelot's languorous <mark1>mood,</mark1><br>
Made answer, "Ay, but wherefore toss me <mark4>this</mark4><br>
Like a dry bone cast to some hungry <mark4>hound?</mark4><br>
Let be thy fair Queen's fantasy. Strength of <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
And might of limb, but mainly use and <mark4>skill,</mark4><br>
Are winners in this pastime of our <mark1>King.</mark1><br>
My hand--belike the lance hath dript upon <mark1>it--</mark1><br>
No blood of mine, I trow; but O chief <mark1>knight,</mark1><br>
Right arm of Arthur in the <mark4>battlefield,</mark4><br>
Great brother, thou nor I have made the <mark4>world;</mark4><br>
Be happy in thy fair Queen as I in <mark4>mine."</mark4><br>
<br>
And Tristram round the gallery made his <mark4>horse</mark4><br>
Caracole; then bow'd his homage, bluntly <mark1>saying,</mark1><br>
"Fair damsels, each to him who worships <mark4>each</mark4><br>
Sole Queen of Beauty and of love, <mark4>behold</mark4><br>
This day my Queen of Beauty is not <mark4>here."</mark4><br>
And most of these were mute, some anger'd, <mark1>one</mark1><br>
Murmuring, "All courtesy is dead," and <mark1>one,</mark1><br>
"The glory of our Round Table is no <mark1>more."</mark1><br>
<br>
Then fell thick rain, plume droopt and mantle <mark4>clung,</mark4><br>
And pettish cries awoke, and the wan <mark3>day</mark3><br>
Went glooming down in wet and <mark4>weariness:</mark4><br>
But under her black brows a swarthy <mark1>one</mark1><br>
Laugh'd shrilly, crying, "Praise the patient <mark4>saints,</mark4><br>
Our one white day of Innocence hath <mark4>past,</mark4><br>
Tho' somewhat draggled at the <mark4>skirt</mark4>, So be <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
The snowdrop only, flowering thro' the <mark4>year,</mark4><br>
Would make the world as blank as <mark4>Winter-tide.</mark4><br>
Come--let us gladden their sad <mark4>eyes</mark4>, our <mark4>Queen's</mark4><br>
And Lancelot's, at this night's <mark4>solemnity</mark4><br>
With all the kindlier colours of the <mark1>field."</mark1><br>
<br>
So dame and damsel glitter'd at the <mark4>feast</mark4><br>
Variously gay: for he that tells the <mark4>tale</mark4><br>
Liken'd them, saying, as when an hour of <mark1>cold</mark1><br>
Falls on the mountain in midsummer <mark4>snows,</mark4><br>
And all the purple slopes of mountain <mark4>flowers</mark4><br>
Pass under white, till the warm hour <mark4>returns</mark4><br>
With veer of wind, and all are flowers <mark1>again;</mark1><br>
So dame and damsel cast the simple <mark4>white,</mark4><br>
And glowing in all colours, the live <mark4>grass,</mark4><br>
Rose-campion, bluebell, kingcup, poppy, <mark4>glanced</mark4><br>
About the revels, and with mirth so <mark4>loud</mark4><br>
Beyond all use, that, half-amazed, the <mark1>Queen,</mark1><br>
And wroth at Tristram and the lawless <mark1>jousts,</mark1><br>
Brake up their sports, then slowly to her <mark4>bower</mark4><br>
<mark4>Parted</mark4>, and in her bosom pain was <mark4>lord.</mark4><br>
<br>
And little Dagonet on the morrow <mark1>morn,</mark1><br>
High over all the yellowing <mark4>Autumn-tide,</mark4><br>
Danced like a wither'd leaf before the <mark1>hall.</mark1><br>
Then Tristram saying, "Why skip ye so, Sir <mark1>Fool?"</mark1><br>
Wheel'd round on either heel, Dagonet <mark3>replied,</mark3><br>
"Belike for lack of wiser <mark5>company;</mark5><br>
Or being fool, and seeing too much <mark4>wit</mark4><br>
Makes the world rotten, why, belike I <mark4>skip</mark4><br>
To know myself the wisest knight of <mark4>all."</mark4><br>
"Ay, fool," said Tristram, "but 'tis eating <mark3>dry</mark3><br>
To dance without a catch, a roundelay <br>
To dance to." Then he twangled on his <mark4>harp,</mark4><br>
And while he twangled little Dagonet <mark4>stood</mark4><br>
Quiet as any water-sodden log <br>
Stay'd in the wandering warble of a <mark4>brook;</mark4><br>
But when the twangling ended, skipt <mark1>again;</mark1><br>
And being ask'd, "Why skipt ye not, Sir <mark1>Fool?"</mark1><br>
Made answer, "I had liefer twenty <mark4>years</mark4><br>
Skip to the broken music of my <mark4>brains</mark4><br>
Than any broken music thou canst <mark4>make."</mark4><br>
Then <mark4>Tristram</mark4>, waiting for the quip to <mark1>come,</mark1><br>
"Good now, what music have I broken, <mark1>fool?"</mark1><br>
And little Dagonet, skipping, "Arthur, the <mark4>King's;</mark4><br>
For when thou playest that air with Queen <mark1>Isolt,</mark1><br>
Thou makest broken music with thy <mark4>bride,</mark4><br>
Her daintier namesake down in <mark4>Brittany--</mark4><br>
And so thou breakest Arthur's music, <mark5>too."</mark5><br>
"Save for that broken music in thy <mark1>brains,</mark1><br>
Sir Fool," said Tristram, "I would break thy <mark1>head.</mark1><br>
Fool, I came late, the heathen wars were <mark4>o'er,</mark4><br>
The life had flown, we sware but by the <mark4>shell--</mark4><br>
I am but a fool to reason with a <mark1>fool--</mark1><br>
Come, thou art crabb'd and sour: but lean me <mark1>down,</mark1><br>
Sir Dagonet, one of thy long asses' <mark1>ears,</mark1><br>
And harken if my music be not <mark3>true.</mark3><br>
<br>
"'Free love--free field--we love but while we <mark3>may:</mark3><br>
The woods are hush'd, their music is no <mark1>more:</mark1><br>
The leaf is dead, the yearning past <mark1>away:</mark1><br>
New leaf, new life--the days of frost are <mark1>o'er:</mark1><br>
New life, new love, to suit the newer <mark1>day:</mark1><br>
New loves are sweet as those that went <mark3>before:</mark3><br>
Free love--free field--we love but while we <mark1>may.'</mark1><br>
<br>
"Ye might have moved slow-measure to my <mark4>tune,</mark4><br>
Not stood stockstill. I made it in the <mark1>woods,</mark1><br>
And heard it ring as true as tested <mark1>gold."</mark1><br>
<br>
But Dagonet with one foot poised in his <mark1>hand,</mark1><br>
"Friend, did ye mark that fountain <mark1>yesterday</mark1><br>
Made to run wine?--but this had run <mark4>itself</mark4><br>
All out like a long life to a sour <mark4>end--</mark4><br>
And them that round it sat with golden <mark4>cups</mark4><br>
To hand the wine to whosoever <mark1>came--</mark1><br>
The twelve small damosels white as <mark1>Innocence,</mark1><br>
In honour of poor Innocence the <mark1>babe,</mark1><br>
Who left the gems which Innocence the <mark1>Queen</mark1><br>
Lent to the <mark1>King</mark1>, and Innocence the <mark1>King</mark1><br>
Gave for a prize--and one of those white <mark4>slips</mark4><br>
Handed her cup and piped, the pretty <mark1>one,</mark1><br>
'Drink, drink, Sir Fool,' and thereupon I <mark4>drank,</mark4><br>
Spat--pish--the cup was <mark4>gold</mark4>, the draught was <mark4>mud."</mark4><br>
<br>
And Tristram, "Was it muddier than thy <mark4>gibes?</mark4><br>
Is all the laughter gone dead out of <mark3>thee?--</mark3><br>
Not marking how the knighthood mock thee, <mark1>fool--</mark1><br>
'Fear God: honour the King--his one true <mark1>knight--</mark1><br>
Sole follower of the vows'--for here be <mark3>they</mark3><br>
Who knew thee swine enow before I <mark1>came,</mark1><br>
Smuttier than blasted grain: but when the <mark1>King</mark1><br>
Had made thee fool, thy vanity so shot <mark4>up</mark4><br>
It frighted all free fool from out thy <mark1>heart;</mark1><br>
Which left thee less than fool, and less than <mark4>swine,</mark4><br>
A naked aught--yet swine I hold thee <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
For I have flung thee pearls and find thee <mark1>swine."</mark1><br>
<br>
And little Dagonet mincing with his <mark4>feet,</mark4><br>
"Knight, an ye fling those rubies round my <mark1>neck</mark1><br>
In lieu of hers, I'll hold thou hast some <mark4>touch</mark4><br>
Of music, since I care not for thy <mark4>pearls.</mark4><br>
Swine? I have wallow'd, I have wash'd--the <mark1>world</mark1><br>
Is flesh and shadow--I have had my <mark1>day.</mark1><br>
The dirty nurse, Experience, in her <mark4>kind</mark4><br>
Hath foul'd me--an I <mark4>wallow'd</mark4>, then I <mark4>wash'd--</mark4><br>
I have had my day and my <mark4>philosophies--</mark4><br>
And thank the Lord I am King Arthur's <mark1>fool.</mark1><br>
Swine, say ye? swine, goats, asses, rams and <mark4>geese</mark4><br>
Troop'd round a Paynim harper once, who <mark5>thrumm'd</mark5><br>
On such a wire as musically as <mark5>thou</mark5><br>
Some such fine song--but never a king's <mark1>fool."</mark1><br>
<br>
And Tristram, "Then were swine, goats, asses, <mark1>geese</mark1><br>
The wiser fools, seeing thy Paynim <mark4>bard</mark4><br>
Had such a mastery of his <mark4>mystery</mark4><br>
That he could harp his wife up out of <mark4>hell."</mark4><br>
<br>
Then Dagonet, turning on the ball of his <mark4>foot,</mark4><br>
"And whither harp'st thou thine? down! and <mark3>thyself</mark3><br>
Down! and two more: a helpful harper <mark1>thou,</mark1><br>
That harpest downward! Dost thou know the <mark4>star</mark4><br>
We call the harp of Arthur up in <mark4>heaven?"</mark4><br>
<br>
And Tristram, "Ay, Sir Fool, for when our <mark1>King</mark1><br>
Was victor wellnigh day by day, the <mark1>knights,</mark1><br>
Glorying in each new glory, set his <mark3>name</mark3><br>
High on all hills, and in the signs of <mark1>heaven."</mark1><br>
<br>
And Dagonet answer'd, "Ay, and when the <mark4>land</mark4><br>
Was freed, and the Queen false, ye set <mark3>yourself</mark3><br>
To babble about him, all to show your <mark1>wit--</mark1><br>
And whether he were King by <mark4>courtesy,</mark4><br>
Or King by right--and so went harping <mark1>down</mark1><br>
The black king's highway, got so far, and <mark3>grew</mark3><br>
So witty that we play'd at ducks and <mark4>drakes</mark4><br>
With Arthur's vows on the great lake of <mark1>fire.</mark1><br>
Tuwhoo! do ye see it? do ye see the <mark1>star?"</mark1><br>
<br>
"Nay, fool," said Tristram, "not in open <mark1>day."</mark1><br>
And Dagonet, "Nay, nor will: I see it and <mark4>hear.</mark4><br>
It makes a silent music up in <mark1>heaven,</mark1><br>
And I, and Arthur and the angels <mark1>hear,</mark1><br>
And then we skip." "Lo, fool," he said, "ye <mark4>talk</mark4><br>
Fool's treason: is the King thy brother <mark1>fool?"</mark1><br>
Then little Dagonet clapt his hands and <mark4>shrill'd,</mark4><br>
"Ay, ay, my brother fool, the king of <mark4>fools!</mark4><br>
Conceits himself as God that he can <mark1>make</mark1><br>
Figs out of thistles, silk from bristles, <mark4>milk</mark4><br>
From burning spurge, honey from <mark4>hornet-combs,</mark4><br>
And men from beasts--Long live the king of <mark1>fools!"</mark1><br>
<br>
And down the city Dagonet danced <mark1>away;</mark1><br>
But thro' the slowly-mellowing <mark4>avenues</mark4><br>
And solitary passes of the <mark4>wood</mark4><br>
Rode Tristram toward Lyonnesse and the <mark4>west.</mark4><br>
Before him fled the face of Queen <mark1>Isolt</mark1><br>
With ruby-circled neck, but <mark4>evermore</mark4><br>
Past, as a rustle or twitter in the <mark1>wood</mark1><br>
Made dull his inner, keen his outer <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
For all that walk'd, or crept, or perch'd, or <mark3>flew.</mark3><br>
Anon the face, as, when a gust hath <mark4>blown,</mark4><br>
Unruffling waters re-collect the <mark4>shape</mark4><br>
Of one that in them sees himself, <mark1>return'd;</mark1><br>
But at the slot or fewmets of a <mark1>deer,</mark1><br>
Or ev'n a fall'n feather, vanish'd <mark1>again.</mark1><br>
<br>
So on for all that day from lawn to <mark4>lawn</mark4><br>
Thro' many a league-long bower he rode. At <mark4>length</mark4><br>
A lodge of intertwisted <mark4>beechen-boughs</mark4><br>
Furze-cramm'd, and bracken-rooft, the which <mark3>himself</mark3><br>
Built for a summer day with Queen <mark1>Isolt</mark1><br>
Against a shower, dark in the golden <mark4>grove</mark4><br>
Appearing, sent his fancy back to <mark4>where</mark4><br>
She lived a moon in that low lodge with <mark1>him:</mark1><br>
Till Mark her lord had past, the Cornish <mark1>King,</mark1><br>
With six or seven, when Tristram was <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
And snatch'd her thence; yet dreading worse than <mark1>shame</mark1><br>
Her warrior Tristram, spake not any <mark4>word,</mark4><br>
But bode his hour, devising wretchedness. <br>
<br>
And now that desert lodge to Tristram <mark5>lookt</mark5><br>
So sweet, that halting, in he past, and <mark4>sank</mark4><br>
Down on a drift of foliage <mark4>random-blown;</mark4><br>
But could not rest for musing how to smoothe <br>
And sleek his marriage over to the <mark1>Queen.</mark1><br>
Perchance in lone Tintagil far from <mark1>all</mark1><br>
The tonguesters of the court she had not <mark1>heard.</mark1><br>
But then what folly had sent him <mark4>overseas</mark4><br>
After she left him lonely here? a <mark1>name?</mark1><br>
Was it the name of one in <mark1>Brittany,</mark1><br>
Isolt, the daughter of the King? "Isolt <br>
Of the white hands" they call'd her: the sweet <mark1>name</mark1><br>
Allured him first, and then the maid <mark1>herself,</mark1><br>
Who served him well with those white hands of <mark4>hers,</mark4><br>
And loved him well, until himself had <mark4>thought</mark4><br>
He loved her also, wedded <mark4>easily,</mark4><br>
But left her all as easily, and <mark1>return'd.</mark1><br>
The black-blue Irish hair and Irish <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
Had drawn him home--what marvel? then he <mark4>laid</mark4><br>
His brows upon the drifted leaf and <mark4>dream'd.</mark4><br>
<br>
He seem'd to pace the strand of <mark1>Brittany</mark1><br>
Between Isolt of Britain and his <mark1>bride,</mark1><br>
And show'd them both the ruby-chain, and <mark4>both</mark4><br>
Began to struggle for it, till his <mark1>Queen</mark1><br>
Graspt it so <mark4>hard</mark4>, that all her hand was <mark4>red.</mark4><br>
Then cried the Breton, "Look, her hand is <mark1>red!</mark1><br>
These be no rubies, this is frozen <mark4>blood,</mark4><br>
And melts within her hand--her hand is <mark4>hot</mark4><br>
With ill desires, but this I gave thee, <mark4>look,</mark4><br>
Is all as cool and white as any <mark1>flower."</mark1><br>
Follow'd a rush of eagle's wings, and <mark4>then</mark4><br>
A whimpering of the spirit of the <mark1>child,</mark1><br>
Because the twain had spoil'd her <mark1>carcanet.</mark1><br>
<br>
He <mark4>dream'd</mark4>, but Arthur with a hundred <mark4>spears</mark4><br>
Rode far, till o'er the illimitable <mark4>reed,</mark4><br>
And many a glancing plash and sallowy <mark4>isle,</mark4><br>
The wide-wing'd sunset of the misty <mark4>marsh</mark4><br>
Glared on a huge machicolated <mark1>tower</mark1><br>
That stood with open <mark4>doors</mark4>, whereout was <mark4>roll'd</mark4><br>
A roar of riot, as from men <mark4>secure</mark4><br>
Amid their <mark4>marshes</mark4>, ruffians at their <mark4>ease</mark4><br>
Among their harlot-brides, an evil <mark4>song.</mark4><br>
"Lo there," said one of Arthur's youth, for <mark4>there,</mark4><br>
High on a grim dead tree before the <mark1>tower,</mark1><br>
A goodly brother of the Table <mark1>Round</mark1><br>
Swung by the neck: and on the boughs a <mark1>shield</mark1><br>
Showing a shower of blood in a field <mark4>noir,</mark4><br>
And therebeside a horn, inflamed the <mark1>knights</mark1><br>
At that dishonour done the gilded <mark3>spur,</mark3><br>
Till each would clash the shield, and blow the <mark4>horn.</mark4><br>
But Arthur waved them back. Alone he <mark4>rode.</mark4><br>
Then at the dry harsh roar of the great <mark1>horn,</mark1><br>
That sent the face of all the marsh <mark4>aloft</mark4><br>
An ever upward-rushing storm and <mark4>cloud</mark4><br>
Of shriek and plume, the Red Knight heard, and <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
Even to tipmost lance and topmost <mark4>helm,</mark4><br>
In blood-red armour sallying, howl'd to the <mark1>King,</mark1><br>
<br>
"The teeth of Hell flay bare and gnash thee <mark4>flat!--</mark4><br>
Lo! art thou not that eunuch-hearted <mark1>King</mark1><br>
Who fain had clipt free manhood from the <mark1>world--</mark1><br>
The woman-worshipper? Yea, God's curse, and <mark1>I!</mark1><br>
Slain was the brother of my <mark5>paramour</mark5><br>
By a knight of <mark3>thine</mark3>, and I that heard her <mark4>whine</mark4><br>
And snivel, being eunuch-hearted <mark1>too,</mark1><br>
Sware by the scorpion-worm that twists in <mark1>hell,</mark1><br>
And stings itself to everlasting <mark1>death,</mark1><br>
To hang whatever knight of thine I <mark4>fought</mark4><br>
And tumbled. Art thou King?--Look to thy <mark1>life!"</mark1><br>
<br>
He ended: Arthur knew the <mark4>voice</mark4>, the <mark4>face</mark4><br>
Wellnigh was helmet-hidden, and the <mark1>name</mark1><br>
Went wandering somewhere darkling in his <mark4>mind.</mark4><br>
And Arthur deign'd not use of word or <mark4>sword,</mark4><br>
But let the drunkard, as he stretch'd from <mark1>horse</mark1><br>
To strike him, overbalancing his <mark4>bulk,</mark4><br>
Down from the causeway heavily to the <mark4>swamp</mark4><br>
Fall, as the crest of some slow-arching <mark1>wave,</mark1><br>
Heard in dead night along that <mark4>table-shore,</mark4><br>
Drops flat, and after the great waters <mark4>break</mark4><br>
Whitening for half a league, and thin <mark4>themselves,</mark4><br>
Far over sands marbled with moon and <mark1>cloud,</mark1><br>
From less and less to nothing; thus he <mark3>fell</mark3><br>
Head-heavy; then the knights, who watch'd him, <mark4>roar'd</mark4><br>
And shouted and leapt down upon the <mark4>fall'n;</mark4><br>
There trampled out his face from being <mark4>known,</mark4><br>
And sank his head in mire, and slimed <mark1>themselves:</mark1><br>
Nor heard the King for their own cries, but <mark4>sprang</mark4><br>
Thro' open doors, and swording right and <mark1>left</mark1><br>
Men, women, on their sodden <mark4>faces</mark4>, <mark4>hurl'd</mark4><br>
The tables over and the wines, and <mark3>slew</mark3><br>
Till all the rafters rang with <mark4>woman-yells,</mark4><br>
And all the pavement stream'd with <mark4>massacre:</mark4><br>
Then, echoing yell with yell, they fired the <mark1>tower,</mark1><br>
Which half that autumn night, like the live <mark1>North,</mark1><br>
Red-pulsing up thro' Alioth and Alcor, <br>
Made all above it, and a hundred <mark5>meres</mark5><br>
About it, as the water Moab <mark3>saw</mark3><br>
Come round by the East, and out beyond them <mark4>flush'd</mark4><br>
The long low dune, and lazy-plunging <mark3>sea.</mark3><br>
<br>
So all the ways were safe from shore to <mark1>shore,</mark1><br>
But in the heart of Arthur pain was <mark1>lord.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then, out of Tristram waking, the red <mark1>dream</mark1><br>
Fled with a shout, and that low lodge <mark1>return'd,</mark1><br>
Mid-forest, and the wind among the <mark4>boughs.</mark4><br>
He whistled his good warhorse left to <mark4>graze</mark4><br>
Among the forest greens, vaulted upon <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
And rode beneath an ever-showering <mark1>leaf,</mark1><br>
Till one lone woman, weeping near a <mark4>cross,</mark4><br>
Stay'd him. "Why weep ye?" "Lord," she said, "my <mark4>man</mark4><br>
Hath left me or is dead"; whereon he <mark1>thought--</mark1><br>
"What, if she hate me now? I would not <mark1>this.</mark1><br>
<mark4>What</mark4>, if she love me still? I would not <mark4>that.</mark4><br>
I know not what I would"--but said to <mark3>her,</mark3><br>
"Yet weep not thou, lest, if thy mate <mark4>return,</mark4><br>
He find thy favour changed and love thee <mark4>not"--</mark4><br>
Then pressing day by day thro' <mark1>Lyonnesse</mark1><br>
Last in a roky hollow, belling, <mark1>heard</mark1><br>
The hounds of Mark, and felt the goodly <mark4>hounds</mark4><br>
Yelp at his heart, but turning, past and <mark4>gain'd</mark4><br>
Tintagil, half in sea, and high on <mark1>land,</mark1><br>
A crown of <mark4>towers.</mark4><br>
<br>
Down in a casement <mark4>sat,</mark4><br>
A low sea-sunset glorying round her <mark4>hair</mark4><br>
And glossy-throated grace, Isolt the <mark1>Queen.</mark1><br>
And when she heard the feet of Tristram <mark4>grind</mark4><br>
The spiring stone that scaled about her <mark1>tower,</mark1><br>
Flush'd, started, met him at the doors, and <mark1>there</mark1><br>
Belted his body with her white <mark4>embrace,</mark4><br>
Crying aloud, "Not Mark--not Mark, my <mark4>soul!</mark4><br>
The footstep flutter'd me at first: not <mark1>he:</mark1><br>
Catlike thro' his own castle steals my <mark4>Mark,</mark4><br>
But warrior-wise thou stridest thro' his <mark4>halls</mark4><br>
Who hates thee, as I him--ev'n to the <mark1>death.</mark1><br>
My soul, I felt my hatred for my <mark1>Mark</mark1><br>
Quicken within me, and knew that thou wert <mark3>nigh."</mark3><br>
To whom Sir Tristram smiling, "I am <mark1>here.</mark1><br>
Let be thy Mark, seeing he is not <mark1>thine."</mark1><br>
<br>
And drawing somewhat backward she <mark1>replied,</mark1><br>
"Can he be wrong'd who is not ev'n his <mark1>own,</mark1><br>
But save for dread of thee had beaten <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Scratch'd, bitten, blinded, marr'd me somehow--Mark? <br>
What rights are his that dare not strike for <mark4>them?</mark4><br>
Not lift a hand--not, tho' he found me <mark1>thus!</mark1><br>
But harken! have ye met him? hence he <mark4>went</mark4><br>
To-day for three days' hunting--as he <mark1>said--</mark1><br>
And so returns belike within an <mark4>hour.</mark4><br>
Mark's way, my soul!--but eat not thou with <mark1>Mark,</mark1><br>
Because he hates thee even more than <mark4>fears;</mark4><br>
Nor drink: and when thou passest any <mark1>wood</mark1><br>
Close vizor, lest an arrow from the <mark4>bush</mark4><br>
Should leave me all alone with Mark and <mark1>hell.</mark1><br>
My God, the measure of my hate for <mark1>Mark</mark1><br>
Is as the measure of my love for <mark1>thee.''</mark1><br>
<br>
So, pluck'd one way by hate and one by <mark1>love,</mark1><br>
Drain'd of her force, again she sat, and <mark4>spake</mark4><br>
To Tristram, as he knelt before her, <mark1>saying,</mark1><br>
"O hunter, and O blower of the <mark1>horn,</mark1><br>
Harper, and thou hast been a rover <mark1>too,</mark1><br>
For, ere I mated with my shambling <mark1>king,</mark1><br>
Ye twain had fallen out about the <mark1>bride</mark1><br>
Of one--his name is out of me--the <mark1>prize,</mark1><br>
If prize she were--(what marvel--she could <mark3>see)--</mark3><br>
Thine, friend; and ever since my craven <mark4>seeks</mark4><br>
To wreck thee villainously: <mark4>but</mark4>, O Sir <mark1>Knight,</mark1><br>
What dame or damsel have ye kneel'd to <mark4>last?"</mark4><br>
<br>
And Tristram, "Last to my Queen <mark4>Paramount,</mark4><br>
Here now to my Queen Paramount of <mark1>love</mark1><br>
And loveliness--ay, lovelier than when <mark4>first</mark4><br>
Her light feet fell on our rough <mark1>Lyonnesse,</mark1><br>
Sailing from <mark4>Ireland."</mark4><br>
<br>
Softly laugh'd <mark1>Isolt;</mark1><br>
"Flatter me not, for hath not our great <mark1>Queen</mark1><br>
My dole of beauty trebled?" and he <mark1>said,</mark1><br>
"Her beauty is her beauty, and thine <mark1>thine,</mark1><br>
And thine is more to me--soft, gracious, <mark1>kind--</mark1><br>
Save when thy Mark is kindled on thy <mark4>lips</mark4><br>
Most gracious; but she, haughty ev'n to <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
Lancelot; for I have seen him wan enow <br>
To make one doubt if ever the great <mark1>Queen</mark1><br>
Have yielded him her <mark1>love."</mark1><br>
<br>
To whom <mark1>Isolt,</mark1><br>
"Ah then, false hunter and false harper, <mark1>thou</mark1><br>
Who brakest thro' the scruple of my <mark4>bond,</mark4><br>
Calling me thy white hind, and saying to <mark1>me</mark1><br>
That Guinevere had sinn'd against the <mark4>highest,</mark4><br>
And I--misyoked with such a want of <mark1>man--</mark1><br>
That I could hardly sin against the <mark4>lowest."</mark4><br>
<br>
He answer'd, "O my soul, be <mark4>comforted!</mark4><br>
If this be sweet, to sin in <mark4>leading-strings,</mark4><br>
If here be comfort, and if ours be <mark4>sin,</mark4><br>
Crown'd warrant had we for the crowning <mark1>sin</mark1><br>
That made us happy: but how ye greet me--fear <br>
And fault and doubt--no word of that fond <mark1>tale--</mark1><br>
Thy deep <mark4>heart-yearnings</mark4>, thy sweet <mark4>memories</mark4><br>
Of Tristram in that year he was <mark1>away."</mark1><br>
<br>
And, saddening on the sudden, spake <mark1>Isolt,</mark1><br>
"I had forgotten all in my strong joy <br>
To see thee--yearnings?--ay! <mark4>for</mark4>, hour by <mark1>hour,</mark1><br>
Here in the never-ended <mark4>afternoon,</mark4><br>
O sweeter than all memories of <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
Deeper than any yearnings after <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
Seem'd those far-rolling, westward-smiling <mark4>seas,</mark4><br>
Watch'd from this tower. Isolt of Britain <mark4>dash'd</mark4><br>
Before Isolt of Brittany on the <mark4>strand,</mark4><br>
Would that have chill'd her bride-kiss? Wedded <mark1>her?</mark1><br>
Fought in her father's battles? wounded <mark1>there?</mark1><br>
The King was all fulfill'd with <mark5>gratefulness,</mark5><br>
And she, my namesake of the <mark4>hands</mark4>, that <mark4>heal'd</mark4><br>
Thy hurt and heart with unguent and <mark4>caress--</mark4><br>
Well--can I wish her any huger <mark4>wrong</mark4><br>
Than having known thee? her too hast thou <mark1>left</mark1><br>
To pine and waste in those sweet <mark1>memories.</mark1><br>
O were I not my Mark's, by whom all <mark4>men</mark4><br>
Are noble, I should hate thee more than <mark1>love."</mark1><br>
<br>
And Tristram, fondling her light hands, <mark1>replied,</mark1><br>
"Grace, Queen, for being loved: she loved me <mark1>well.</mark1><br>
Did I love her? the name at least I <mark4>loved.</mark4><br>
Isolt?--I fought his battles, for <mark1>Isolt!</mark1><br>
The night was dark; the true star set. <mark1>Isolt!</mark1><br>
The name was ruler of the <mark5>dark--Isolt?</mark5><br>
Care not for her! patient, and prayerful, <mark4>meek,</mark4><br>
<mark4>Pale-blooded</mark4>, she will yield herself to <mark4>God."</mark4><br>
<br>
And Isolt answer'd, "Yea, and why not <mark1>I?</mark1><br>
Mine is the larger need, who am not <mark1>meek,</mark1><br>
Pale-blooded, prayerful. Let me tell thee <mark3>now.</mark3><br>
Here one black, mute midsummer night I <mark1>sat,</mark1><br>
Lonely, but musing on thee, wondering <mark1>where,</mark1><br>
Murmuring a light song I had heard thee <mark4>sing,</mark4><br>
And once or twice I spake thy name <mark4>aloud.</mark4><br>
Then flash'd a <mark4>levin-brand</mark4>, and near me <mark1>stood,</mark1><br>
In fuming sulphur blue and green, a <mark1>fiend--</mark1><br>
Mark's way to steal behind one in the <mark4>dark--</mark4><br>
For there was Mark: 'He has wedded her,' he <mark1>said,</mark1><br>
Not said, but hiss'd it: then this crown of <mark1>towers</mark1><br>
So shook to such a roar of all the <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
That here in utter dark I swoon'd <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
And woke again in utter dark, and <mark1>cried,</mark1><br>
'I will flee hence and give myself to <mark1>God'--</mark1><br>
And thou wert lying in thy new leman's <mark1>arms."</mark1><br>
<br>
Then Tristram, ever dallying with her <mark1>hand,</mark1><br>
"May God be with thee, sweet, when old and <mark3>gray,</mark3><br>
And past desire!" a saying that anger'd <mark1>her.</mark1><br>
"'May God be with thee, sweet, when thou art <mark4>old,</mark4><br>
And sweet no more to me!' I need Him <mark1>now.</mark1><br>
For when had Lancelot utter'd aught so <mark4>gross</mark4><br>
Ev'n to the swineherd's malkin in the <mark4>mast?</mark4><br>
The greater man, the greater <mark1>courtesy.</mark1><br>
Far other was the Tristram, Arthur's <mark1>knight!</mark1><br>
But thou, thro' ever harrying thy wild <mark4>beasts--</mark4><br>
Save that to touch a harp, tilt with a <mark1>lance</mark1><br>
Becomes thee well--art grown wild beast <mark1>thyself.</mark1><br>
How darest thou, if lover, push me <mark4>even</mark4><br>
In fancy from thy side, and set me <mark4>far</mark4><br>
In the gray distance, half a life <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
Her to be loved no more? Unsay it, unswear! <br>
Flatter me rather, seeing me so <mark4>weak,</mark4><br>
Broken with Mark and hate and <mark4>solitude,</mark4><br>
Thy marriage and mine own, that I should <mark4>suck</mark4><br>
Lies like sweet wines: lie to me: I <mark4>believe.</mark4><br>
Will ye not lie? not swear, as there ye <mark4>kneel,</mark4><br>
And solemnly as when ye sware to <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
The man of men, our King--My God, the <mark3>power</mark3><br>
Was once in vows when men believed the <mark1>King!</mark1><br>
They lied not then, who sware, and thro' their <mark1>vows</mark1><br>
The King prevailing made his realm:--I <mark1>say,</mark1><br>
Swear to me thou wilt love me ev'n when <mark1>old,</mark1><br>
Gray-hair'd, and past desire, and in <mark4>despair."</mark4><br>
<br>
Then Tristram, pacing moodily up and <mark1>down,</mark1><br>
"Vows! did you keep the vow you made to <mark1>Mark</mark1><br>
More than I mine? Lied, say ye? Nay, but <mark4>learnt,</mark4><br>
The vow that binds too strictly snaps <mark1>itself--</mark1><br>
My knighthood taught me this--ay, being <mark5>snapt--</mark5><br>
We run more counter to the soul <mark4>thereof</mark4><br>
Than had we never sworn. I swear no <mark1>more.</mark1><br>
I swore to the great King, and am <mark4>forsworn.</mark4><br>
For once--ev'n to the height--I honour'd <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
'Man, is he man at all?' <mark4>methought</mark4>, when <mark1>first</mark1><br>
I rode from our rough Lyonnesse, and <mark4>beheld</mark4><br>
That victor of the Pagan throned in <mark1>hall--</mark1><br>
His hair, a sun that ray'd from off a <mark3>brow</mark3><br>
Like hillsnow high in heaven, the steel-blue <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
The golden beard that clothed his lips with <mark4>light--</mark4><br>
Moreover, that weird legend of his <mark4>birth,</mark4><br>
With Merlin's mystic babble about his <mark1>end</mark1><br>
Amazed me; then his foot was on a <mark4>stool</mark4><br>
Shaped as a <mark4>dragon</mark4>, he seem'd to me no <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
But Michael trampling Satan; so I <mark5>sware,</mark5><br>
Being amazed: but this went by--The <mark1>vows!</mark1><br>
O ay--the wholesome madness of an <mark1>hour--</mark1><br>
They served their use, their time; for every <mark1>knight</mark1><br>
Believed himself a greater than <mark1>himself,</mark1><br>
And every follower eyed him as a <mark1>God;</mark1><br>
Till he, being lifted up beyond <mark1>himself,</mark1><br>
Did mightier deeds than elsewise he had <mark4>done,</mark4><br>
And so the realm was made; but then their <mark1>vows--</mark1><br>
First mainly thro' that sullying of our <mark1>Queen--</mark1><br>
Began to gall the knighthood, asking <mark4>whence</mark4><br>
Had Arthur right to bind them to <mark1>himself?</mark1><br>
Dropt down from heaven? wash'd up from out the <mark4>deep?</mark4><br>
They fail'd to trace him thro' the flesh and <mark1>blood</mark1><br>
Of our old kings: whence then? a doubtful <mark1>lord</mark1><br>
To bind them by inviolable <mark1>vows,</mark1><br>
Which flesh and blood perforce would <mark4>violate:</mark4><br>
For feel this arm of mine--the tide <mark4>within</mark4><br>
Red with free chase and heather-scented <mark1>air,</mark1><br>
Pulsing full man; can Arthur make me <mark1>pure</mark1><br>
As any maiden child? lock up my <mark4>tongue</mark4><br>
From uttering freely what I freely <mark1>hear?</mark1><br>
Bind me to one? The wide world laughs at <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
And worldling of the world am I, and <mark3>know</mark3><br>
The ptarmigan that whitens ere his <mark1>hour</mark1><br>
Woos his own end; we are not angels <mark1>here</mark1><br>
Nor shall be: vows--I am woodman of the <mark1>woods,</mark1><br>
And hear the garnet-headed yaffingale <br>
Mock them: my soul, we love but while we <mark1>may;</mark1><br>
And therefore is my love so large for <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
Seeing it is not bounded save by <mark1>love."</mark1><br>
<br>
Here ending, he moved toward her, and she <mark1>said,</mark1><br>
"Good: an I turn'd away my love for <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
To some one thrice as courteous as <mark1>thyself--</mark1><br>
For courtesy wins woman all as <mark1>well</mark1><br>
As valour may, but he that closes <mark1>both</mark1><br>
Is perfect, he is Lancelot--taller <mark4>indeed,</mark4><br>
Rosier and comelier, thou--but say I <mark1>loved</mark1><br>
This knightliest of all knights, and cast thee <mark4>back</mark4><br>
Thine own small saw, 'We love but while we <mark1>may,'</mark1><br>
Well then, what <mark4>answer?"</mark4><br>
<br>
He that while she <mark1>spake,</mark1><br>
Mindful of what he brought to adorn her <mark4>with,</mark4><br>
The jewels, had let one finger lightly <mark1>touch</mark1><br>
The warm white apple of her throat, <mark1>replied,</mark1><br>
"Press this a little closer, sweet, <mark4>until--</mark4><br>
Come, I am hunger'd and <mark5>half-anger'd--meat,</mark5><br>
Wine, wine--and I will love thee to the <mark1>death,</mark1><br>
And out beyond into the dream to <mark1>come."</mark1><br>
<br>
So then, when both were brought to full <mark4>accord,</mark4><br>
She <mark4>rose</mark4>, and set before him all he <mark4>will'd;</mark4><br>
And after these had comforted the <mark1>blood</mark1><br>
With meats and wines, and satiated their <mark4>hearts--</mark4><br>
Now talking of their woodland <mark4>paradise,</mark4><br>
The deer, the dews, the fern, the founts, the <mark4>lawns;</mark4><br>
Now mocking at the much ungainliness, <br>
And craven shifts, and long crane legs of <mark1>Mark--</mark1><br>
Then Tristram laughing caught the harp, and <mark4>sang:</mark4><br>
<br>
"Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that bend the <mark4>brier!</mark4><br>
A star in heaven, a star within the <mark4>mere!</mark4><br>
Ay, ay, O ay--a star was my <mark3>desire,</mark3><br>
And one was far apart, and one was <mark3>near:</mark3><br>
Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that bow the <mark1>grass!</mark1><br>
And one was water and one star was <mark1>fire,</mark1><br>
And one will ever shine and one will <mark3>pass.</mark3><br>
Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that move the <mark1>mere."</mark1><br>
<br>
Then in the light's last glimmer Tristram <mark4>show'd</mark4><br>
And swung the ruby carcanet. She <mark1>cried,</mark1><br>
"The collar of some Order, which our <mark1>King</mark1><br>
Hath newly founded, all for thee, my <mark1>soul,</mark1><br>
For thee, to yield thee grace beyond thy <mark4>peers."</mark4><br>
<br>
"Not so, my Queen," he said, "but the red <mark4>fruit</mark4><br>
Grown on a magic oak-tree in <mark4>mid-heaven,</mark4><br>
And won by Tristram as a <mark1>tourney-prize,</mark1><br>
And hither brought by Tristram for his <mark1>last</mark1><br>
Love-offering and peace-offering unto <mark1>thee."</mark1><br>
<br>
He spoke, he turn'd, then, flinging round her <mark1>neck,</mark1><br>
Claspt it, and cried "Thine Order, O my <mark1>Queen!"</mark1><br>
<mark4>But</mark4>, while he bow'd to kiss the jewell'd <mark4>throat,</mark4><br>
Out of the dark, just as the lips had <mark4>touch'd,</mark4><br>
Behind him rose a shadow and a <mark4>shriek--</mark4><br>
"Mark's way," said Mark, and clove him thro' the <mark4>brain.</mark4><br>
<br>
That night came Arthur home, and while he <mark4>climb'd,</mark4><br>
All in a death-dumb autumn-dripping <mark4>gloom,</mark4><br>
The stairway to the hall, and look'd and <mark1>saw</mark1><br>
The great Queen's bower was dark,--about his <mark1>feet</mark1><br>
A voice clung sobbing till he question'd <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
"What art thou?" and the voice about his <mark1>feet</mark1><br>
Sent up an answer, sobbing, "I am thy <mark1>fool,</mark1><br>
And I shall never make thee smile <mark1>again."</mark1><br>
