Title : In Golden Gate Park That Day . . . <br>
Author : Lawrence Ferlinghetti <br><br>

In Golden Gate Park that day <br>
a man and his wife were coming <mark4>along</mark4><br>
thru the enormous <mark1>meadow</mark1><br>
which was the meadow of the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
He was wearing green <mark4>suspenders</mark4><br>
and carrying an old beat-up <mark4>flute</mark4><br>
in one <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
while his wife had a bunch of <mark4>grapes</mark4><br>
which she kept handing <mark4>out</mark4><br>
<br>
to various <mark4>squirrels</mark4><br>
                                                                           as if each   <br>
were a little <mark4>joke</mark4><br>
<br>
And then the two of them came <mark4>on</mark4><br>
thru the enormous <mark1>meadow</mark1><br>
which was the meadow of the <mark1>world</mark1><br>
and <mark4>then</mark4><br>
at a very still spot where the trees <mark4>dreamed</mark4><br>
and seemed to have been waiting thru all <mark4>time</mark4><br>
for <mark4>them</mark4><br>
they sat down together on the <mark4>grass</mark4><br>
without looking at each <mark1>other</mark1><br>
and ate <mark4>oranges</mark4><br>
without looking at each <mark1>other</mark1><br>
and put the <mark4>peels</mark4><br>
in a basket which they <mark3>seemed</mark3><br>
to have brought for that <mark4>purpose</mark4><br>
without looking at each <mark1>other</mark1><br>
<br>
And <mark1>then</mark1><br>
                  he took his shirt and undershirt off   <br>
but kept his hat <mark1>on</mark1><br>
<br>
and without saying <mark4>anything</mark4><br>
fell asleep under <mark4>it</mark4><br>
And his wife just sat there <mark4>looking</mark4><br>
at the birds which flew <mark4>about</mark4><br>
calling to each <mark1>other</mark1><br>
                           in the stilly air <br>
as if they were questioning <mark4>existence</mark4><br>
or trying to recall something <mark4>forgotten</mark4><br>
<br>
But then finally <br>
she too lay down <mark4>flat</mark4><br>
                                                and just lay there looking up   <br>
at <mark4>nothing</mark4><br>
yet fingering the old <mark1>flute</mark1><br>
which nobody <mark4>played</mark4><br>
and finally looking <mark4>over</mark4><br>
at <mark4>him</mark4><br>
without any particular <mark4>expression</mark4><br>
except a certain awful <mark4>look</mark4><br>
of terrible <mark3>depression</mark3><br>
