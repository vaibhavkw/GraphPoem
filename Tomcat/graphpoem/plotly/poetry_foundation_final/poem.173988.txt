<br>
Love, though for this you riddle me with <mark3>darts,</mark3><br>
And drag me at your chariot till I die, <mark3>?</mark3><br>
Oh, heavy prince! Oh, panderer of hearts! <mark3>?</mark3><br>
Yet hear me tell how in their throats they <mark3>lie</mark3><br>
Who shout you mighty: thick about my <mark3>hair,</mark3><br>
Day in, day out, your ominous arrows purr,<br>
Who still am free, unto no querulous <mark3>care</mark3><br>
A fool, and in no temple <mark4>worshiper!</mark4><br>
I, that have bared me to your quiver's <mark4>fire,</mark4><br>
Lifted my face into its puny <mark3>rain,</mark3><br>
Do wreathe you Impotent to Evoke <mark3>Desire</mark3><br>
As you are Powerless to Elicit <mark3>Pain!</mark3><br>
(Now will the god, for blasphemy so <mark3>brave,</mark3><br>
Punish me, surely, with the shaft I <mark3>crave!)</mark3><br>
<br>
I think I should have loved you presently,<br>
And given in earnest words I flung in <mark3>jest;</mark3><br>
And lifted honest eyes for you to <mark5>see,</mark5><br>
And caught your hand against my cheek and <mark3>breast;</mark3><br>
And all my pretty follies flung <mark3>aside</mark3><br>
That won you to me, and beneath your <mark3>gaze,</mark3><br>
Naked of reticence and shorn of <mark3>pride,</mark3><br>
Spread like a chart my little wicked <mark3>ways.</mark3><br>
I, that had been to you, had you <mark4>remained,</mark4><br>
But one more waking from a recurrent <mark3>dream,</mark3><br>
Cherish no less the certain stakes I <mark3>gained,</mark3><br>
And walk your memory's halls, austere, <mark3>supreme,</mark3><br>
A ghost in marble of a girl you <mark3>knew</mark3><br>
Who would have loved you in a day or <mark3>two.</mark3><br>
Oh, think not I am faithful to a <mark3>vow!</mark3><br>
<br>
Faithless am I save to love's self <mark4>alone.</mark4><br>
Were you not lovely I would leave you <mark3>now:</mark3><br>
After the feet of beauty fly my <mark3>own.</mark3><br>
Were you not still my hunger's rarest <mark4>food,</mark4><br>
And water ever to my wildest <mark4>thirst,</mark4><br>
I would desert you ? think not but I would! <mark4>?</mark4><br>
And seek another as I sought you <mark3>first.</mark3><br>
But you are mobile as the veering <mark4>air,</mark4><br>
And all your charms more changeful than the <mark4>tide,</mark4><br>
Wherefore to be inconstant is no <mark1>care:</mark1><br>
I have but to continue at your <mark3>side.</mark3><br>
So wanton, light and false, my love, are <mark3>you,</mark3><br>
I am most faithless when I most am <mark3>true.</mark3><br>
I shall forget you presently, my <mark4>dear,</mark4><br>
So make the most of this, your little <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
<br>
Your little month, your little half a <mark3>year,</mark3><br>
Ere I forget, or die, or move <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
And we are done forever; by and <mark3>by</mark3><br>
I shall forget you, as I said, but <mark1>now,</mark1><br>
If you entreat me with your loveliest <mark1>lie</mark1><br>
I will protest you with my favorite <mark1>vow.</mark1><br>
I would indeed that love were <mark4>longer-lived,</mark4><br>
And vows were not so brittle as they <mark4>are,</mark4><br>
But so it is, and nature has <mark3>contrived</mark3><br>
To struggle on without a break thus far, <mark3>?</mark3><br>
Whether or not we find what we are <mark5>seeking</mark5><br>
Is idle, biologically <mark3>speaking.</mark3><br>
