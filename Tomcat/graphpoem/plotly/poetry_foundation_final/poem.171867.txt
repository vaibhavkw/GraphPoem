Title : The Asians Dying <br>
Author : W. S. Merwin <br><br>

When the forests have been destroyed their darkness <mark4>remains</mark4><br>
The ash the great walker follows the possessors <br>
<br>
Nothing they will come to is real <br>
Nor for <mark4>long</mark4><br>
Over the watercourses <br>
Like ducks in the time of the ducks <br>
The ghosts of the villages trail in the sky <br>
Making a new <mark4>twilight</mark4><br>
<br>
Rain falls into the open eyes of the <mark4>dead</mark4><br>
Again again with its pointless <mark4>sound</mark4><br>
When the moon finds them they are the color of <mark4>everything</mark4><br>
<br>
The nights disappear like bruises but nothing is <mark4>healed</mark4><br>
The dead go away like <mark4>bruises</mark4><br>
The blood vanishes into the poisoned <mark4>farmlands</mark4><br>
Pain the horizon <br>
<br>
Overhead the seasons rock <br>
They are paper <mark4>bells</mark4><br>
Calling to nothing <mark4>living</mark4><br>
<br>
The possessors move everywhere under Death their star   <br>
Like columns of smoke they advance into the <mark4>shadows</mark4><br>
Like thin flames with no <mark4>light</mark4><br>
They with no <mark4>past</mark4><br>
And fire their only future<br>
