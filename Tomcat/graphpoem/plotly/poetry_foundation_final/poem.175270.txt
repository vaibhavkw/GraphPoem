Title : There may be Chaos still around the World <br>
Author : George Santayana <br><br>

There may be chaos still around the <mark3>world,</mark3><br>
This little world that in my thinking <mark3>lies;</mark3><br>
For mine own bosom is the paradise<br>
Where all my life's fair visions are <mark3>unfurled.</mark3><br>
Within my nature's shell I slumber <mark3>curled,</mark3><br>
Unmindful of the changing outer <mark3>skies,</mark3><br>
Where now, perchance, some new-born Eros <mark3>flies,</mark3><br>
Or some old Cronos from his throne is <mark3>hurled.</mark3><br>
I heed them <mark4>not</mark4>, or if the subtle <mark4>night</mark4><br>
Haunt me with deities I never <mark3>saw,</mark3><br>
I soon mine eyelid's drowsy curtain <mark3>draw</mark3><br>
To hide their myriad faces from my <mark3>sight.</mark3><br>
They threat in vain; the whirlwind cannot <mark3>awe</mark3><br>
A happy snow-flake dancing in the <mark3>flaw.</mark3><br>
