Title : A.M. Fog <br>
Author : Mark Jarman <br><br>

Night's afterbirth, last dream before <mark4>waking,</mark4><br>
Holding on with dissolving <mark4>hands,</mark4><br>
Out of it came, not a line of old <mark4>men,</mark4><br>
But pairs of headlights, delaying <mark4>morning.</mark4><br>
<br>
It felt like tears, like wetted <mark5>bedsheets,</mark5><br>
And suspended in it like a <mark4>medicine</mark4><br>
In vapor was the ocean's presence, <mark4>ghost</mark4><br>
Of deep water and the bite of <mark4>salt.</mark4><br>
<br>
Here you found your body <mark4>again,</mark4><br>
The hand before your face and the face it <mark4>touched,</mark4><br>
Eyes floating, feet on invisible <mark4>ground,</mark4><br>
Vagueness like another <mark4>skin.</mark4><br>
<br>
Sent out into it anyway, because it was <mark1>morning,</mark1><br>
To taste it, touch blind <mark4>hardness</mark4><br>
Like marble <mark4>ruins</mark4>, and skirt the <mark4>edges,</mark4><br>
Razors in goosedown, hydrants' <mark4>fists.</mark4><br>
<br>
Abruptly out of it waves <mark4>appeared,</mark4><br>
<br>
Transmuted from hanging silver ore, <mark4>crafted</mark4><br>
Before the eyes into curving <mark4>metals</mark4><br>
That broke into soup scum, Queen Anne's <mark4>lace.</mark4><br>
Out of a great nothing, a <mark4>theology.</mark4><br>
<br>
Out of the amorphous, an edgeless <mark4>body</mark4><br>
Or one like a hunting mass of tendrils <br>
That hurried down the sand, moved by hunger. <br>
I remember a gang of <mark4>friends</mark4><br>
<br>
Racing a fog bank's onslaught along the <mark5>beach.</mark5><br>
Seal-slick, warm from the <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
This thing would eat, they ran <mark4>laughing.</mark4><br>
The fog came on. And they were <mark5>beautiful,</mark5><br>
<br>
The three boys and one girl, still in her <mark4>wetsuit,</mark4><br>
And the dissolution overtaking <mark5>them,</mark5><br>
Their stridency, full of faith, still <mark4>audible.</mark4><br>
All morning bathed in a dovelike <mark4>brooding.</mark4><br>
<br>
The fog satisfied itself by <mark4>overwhelming</mark4><br>
<br>
The meagre dew, watering the <mark4>doors</mark4><br>
0f snails, the leeward mold, and held <mark4>still.</mark4><br>
And then near noon there was a <mark4>concentration</mark4><br>
As if the sky tried to find a slippery <mark4>word</mark4><br>
<br>
Or remember--that's right--remember <br>
Where it was in an unfamiliar <mark4>bedroom.</mark4><br>
And knew. And switched the light on. Wide awake. <br>
