Title : St. Peter Claver <br>
Author : Toi Derricotte <br><br>

Every town with black Catholics has a St. Peter Claver's.   <br>
My first was nursery school. <br>
Miss Maturin made us fold our towels in a regulation square and nap on army <mark4>cots.</mark4><br>
No mother questioned; no child sassed. <br>
In blue pleated skirts, <mark4>pants</mark4>, and white <mark4>shirts,</mark4><br>
we stood in line to use the open <mark4>toilets</mark4><br>
and conserved light by walking in <mark4>darkness.</mark4><br>
Unsmiling, mostly light-skinned, we were the children of the middle class, preparing to take our parents' places in a world that would demand we fold our hands and wait. <br>
They said it was good for us, the bowl of soup, its pasty <mark4>whiteness;</mark4><br>
I learned to swallow and distrust my senses. <br>
<br>
On holy cards St. Peter's face is olive-toned, his hair near kinky; <br>
I thought he was one of us who pass between the rich and poor, the light and <mark5>dark.</mark5><br>
Now I read he was "a Spanish Jesuit priest who labored for the salvation of the African Negroes and the abolition of the slave trade." <br>
I was tricked <mark4>again</mark4>, robbed of my <mark4>patron,</mark4><br>
and left with a debt to another white <mark4>man.</mark4><br>
