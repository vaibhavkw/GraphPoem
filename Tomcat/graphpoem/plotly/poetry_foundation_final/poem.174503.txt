Title : Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird <br>
Author : Wallace Stevens <br><br>

<br>
Among twenty snowy <mark4>mountains,</mark4><br>
The only moving <mark4>thing</mark4><br>
Was the eye of the <mark5>blackbird.</mark5><br>
<br>
I was of three <mark4>minds,</mark4><br>
Like a tree   <br>
In which there are three <mark4>blackbirds.</mark4><br>
The blackbird whirled in the autumn <mark4>winds.</mark4><br>
<br>
It was a small part of the <mark4>pantomime.</mark4><br>
A man and a <mark4>woman</mark4><br>
Are <mark4>one.</mark4><br>
<br>
A man and a woman and a <mark1>blackbird</mark1><br>
Are <mark1>one.</mark1><br>
I do not know which to prefer,   <br>
The beauty of <mark4>inflections</mark4><br>
Or the beauty of <mark4>innuendoes,</mark4><br>
<br>
The blackbird <mark4>whistling</mark4><br>
Or just <mark5>after.</mark5><br>
Icicles filled the long <mark5>window</mark5><br>
With barbaric <mark4>glass.</mark4><br>
The shadow of the <mark1>blackbird</mark1><br>
Crossed it, to and <mark3>fro.</mark3><br>
<br>
The <mark4>mood</mark4><br>
Traced in the <mark5>shadow</mark5><br>
An indecipherable <mark4>cause.</mark4><br>
O thin men of Haddam,   <br>
Why do you imagine golden <mark4>birds?</mark4><br>
Do you not see how the <mark1>blackbird</mark1><br>
Walks around the <mark4>feet</mark4><br>
Of the women about <mark3>you?</mark3><br>
<br>
I know noble <mark4>accents</mark4><br>
And lucid, inescapable <mark4>rhythms;</mark4><br>
But I know, <mark3>too,</mark3><br>
That the blackbird is <mark4>involved</mark4><br>
In what I <mark3>know.</mark3><br>
When the blackbird flew out of <mark4>sight,</mark4><br>
<br>
It marked the edge   <br>
Of one of many <mark4>circles.</mark4><br>
At the sight of <mark1>blackbirds</mark1><br>
Flying in a green <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
Even the bawds of <mark4>euphony</mark4><br>
Would cry out <mark4>sharply.</mark4><br>
<br>
He rode over <mark4>Connecticut</mark4><br>
In a glass coach.   <br>
Once, a fear pierced <mark4>him,</mark4><br>
In that he mistook   <br>
<br>
The shadow of his equipage   <br>
For <mark1>blackbirds.</mark1><br>
The river is <mark4>moving.</mark4><br>
The blackbird must be <mark4>flying.</mark4><br>
It was evening all <mark4>afternoon.</mark4><br>
<br>
It was <mark4>snowing</mark4><br>
And it was going to <mark3>snow.</mark3><br>
The blackbird <mark4>sat</mark4><br>
In the <mark4>cedar-limbs.</mark4><br>
