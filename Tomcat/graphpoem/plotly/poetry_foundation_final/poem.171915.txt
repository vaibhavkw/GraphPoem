Title : Near the Desert Test Sites (Palm Desert, California) <br>
Author : Sherod Santos <br><br>

--for Logan and Renee <mark4>Jenkins</mark4><br>
Unlike almost <mark4>everything</mark4><br>
Else just surviving <mark4>here</mark4><br>
In summer, poison <mark4>flowers</mark4><br>
Flourish in this <mark4>sweltering</mark4><br>
Heat, tangling like <mark4>blown</mark4><br>
Litter in fences <mark4>around</mark4><br>
The trailer parks and <mark5>motel</mark5><br>
<mark4>Pools</mark4>, and turning the <mark4>islands</mark4><br>
Pinkish-white <mark4>between</mark4><br>
Divided lanes of freeway,   <br>
Where all day long <mark4>against</mark4><br>
The burnished hubbub of U- <br>
Haul trucks and <mark4>automobiles,</mark4><br>
Off-the-road vehicles <mark4>and</mark4><br>
Campers, the oleander <mark4>shakes</mark4><br>
Its brightly polished <mark4>pocket-</mark4><br>
Knives, as at the <mark4>motorcade</mark4><br>
Of some ambassador <mark4>hurrying</mark4><br>
Through a village of the <mark4>poor.</mark4><br>
And every day by late <mark4>after-</mark4><br>
Noon the overwatered <mark4>lawns</mark4><br>
Around the shopping <mark4>mall</mark4><br>
Still burn off brown, <mark4>their</mark4><br>
Pampered opulence <mark4>upbraided</mark4><br>
By the palms' <mark4>insomniac</mark4><br>
Vision of one ineffable apoc- <br>
Alyptic noon. But the <mark4>smell</mark4><br>
Is somehow sweeter <mark4>than</mark4><br>
That makes you think, a dry   <br>
Lemon-sweetness, as if <mark3>some-</mark3><br>
Where nearby wild verbena <br>
Has been forced to leaf <br>
By a match held up to each   <br>
Bud--and the <mark4>silo-skyscraper</mark4><br>
Holiday Inn at the <mark4>famous</mark4><br>
Resort "Where the <mark4>Horizon</mark4><br>
Ends" could almost be <mark4>that</mark4><br>
Match the way the <mark4>heat</mark4><br>
Sloughs off it like <mark1>after-</mark1><br>
Burn. And yet, <mark4>because</mark4><br>
Of the way the sun <mark4>in-</mark4><br>
Tensifies everything, <mark4>one</mark4><br>
Always has the feeling <mark2>there</mark2><br>
Is much less here than <mark4>meets</mark4><br>
The eye: the halcyon <mark4>blink</mark4><br>
Of a shard of glass, a <mark4>Lear-</mark4><br>
Jet wafted into vapor <mark4>out</mark4><br>
On the tarmac's run, the way   <br>
Common quartzstone <mark4>gives</mark4><br>
Off heat which seems to <mark3>come</mark3><br>
From inside itself, and <mark4>not,</mark4><br>
In fact, from that <mark4>more-</mark4><br>
Than-imaginably-nuclear <mark3>sun</mark3><br>
Which every morning <mark4>starts</mark4><br>
Up so illusionless, and <mark5>every</mark5><br>
Evening <mark4>slow-dissolves</mark4><br>
On the blue and <mark4>otherwise</mark4><br>
Planetary hills, like a <mark4>Valium</mark4><br>
Breaking up on the <mark4>tongue.</mark4><br>
