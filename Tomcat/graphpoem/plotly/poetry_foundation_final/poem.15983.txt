Title : Autopsychography<br>
Author : Fernando Pessoa<br><br>

The poet is a man who feigns <br>
And feigns so thoroughly, at <mark4>last</mark4><br>
He manages to feign as pain <br>
The pain he really <mark4>feels,</mark4><br>
<br>
And those who read what once he <mark4>wrote</mark4><br>
Feel clearly, in the pain they read,<br>
Neither of the pains he <mark4>felt,</mark4><br>
Only a pain they cannot sense.<br>
<br>
And thus, around its jolting track <br>
There runs, to keep our reason busy, <br>
The circling clockwork train of <mark4>ours</mark4><br>
That men agree to call a <mark4>heart.</mark4><br>
