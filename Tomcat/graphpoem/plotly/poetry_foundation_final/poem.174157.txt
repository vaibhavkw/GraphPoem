Title : Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady <br>
Author : Alexander Pope <br><br>

What beck'ning ghost, along the moon-light <mark3>shade</mark3><br>
Invites my steps, and points to yonder <mark3>glade?</mark3><br>
'Tis she!?but why that bleeding bosom gor'd,<br>
Why dimly gleams the visionary <mark4>sword?</mark4><br>
Oh ever beauteous, ever friendly! <mark3>tell,</mark3><br>
Is it, in heav'n, a crime to love too <mark3>well?</mark3><br>
To bear too tender, or too firm a <mark3>heart,</mark3><br>
To act a lover's or a Roman's <mark3>part?</mark3><br>
Is there no bright reversion in the <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
For those who greatly think, or bravely <mark3>die?</mark3><br>
<br>
Why bade ye else, ye pow'rs! her soul <mark4>aspire</mark4><br>
Above the vulgar flight of low desire?<br>
Ambition first sprung from your blest abodes;<br>
The glorious fault of angels and of <mark4>gods;</mark4><br>
Thence to their images on earth it <mark4>flows,</mark4><br>
And in the breasts of kings and heroes <mark3>glows.</mark3><br>
Most souls, 'tis true, but peep out once an <mark3>age,</mark3><br>
Dull sullen pris'ners in the body's <mark3>cage:</mark3><br>
Dim lights of life, that burn a length of <mark4>years</mark4><br>
Useless, unseen, as lamps in sepulchres;<br>
Like eastern kings a lazy state they <mark3>keep,</mark3><br>
And close confin'd to their own palace, <mark3>sleep.</mark3><br>
<br>
From these perhaps (ere nature bade her <mark1>die)</mark1><br>
Fate snatch'd her early to the pitying <mark1>sky.</mark1><br>
As into air the purer spirits <mark5>flow,</mark5><br>
And sep'rate from their kindred dregs <mark3>below;</mark3><br>
So flew the soul to its congenial <mark3>place,</mark3><br>
Nor left one virtue to redeem her <mark3>race.</mark3><br>
<br>
But thou, false guardian of a charge too <mark4>good,</mark4><br>
Thou, mean deserter of thy brother's <mark4>blood!</mark4><br>
See on these ruby lips the trembling <mark3>breath,</mark3><br>
These cheeks now fading at the blast of <mark3>death:</mark3><br>
Cold is that breast which warm'd the world <mark4>before,</mark4><br>
And those love-darting eyes must roll no <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
Thus, if eternal justice rules the <mark4>ball,</mark4><br>
Thus shall your wives, and thus your children <mark3>fall;</mark3><br>
On all the line a sudden vengeance <mark4>waits,</mark4><br>
And frequent hearses shall besiege your <mark3>gates.</mark3><br>
There passengers shall stand, and pointing <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
(While the long fun'rals blacken all the <mark3>way)</mark3><br>
"Lo these were they, whose souls the furies <mark4>steel'd,</mark4><br>
And curs'd with hearts unknowing how to <mark4>yield.</mark4><br>
Thus unlamented pass the proud <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
The gaze of fools, and pageant of a <mark3>day!</mark3><br>
So perish all, whose breast ne'er learn'd to <mark3>glow</mark3><br>
For others' good, or melt at others' <mark3>woe."</mark3><br>
<br>
What can atone (oh ever-injur'd <mark1>shade!)</mark1><br>
Thy fate unpitied, and thy rites <mark3>unpaid?</mark3><br>
No friend's complaint, no kind domestic <mark4>tear</mark4><br>
Pleas'd thy pale ghost, or grac'd thy mournful <mark4>bier.</mark4><br>
By foreign hands thy dying eyes were <mark4>clos'd,</mark4><br>
By foreign hands thy decent limbs compos'd,<br>
By foreign hands thy humble grave <mark4>adorn'd,</mark4><br>
By strangers <mark4>honour'd</mark4>, and by strangers <mark3>mourn'd!</mark3><br>
What though no friends in sable weeds <mark4>appear,</mark4><br>
Grieve for an hour, perhaps, then mourn a <mark3>year,</mark3><br>
And bear about the mockery of <mark1>woe</mark1><br>
To midnight dances, and the public <mark3>show?</mark3><br>
What though no weeping loves thy ashes <mark4>grace,</mark4><br>
Nor polish'd marble emulate thy <mark3>face?</mark3><br>
What though no sacred earth allow thee <mark3>room,</mark3><br>
Nor hallow'd dirge be mutter'd o'er thy <mark3>tomb?</mark3><br>
Yet shall thy grave with rising flow'rs be drest,<br>
And the green turf lie lightly on thy <mark4>breast:</mark4><br>
There shall the morn her earliest tears <mark3>bestow,</mark3><br>
There the first roses of the year shall <mark3>blow;</mark3><br>
While angels with their silver wings <mark4>o'ershade</mark4><br>
The <mark4>ground</mark4>, now sacred by thy reliques <mark3>made.</mark3><br>
<br>
So peaceful rests, without a stone, a <mark4>name,</mark4><br>
What once had beauty, titles, wealth, and <mark3>fame.</mark3><br>
How lov'd, how honour'd once, avails thee <mark4>not,</mark4><br>
To whom related, or by whom <mark4>begot;</mark4><br>
A heap of dust alone remains of <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
'Tis all thou art, and all the proud shall <mark3>be!</mark3><br>
<br>
Poets themselves must fall, like those they <mark3>sung,</mark3><br>
Deaf the prais'd ear, and mute the tuneful <mark3>tongue.</mark3><br>
Ev'n he, whose soul now melts in mournful <mark4>lays,</mark4><br>
Shall shortly want the gen'rous tear he <mark3>pays;</mark3><br>
Then from his closing eyes thy form shall <mark1>part,</mark1><br>
And the last pang shall tear thee from his <mark1>heart,</mark1><br>
Life's idle business at one gasp be <mark4>o'er,</mark4><br>
The Muse forgot, and thou belov'd no <mark1>more!</mark1><br>
