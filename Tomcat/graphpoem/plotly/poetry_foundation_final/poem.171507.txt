Title : After Arguing against the Contention That Art Must Come from Discontent <br>
Author : William E. Stafford <br><br>

Whispering to each handhold, "I'll be <mark4>back,"</mark4><br>
I go up the cliff in the dark. One place   <br>
I loosen a rock and listen a long <mark3>time</mark3><br>
till it hits, faint in the gulf, but the rush <br>
of the torrent almost drowns it out, and the <mark4>wind--</mark4><br>
I almost forgot the wind: it tears at your <mark4>side</mark4><br>
or it waits and then buffets; you sag outward. . . <mark4>.</mark4><br>
<br>
I remember they said it would be hard. I scramble   <br>
by luck into a little pocket out of <br>
the wind and begin to beat on the <mark4>stones</mark4><br>
with my scratched numb hands, rocking back and forth <br>
in silent laughter there in the <mark4>dark--</mark4><br>
"Made it again!" Oh how I love this <mark3>climb!</mark3><br>
--the whispering to stones, the drag, the <mark4>weight</mark4><br>
as your muscles crack and ease on, working   <br>
right. They are back there, <mark4>discontent,</mark4><br>
waiting to be driven forth. I <mark4>pound</mark4><br>
on the earth, riding the earth past the <mark4>stars:</mark4><br>
"Made it again! Made it again!"<br>
