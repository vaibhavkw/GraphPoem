Title : Queens <br>
Author : J. M. Synge <br><br>

Seven dog-days we let pass <br>
Naming Queens in Glenmacnass, <br>
All the rare and royal <mark4>names</mark4><br>
Wormy sheepskin yet <mark4>retains,</mark4><br>
Etain, Helen, Maeve, and Fand, <br>
Golden Deirdre's tender hand, <br>
Bert, the big-foot, sung by Villon, <br>
Cassandra, Ronsard found in <mark4>Lyon.</mark4><br>
Queens of Sheba, Meath and <mark4>Connaught,</mark4><br>
Coifed with crown, or gaudy <mark4>bonnet,</mark4><br>
Queens whose finger once did stir <mark4>men,</mark4><br>
Queens were eaten of fleas and <mark4>vermin,</mark4><br>
Queens men drew like Monna <mark3>Lisa,</mark3><br>
Or slew with drugs in Rome and <mark3>Pisa,</mark3><br>
We named Lucrezia <mark3>Crivelli,</mark3><br>
And Titian's lady with amber <mark3>belly,</mark3><br>
Queens acquainted in learned <mark4>sin,</mark4><br>
Jane of Jewry's slender <mark3>shin:</mark3><br>
Queens who cut the bogs of Glanna, <br>
Judith of Scripture, and <mark4>Gloriana,</mark4><br>
Queens who wasted the East by <mark4>proxy,</mark4><br>
Or drove the ass-cart, a tinker's <mark3>doxy,</mark3><br>
Yet these are rotten -- I ask their pardon <mark4>--</mark4><br>
And we've the sun on rock and <mark3>garden,</mark3><br>
These are <mark4>rotten</mark4>, so you're the <mark4>Queen</mark4><br>
Of all the living, or have <mark4>been.</mark4><br>
