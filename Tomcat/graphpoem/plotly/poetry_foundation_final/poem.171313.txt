Title : Sonnet #10 <br>
Author : Hayden Carruth <br><br>

You rose from our embrace and the small light <mark4>spread</mark4><br>
like an aureole around you. The long parabola <br>
of neck and shoulder, flank and thigh I <mark3>saw</mark3><br>
permute itself through unfolding and <mark4>unlimited</mark4><br>
minuteness in the movement of your tall <mark4>tread,</mark4><br>
the spine-root swaying, the Picasso-like eclat <br>
of scissoring slender legs. I knew some <mark3>law</mark3><br>
of Being was at work. At one time I had <mark3>said</mark3><br>
that love bestows such <mark4>values</mark4>, and so it <mark4>does,</mark4><br>
but the old man in his canto was right and <mark4>wise:</mark4><br>
ubi amor ibi ocullus <mark3>est.</mark3><br>
Always I wanted to give and in wanting <mark4>was</mark4><br>
the poet. A man now, aging, I know the <mark3>best</mark3><br>
of love is not to bestow, but to <mark4>recognize.</mark4><br>
