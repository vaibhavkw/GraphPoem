Title : Statement with Rhymes<br>
Author : Weldon Kees<br><br>

Plurality is all. I walk among the restaurants,   <br>
the theatres, the grocery <mark4>stores</mark4>, I ride the <mark4>cars</mark4><br>
and hear of Mrs. Bedford's teeth and Albuquerque,   <br>
strikes unsettled, someone's simply marvelous date,   <br>
news of the German <mark4>Jews</mark4>, the baseball <mark4>scores,</mark4><br>
storetalk and whoretalk, talk of wars. I turn   <br>
the pages of a thousand books to <mark4>read</mark4><br>
the names of Buddha, Malthus, Walker Evans, Stendhal, Andre Gide, <br>
Ouspenski; note the terms: obscurantism,   <br>
factorize, fagaceous, endocarp; <mark4>descend</mark4><br>
the nervous stairs to hear the broken <mark4>ends</mark4><br>
of songs that float through city air. <br>
In Osnabruck and Ogden, on the Passamaquoddy <mark3>Bay,</mark3><br>
in Ahmednagar, Waco (Neb.), in Santa <mark3>Fe,</mark3><br>
propelled by zeros, zinc, and zephyrs, always I'm <mark4>pursued</mark4><br>
by thoughts of what I am, authority, remembrance, <mark3>food,</mark3><br>
the letter on the mezzanine, the unemployed, dogs' lonely faces, pianos and <mark3>decay.</mark3><br>
<br>
Plurality is all. I sympathize, but cannot <mark3>grieve</mark3><br>
too long for those who wear their dialectics on their <mark4>sleeves.</mark4><br>
The pattern's one I sometimes rather like; there's really nothing <mark3>wrong</mark3><br>
with it for some. But I should add: It doesn't wear for <mark3>long,</mark3><br>
before I push the elevator bell and quickly <mark3>leave.</mark3><br>
