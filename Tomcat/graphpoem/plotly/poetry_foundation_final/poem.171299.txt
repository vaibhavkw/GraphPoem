Title : Summer near the River <br>
Author : Carolyn Kizer <br><br>

themes from the Tzu Yeh and the Book of <mark4>Songs</mark4><br>
I have carried my pillow to the <mark5>windowsill</mark5><br>
And try to sleep, with my damp arms crossed upon <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
But no breeze stirs the tepid <mark4>morning.</mark4><br>
Only I stir ... Come, tease me a little! <br>
With such cold passion, so little teasing play, <br>
How long can we endure our life <mark4>together?</mark4><br>
<br>
No use. I put on your long <mark4>dressing-gown;</mark4><br>
The untied sash trails over the dusty <mark4>floor.</mark4><br>
I kneel by the window, prop up your shaving <mark4>mirror</mark4><br>
And pluck my <mark4>eyebrows.</mark4><br>
I don't care if the robe slides <mark4>open</mark4><br>
Revealing a crescent of belly, a tan <mark3>thigh.</mark3><br>
I can accuse that nonexistent breeze <mark4>...</mark4><br>
<br>
I am as monogamous as the North <mark4>Star,</mark4><br>
But I don't want you to know it. You'd only take advantage.   <br>
While you are as fickle as spring <mark4>sunlight.</mark4><br>
All right, sleep! The cat means more to you than <mark3>I.</mark3><br>
I can rouse you, but then you swagger <mark4>out.</mark4><br>
I glimpse you from the window, striding toward the <mark4>river.</mark4><br>
<br>
When you return, reeking of fish and <mark4>beer,</mark4><br>
There is salt dew in your hair. Where have you <mark4>been?</mark4><br>
Your clothes weren't that wrinkled hours ago, when you <mark4>left.</mark4><br>
You couldn't have loved someone else, after loving me! <br>
I sulk and sigh, dawdling by the <mark5>window.</mark5><br>
Later, when you hold me in your <mark4>arms</mark4><br>
It seems, for a moment, the river ceases <mark4>flowing.</mark4><br>
