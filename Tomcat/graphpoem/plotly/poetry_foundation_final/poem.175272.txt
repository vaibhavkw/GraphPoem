<br>
Calm was the sea to which your course you <mark3>kept,</mark3><br>
Oh, how much calmer than all southern <mark3>seas!</mark3><br>
Many your nameless mates, whom the keen <mark3>breeze</mark3><br>
Wafted from mothers that of old have <mark3>wept.</mark3><br>
All souls of children taken as they <mark3>slept</mark3><br>
Are your <mark4>companions</mark4>, partners of your <mark3>ease,</mark3><br>
And the green souls of all these autumn <mark3>trees</mark3><br>
Are with you through the silent spaces <mark3>swept.</mark3><br>
Your virgin body gave its gentle <mark5>breath</mark5><br>
Untainted to the gods. Why should we <mark4>grieve,</mark4><br>
But that we merit not your holy <mark3>death?</mark3><br>
We shall not loiter long, your friends and <mark3>I;</mark3><br>
Living you made it goodlier to <mark4>live,</mark4><br>
Dead you will make it easier to <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
With you a part of me hath passed <mark3>away;</mark3><br>
<br>
For in the peopled forest of my <mark3>mind</mark3><br>
<br>
A tree made leafless by this wintry <mark3>wind</mark3><br>
Shall never don again its green <mark3>array.</mark3><br>
Chapel and fireside, country road and <mark3>bay,</mark3><br>
Have something of their friendliness <mark3>resigned;</mark3><br>
Another, if I <mark4>would</mark4>, I could not <mark3>find,</mark3><br>
And I am grown much older in a <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
But yet I treasure in my <mark4>memory</mark4><br>
Your gift of charity, your mellow <mark1>ease,</mark1><br>
And the dear honour of your <mark4>amity;</mark4><br>
For these once mine, my life is rich with <mark3>these.</mark3><br>
And I scarce know which part may greater <mark4>be,--</mark4><br>
What I keep of you, or you rob of <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
Your bark lies anchored in the peaceful <mark4>bight</mark4><br>
Until a kinder wind unfurl her <mark3>sail;</mark3><br>
<br>
Your docile spirit, winged by this <mark3>gale,</mark3><br>
<br>
Hath at the dawning fled into the <mark3>light.</mark3><br>
And I half know why heaven deemed it <mark3>right</mark3><br>
Your youth, and this my joy in youth, should <mark3>fail;</mark3><br>
God hath them <mark4>still</mark4>, for ever they <mark3>avail,</mark3><br>
Eternity hath borrowed that <mark3>delight.</mark3><br>
For long ago I taught my thoughts to <mark3>run</mark3><br>
Where all the great things live that lived of <mark3>yore,</mark3><br>
And in eternal quiet float and <mark3>soar;</mark3><br>
There all my loves are gathered into <mark3>one,</mark3><br>
Where change is not, nor parting any <mark3>more,</mark3><br>
Nor revolution of the moon and <mark3>sun.</mark3><br>
In my deep heart these chimes would still have <mark5>rung</mark5><br>
To toll your passing, had you not been <mark4>dead;</mark4><br>
For time a sadder mask than death may <mark3>spread</mark3><br>
<br>
Over the face that ever should be <mark3>young.</mark3><br>
<br>
The bough that falls with all its trophies <mark3>hung</mark3><br>
Falls not too soon, but lays its flower-crowned <mark3>head</mark3><br>
Most royal in the dust, with no leaf <mark3>shed</mark3><br>
Unhallowed or unchiselled or <mark3>unsung.</mark3><br>
And though the after world will never <mark4>hear</mark4><br>
The happy name of one so gently <mark3>true,</mark3><br>
Nor chronicles write large this fatal <mark4>year,</mark4><br>
Yet we who loved <mark3>you</mark3>, though we be but <mark3>few,</mark3><br>
Keep you in whatsoe'er is good, and <mark3>rear</mark3><br>
In our weak virtues monuments to <mark3>you.</mark3><br>
