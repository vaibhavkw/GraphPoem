Title : To the Rose upon the Rood of Time <br>
Author : William Butler Yeats <br><br>

Red <mark4>Rose</mark4>, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my <mark4>days!</mark4><br>
Come near me, while I sing the ancient <mark3>ways:</mark3><br>
Cuchulain battling with the bitter <mark3>tide;</mark3><br>
The Druid, grey, <mark4>wood-nurtured</mark4>, <mark3>quiet-eyed,</mark3><br>
Who cast round Fergus dreams, and ruin <mark4>untold;</mark4><br>
And thine own sadness, whereof stars, grown <mark3>old</mark3><br>
In dancing silver-sandalled on the sea,   <br>
Sing in their high and lonely melody.   <br>
Come near, that no more blinded by man's <mark3>fate,</mark3><br>
I find under the boughs of love and <mark3>hate,</mark3><br>
In all poor foolish things that live a <mark5>day,</mark5><br>
Eternal beauty wandering on her <mark3>way.</mark3><br>
<br>
Come near, come near, come near--Ah, leave me <mark3>still</mark3><br>
A little space for the rose-breath to <mark3>fill!</mark3><br>
Lest I no more hear common things that <mark3>crave;</mark3><br>
The weak worm hiding down in its small <mark3>cave,</mark3><br>
The field-mouse running by me in the <mark3>grass,</mark3><br>
And heavy mortal hopes that toil and <mark3>pass;</mark3><br>
But seek alone to hear the strange things <mark4>said</mark4><br>
By God to the bright hearts of those long <mark3>dead,</mark3><br>
And learn to chaunt a tongue men do not <mark3>know.</mark3><br>
Come near; I would, before my time to <mark3>go,</mark3><br>
Sing of old Eire and the ancient <mark1>ways:</mark1><br>
Red <mark4>Rose</mark4>, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my <mark1>days.</mark1><br>
