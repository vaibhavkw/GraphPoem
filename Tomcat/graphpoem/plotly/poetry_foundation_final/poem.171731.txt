Title : Lilacs <br>
Author : Amy Lowell <br><br>

<br>
False <mark3>blue,</mark3><br>
<br>
Color of <mark1>lilac,</mark1><br>
Your great puffs of <mark4>flowers</mark4><br>
Are everywhere in this my New <mark4>England.</mark4><br>
Among your heart-shaped <mark4>leaves</mark4><br>
Orange orioles hop like music-box birds and <mark4>sing</mark4><br>
Their little weak soft <mark4>songs;</mark4><br>
In the crooks of your <mark4>branches</mark4><br>
The bright eyes of song sparrows sitting on spotted <mark4>eggs</mark4><br>
Peer restlessly through the light and shadow   <br>
Of all <mark4>Springs.</mark4><br>
Lilacs in <mark5>dooryards</mark5><br>
Holding quiet conversations with an early <mark4>moon;</mark4><br>
Lilacs watching a deserted <mark4>house</mark4><br>
Settling sideways into the grass of an old <mark4>road;</mark4><br>
Lilacs, wind-beaten, staggering under a lopsided shock of <mark5>bloom</mark5><br>
Above a cellar dug into a <mark4>hill.</mark4><br>
You are <mark1>everywhere.</mark1><br>
You were <mark1>everywhere.</mark1><br>
You tapped the window when the preacher preached his <mark4>sermon,</mark4><br>
And ran along the road beside the boy going to <mark4>school.</mark4><br>
You stood by the pasture-bars to give the cows good <mark4>milking,</mark4><br>
You persuaded the housewife that her dishpan was of <mark4>silver.</mark4><br>
And her husband an image of pure <mark4>gold.</mark4><br>
You flaunted the fragrance of your <mark4>blossoms</mark4><br>
Through the wide doors of Custom <mark4>Houses--</mark4><br>
You, and sandal-wood, and <mark3>tea,</mark3><br>
Charging the noses of quill-driving <mark4>clerks</mark4><br>
When a ship was in from China. <br>
You called to them: "Goose-quill <mark1>men</mark1>, goose-quill <mark4>men,</mark4><br>
May is a month for <mark4>flitting."</mark4><br>
Until they writhed on their high <mark4>stools</mark4><br>
And wrote poetry on their letter-sheets behind the propped-up <mark4>ledgers.</mark4><br>
Paradoxical New England <mark1>clerks,</mark1><br>
Writing inventories in ledgers, reading the "Song of Solomon" at <mark5>night,</mark5><br>
So many verses before <mark4>bed-time,</mark4><br>
Because it was the <mark4>Bible.</mark4><br>
The dead fed <mark3>you</mark3><br>
Amid the slant stones of <mark4>graveyards.</mark4><br>
Pale ghosts who planted <mark1>you</mark1><br>
Came in the <mark3>nighttime</mark3><br>
And let their thin hair blow through your clustered <mark4>stems.</mark4><br>
You are of the green <mark3>sea,</mark3><br>
And of the stone hills which reach a long <mark4>distance.</mark4><br>
You are of elm-shaded streets with little shops where they sell kites and <mark4>marbles,</mark4><br>
You are of great parks where every one walks and nobody is at <mark4>home.</mark4><br>
You cover the blind sides of <mark4>greenhouses</mark4><br>
And lean over the top to say a hurry-word through the <mark4>glass</mark4><br>
To your friends, the grapes, <mark4>inside.</mark4><br>
False <mark1>blue,</mark1><br>
<br>
Color of <mark1>lilac,</mark1><br>
You have forgotten your Eastern <mark4>origin,</mark4><br>
<br>
The veiled women with eyes like <mark4>panthers,</mark4><br>
The swollen, aggressive turbans of jeweled pashas. <br>
Now you are a very decent <mark4>flower,</mark4><br>
A reticent <mark1>flower,</mark1><br>
A curiously clear-cut, candid <mark1>flower,</mark1><br>
Standing beside clean <mark4>doorways,</mark4><br>
Friendly to a house-cat and a pair of <mark4>spectacles,</mark4><br>
Making poetry out of a bit of <mark4>moonlight</mark4><br>
And a hundred or two sharp <mark1>blossoms.</mark1><br>
Maine knows <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
Has for years and <mark4>years;</mark4><br>
New Hampshire knows <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
And <mark4>Massachusetts</mark4><br>
And <mark4>Vermont.</mark4><br>
Cape Cod starts you along the beaches to Rhode <mark4>Island;</mark4><br>
Connecticut takes you from a river to the <mark1>sea.</mark1><br>
You are brighter than <mark4>apples,</mark4><br>
Sweeter than <mark4>tulips,</mark4><br>
You are the great flood of our <mark4>souls</mark4><br>
Bursting above the leaf-shapes of our <mark4>hearts,</mark4><br>
You are the smell of all <mark4>Summers,</mark4><br>
The love of wives and <mark4>children,</mark4><br>
The recollection of gardens of little <mark1>children,</mark1><br>
You are State Houses and <mark4>Charters</mark4><br>
And the familiar treading of the foot to and fro on a road it <mark4>knows.</mark4><br>
May is lilac here in New <mark1>England,</mark1><br>
May is a thrush singing "Sun up!" on a tip-top ash <mark3>tree,</mark3><br>
May is white clouds behind <mark4>pine-trees</mark4><br>
Puffed out and marching upon a blue sky.   <br>
May is a green as no <mark4>other,</mark4><br>
May is much sun through small <mark1>leaves,</mark1><br>
May is soft earth, <br>
And <mark4>apple-blossoms,</mark4><br>
And windows open to a South <mark4>Wind.</mark4><br>
May is full light wind of <mark1>lilac</mark1><br>
From Canada to Narragansett Bay. <br>
False <mark1>blue,</mark1><br>
Color of <mark1>lilac.</mark1><br>
Heart-leaves of lilac all over New <mark1>England,</mark1><br>
<br>
Roots of lilac under all the soil of New <mark1>England,</mark1><br>
Lilac in me because I am New <mark1>England,</mark1><br>
<br>
Because my roots are in <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
Because my leaves are of <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
Because my flowers are for <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
Because it is my country <br>
And I speak to it of itself <br>
And sing of it with my own <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
Since certainly it is <mark4>mine.</mark4><br>
