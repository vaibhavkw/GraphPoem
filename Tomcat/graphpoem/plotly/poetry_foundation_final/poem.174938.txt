Title : The Last Bargain <br>
Author : Rabindranath Tagore <br><br>

"Come and hire me," I <mark4>cried</mark4>, while in the morning I was walking on the stone-paved <mark4>road.</mark4><br>
Sword in hand, the King came in his <mark1>chariot.</mark1><br>
He held my hand and said, "I will hire you with my power."<br>
But his power counted for nought, and he went away in his <mark1>chariot.</mark1><br>
<br>
In the heat of the midday the houses stood with shut <mark4>doors.</mark4><br>
I wandered along the crooked <mark4>lane.</mark4><br>
An old man came out with his bag of <mark4>gold.</mark4><br>
He pondered and said, "I will hire you with my money."<br>
He weighed his coins one by one, but I turned away.<br>
<br>
It was evening. The garden hedge was all aflower.<br>
The fair maid came out and said, "I will hire you with a smile."<br>
Her smile paled and melted into tears, and she went back alone into the dark.<br>
<br>
The sun glistened on the sand, and the sea waves broke waywardly.<br>
A child sat playing with <mark4>shells.</mark4><br>
He raised his head and seemed to know me, and said, "I hire you with nothing."<br>
From thenceforward that bargain struck in child's play made me a free <mark4>man.</mark4><br>
