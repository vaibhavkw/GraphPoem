Title : Stanzas Written in Dejection, near Naples <br>
Author : Percy Bysshe Shelley <br><br>

The sun is warm, the sky is <mark4>clear,</mark4><br>
The waves are dancing fast and <mark3>bright,</mark3><br>
Blue isles and snowy mountains <mark4>wear</mark4><br>
The purple noon's transparent <mark3>might,</mark3><br>
The breath of the moist earth is <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
Around its unexpanded <mark3>buds;</mark3><br>
Like many a voice of one <mark3>delight,</mark3><br>
The winds, the <mark4>birds</mark4>, the ocean <mark3>floods,</mark3><br>
The City's voice itself, is soft like <mark4>Solitude's.</mark4><br>
<br>
I see the Deep's untrampled <mark4>floor</mark4><br>
         With green and purple seaweeds strown; <br>
I see the waves upon the <mark3>shore,</mark3><br>
Like light dissolved in star-showers, <mark3>thrown:</mark3><br>
I sit upon the sands <mark3>alone,--</mark3><br>
The lightning of the noontide <mark4>ocean</mark4><br>
Is flashing round me, and a <mark4>tone</mark4><br>
Arises from its measured <mark4>motion,</mark4><br>
How sweet! did any heart now share in my <mark3>emotion.</mark3><br>
<br>
Alas! I have nor hope nor <mark3>health,</mark3><br>
Nor peace within nor calm <mark4>around,</mark4><br>
Nor that content surpassing <mark3>wealth</mark3><br>
The sage in meditation <mark3>found,</mark3><br>
And walked with inward glory <mark3>crowned--</mark3><br>
Nor fame, nor power, nor love, nor <mark3>leisure.</mark3><br>
Others I see whom these <mark3>surround--</mark3><br>
Smiling they live, and call life <mark3>pleasure;</mark3><br>
To me that cup has been dealt in another <mark3>measure.</mark3><br>
<br>
Yet now despair itself is <mark4>mild,</mark4><br>
Even as the winds and waters <mark3>are;</mark3><br>
I could lie down like a tired <mark3>child,</mark3><br>
And weep away the life of <mark4>care</mark4><br>
Which I have borne and yet must <mark3>bear,</mark3><br>
Till death like sleep might steal on <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
And I might feel in the warm <mark3>air</mark3><br>
My cheek grow cold, and hear the <mark3>sea</mark3><br>
Breathe o'er my dying brain its last monotony. <br>
<br>
Some might lament that I were <mark4>cold,</mark4><br>
As I, when this sweet day is <mark4>gone,</mark4><br>
Which my lost heart, too soon grown <mark3>old,</mark3><br>
Insults with this untimely <mark4>moan;</mark4><br>
They might lament--for I am <mark4>one</mark4><br>
Whom men love not,--and yet <mark4>regret,</mark4><br>
Unlike this day, which, when the <mark3>sun</mark3><br>
Shall on its stainless glory <mark3>set,</mark3><br>
Will linger, though enjoyed, like joy in memory <mark3>yet.</mark3><br>
