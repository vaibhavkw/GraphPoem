Title : Hymn to Proserpine (After the Proclamation in Rome of the Christian Faith) <br>
Author : Algernon Charles Swinburne <br><br>

Vicisti, Galilaee.<br>
I have lived long enough, having seen one thing, that love hath an <mark3>end;</mark3><br>
Goddess and maiden and queen, be near me now and <mark3>befriend.</mark3><br>
Thou art more than the day or the morrow, the seasons that laugh or that <mark3>weep;</mark3><br>
For these give joy and sorrow; but thou, Proserpina, <mark3>sleep.</mark3><br>
Sweet is the treading of wine, and sweet the feet of the <mark3>dove;</mark3><br>
But a goodlier gift is thine than foam of the grapes or <mark3>love.</mark3><br>
Yea, is not even Apollo, with hair and harpstring of <mark4>gold,</mark4><br>
A bitter God to follow, a beautiful God to <mark3>behold?</mark3><br>
I am sick of singing; the bays burn deep and chafe: I am <mark3>fain</mark3><br>
To rest a little from praise and grievous pleasure and <mark3>pain.</mark3><br>
For the Gods we know not of, who give us our daily <mark3>breath,</mark3><br>
We know they are cruel as love or life, and lovely as <mark3>death.</mark3><br>
O Gods dethroned and deceased, cast forth, wiped out in a <mark3>day!</mark3><br>
From your wrath is the world released, redeemed from your chains, men <mark3>say.</mark3><br>
New Gods are crowned in the city; their flowers have broken your <mark3>rods;</mark3><br>
They are merciful, clothed with pity, the young compassionate <mark3>Gods.</mark3><br>
But for me their new device is barren, the days are <mark4>bare;</mark4><br>
Things long past over suffice, and men forgotten that were. <br>
Time and the Gods are at strife; ye dwell in the midst <mark3>thereof,</mark3><br>
Draining a little life from the barren breasts of <mark1>love.</mark1><br>
I say to you, cease, take rest; yea, I say to you all, be at <mark3>peace,</mark3><br>
Till the bitter milk of her breast and the barren bosom shall <mark3>cease.</mark3><br>
Wilt thou yet take all, Galilean? but these thou shalt not <mark3>take,</mark3><br>
The laurel, the palms and the paean, the breasts of the nymphs in the <mark3>brake;</mark3><br>
Breasts more soft than a dove's, that tremble with tenderer <mark1>breath;</mark1><br>
And all the wings of the Loves, and all the joy before <mark1>death;</mark1><br>
All the feet of the hours that sound as a single <mark4>lyre,</mark4><br>
Dropped and deep in the flowers, with strings that flicker like <mark3>fire.</mark3><br>
More than these wilt thou give, things fairer than all these <mark4>things?</mark4><br>
Nay, for a little we live, and life hath mutable <mark3>wings.</mark3><br>
A little while and we die; shall life not thrive as it <mark3>may?</mark3><br>
For no man under the sky lives twice, outliving his <mark1>day.</mark1><br>
And grief is a grievous thing, and a man hath enough of his <mark4>tears:</mark4><br>
Why should he labour, and bring fresh grief to blacken his <mark3>years?</mark3><br>
Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world has grown grey from thy <mark1>breath;</mark1><br>
We have drunken of things Lethean, and fed on the fullness of <mark1>death.</mark1><br>
Laurel is green for a season, and love is sweet for a <mark1>day;</mark1><br>
But love grows bitter with treason, and laurel outlives not <mark1>May.</mark1><br>
Sleep, shall we sleep after all? for the world is not sweet in the <mark1>end;</mark1><br>
For the old faiths loosen and fall, the new years ruin and rend. <br>
Fate is a sea without shore, and the soul is a rock that <mark4>abides;</mark4><br>
But her ears are vexed with the roar and her face with the foam of the <mark3>tides.</mark3><br>
O lips that the live blood faints in, the leavings of racks and <mark1>rods!</mark1><br>
O ghastly glories of saints, dead limbs of gibbeted <mark1>Gods!</mark1><br>
Though all men abase them before you in spirit, and all knees <mark3>bend,</mark3><br>
I kneel not neither adore you, but standing, look to the <mark1>end.</mark1><br>
All delicate days and <mark4>pleasant</mark4>, all spirits and sorrows are <mark4>cast</mark4><br>
Far out with the foam of the present that sweeps to the surf of the <mark3>past:</mark3><br>
Where beyond the extreme sea-wall, and between the remote <mark4>sea-gates,</mark4><br>
Waste water washes, and tall ships founder, and deep death <mark3>waits:</mark3><br>
Where, mighty with deepening <mark4>sides</mark4>, clad about with the seas as with <mark1>wings,</mark1><br>
And impelled of invisible <mark4>tides</mark4>, and fulfilled of unspeakable <mark1>things,</mark1><br>
White-eyed and poisonous-finned, shark-toothed and <mark4>serpentine-curled,</mark4><br>
Rolls, under the whitening wind of the future, the wave of the <mark3>world.</mark3><br>
The depths stand naked in sunder behind it, the storms flee <mark3>away;</mark3><br>
In the hollow before it the thunder is taken and snared as a <mark3>prey;</mark3><br>
In its sides is the north-wind bound; and its salt is of all men's <mark1>tears;</mark1><br>
With light of ruin, and sound of <mark4>changes</mark4>, and pulse of <mark1>years:</mark1><br>
With travail of day after day, and with trouble of hour upon <mark4>hour;</mark4><br>
And bitter as blood is the spray; and the crests are as fangs that <mark3>devour:</mark3><br>
And its vapour and storm of its steam as the sighing of spirits to <mark3>be;</mark3><br>
And its noise as the noise in a dream; and its depth as the roots of the <mark3>sea:</mark3><br>
And the height of its heads as the height of the utmost stars of the <mark4>air:</mark4><br>
And the ends of the earth at the might thereof tremble, and time is made <mark1>bare.</mark1><br>
Will ye bridle the deep sea with <mark4>reins</mark4>, will ye chasten the high sea with <mark1>rods?</mark1><br>
Will ye take her to chain her with <mark4>chains</mark4>, who is older than all ye <mark1>Gods?</mark1><br>
All ye as a wind shall go by, as a fire shall ye pass and be <mark1>past;</mark1><br>
Ye are Gods, and behold, ye shall die, and the waves be upon you at <mark3>last.</mark3><br>
In the darkness of time, in the deeps of the <mark4>years</mark4>, in the changes of <mark1>things,</mark1><br>
Ye shall sleep as a slain man sleeps, and the world shall forget you for <mark3>kings.</mark3><br>
Though the feet of thine high priests tread where thy lords and our forefathers <mark4>trod,</mark4><br>
Though these that were Gods are <mark4>dead</mark4>, and thou being dead art a <mark3>God,</mark3><br>
Though before thee the throned Cytherean be fallen, and hidden her <mark4>head,</mark4><br>
Yet thy kingdom shall pass, Galilean, thy dead shall go down to thee <mark3>dead.</mark3><br>
Of the maiden thy mother men sing as a goddess with grace clad <mark4>around;</mark4><br>
Thou art throned where another was king; where another was queen she is <mark3>crowned.</mark3><br>
Yea, once we had sight of another: but now she is queen, say <mark4>these.</mark4><br>
Not as thine, not as thine was our mother, a blossom of flowering <mark3>seas,</mark3><br>
Clothed round with the world's desire as with raiment, and fair as the <mark3>foam,</mark3><br>
And fleeter than kindled fire, and a goddess, and mother of <mark3>Rome.</mark3><br>
For thine came pale and a maiden, and sister to sorrow; but <mark4>ours,</mark4><br>
Her deep hair heavily laden with odour and colour of <mark3>flowers,</mark3><br>
White rose of the rose-white water, a silver splendour, a <mark4>flame,</mark4><br>
Bent down unto us that besought her, and earth grew sweet with her <mark3>name.</mark3><br>
For thine came weeping, a slave among slaves, and rejected; but <mark3>she</mark3><br>
Came flushed from the full-flushed wave, and imperial, her foot on the <mark1>sea.</mark1><br>
And the wonderful waters knew her, the winds and the viewless <mark4>ways,</mark4><br>
And the roses grew rosier, and bluer the sea-blue stream of the <mark3>bays.</mark3><br>
Ye are fallen, our lords, by what token? we wise that ye should not <mark3>fall.</mark3><br>
Ye were all so fair that are broken; and one more fair than ye <mark3>all.</mark3><br>
But I turn to her still, having seen she shall surely abide in the <mark1>end;</mark1><br>
Goddess and maiden and queen, be near me now and <mark1>befriend.</mark1><br>
O daughter of earth, of my mother, her crown and blossom of <mark4>birth,</mark4><br>
I am also, I also, thy brother; I go as I came unto <mark3>earth.</mark3><br>
In the night where thine eyes are as moons are in heaven, the night where thou <mark4>art,</mark4><br>
Where the silence is more than all tunes, where sleep overflows from the <mark3>heart,</mark3><br>
Where the poppies are sweet as the rose in our world, and the red rose is <mark4>white,</mark4><br>
And the wind falls faint as it blows with the fume of the flowers of the <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
And the murmur of spirits that sleep in the shadow of Gods from <mark4>afar</mark4><br>
Grows dim in thine ears and deep as the deep dim soul of a <mark3>star,</mark3><br>
In the sweet low light of thy face, under heavens untrod by the <mark4>sun,</mark4><br>
Let my soul with their souls find place, and forget what is done and <mark3>undone.</mark3><br>
Thou art more than the Gods who number the days of our temporal <mark1>breath;</mark1><br>
Let these give labour and slumber; but thou, Proserpina, <mark1>death.</mark1><br>
Therefore now at thy feet I abide for a season in silence. I <mark3>know</mark3><br>
I shall die as my fathers died, and sleep as they sleep; even <mark3>so.</mark3><br>
For the glass of the years is brittle wherein we gaze for a <mark4>span;</mark4><br>
A little soul for a little bears up this corpse which is <mark3>man.</mark3><br>
So long I endure, no longer; and laugh not again, neither <mark1>weep.</mark1><br>
For there is no God found stronger than death; and death is a <mark1>sleep.</mark1><br>
