Title : Underwear <br>
Author : Lawrence Ferlinghetti <br><br>

I didn't get much sleep last <mark4>night</mark4><br>
thinking about <mark1>underwear</mark1><br>
Have you ever stopped to <mark4>consider</mark4><br>
underwear in the <mark4>abstract</mark4><br>
When you really dig into <mark4>it</mark4><br>
some shocking problems are <mark4>raised</mark4><br>
Underwear is <mark4>something</mark4><br>
we all have to deal <mark4>with</mark4><br>
Everyone <mark4>wears</mark4><br>
some kind of <mark1>underwear</mark1><br>
The Pope wears underwear I <mark4>hope</mark4><br>
The Governor of Louisiana   <br>
wears <mark1>underwear</mark1><br>
I saw him on <mark4>TV</mark4><br>
He must have had tight <mark1>underwear</mark1><br>
He squirmed a <mark4>lot</mark4><br>
Underwear can really get you in a <mark4>bind</mark4><br>
You have seen the underwear <mark4>ads</mark4><br>
for men and <mark4>women</mark4><br>
so alike but so <mark4>different</mark4><br>
Women's underwear holds things <mark4>up</mark4><br>
Men's underwear holds things <mark4>down</mark4><br>
Underwear is one <mark4>thing</mark4><br>
men and women have in <mark4>common</mark4><br>
Underwear is all we have between <mark4>us</mark4><br>
You have seen the three-color <mark4>pictures</mark4><br>
with crotches <mark4>encircled</mark4><br>
to show the areas of extra <mark4>strength</mark4><br>
and three-way <mark5>stretch</mark5><br>
promising full freedom of <mark4>action</mark4><br>
Don't be <mark4>deceived</mark4><br>
It's all based on the two-party <mark4>system</mark4><br>
which doesn't allow much freedom of <mark4>choice</mark4><br>
the way things are set <mark1>up</mark1><br>
America in its <mark1>Underwear</mark1><br>
struggles thru the <mark1>night</mark1><br>
Underwear controls everything in the <mark4>end</mark4><br>
Take foundation garments for <mark4>instance</mark4><br>
They are really fascist <mark4>forms</mark4><br>
of underground <mark4>government</mark4><br>
making people believe <br>
something but the <mark4>truth</mark4><br>
telling you what you can or can't do   <br>
Did you ever try to get around a <mark1>girdle</mark1><br>
Perhaps Non-Violent <mark1>Action</mark1><br>
is the only <mark4>answer</mark4><br>
Did Gandhi wear a <mark1>girdle?</mark1><br>
Did Lady Macbeth wear a <mark1>girdle?</mark1><br>
Was that why Macbeth murdered <mark4>sleep?</mark4><br>
And that spot she was always <mark4>rubbing--</mark4><br>
Was it really in her <mark1>underwear?</mark1><br>
Modern anglosaxon <mark4>ladies</mark4><br>
must have huge guilt <mark4>complexes</mark4><br>
always washing and washing and <mark4>washing</mark4><br>
Out damned <mark4>spot</mark4><br>
Underwear with spots very <mark4>suspicious</mark4><br>
Underwear with bulges very <mark4>shocking</mark4><br>
Underwear on clothesline a great flag of <mark4>freedom</mark4><br>
Someone has escaped his <mark1>Underwear</mark1><br>
May be naked <mark3>somewhere</mark3><br>
<br>
But don't <mark4>worry</mark4><br>
Everybody's still hung up in <mark1>it</mark1><br>
There won't be no real <mark4>revolution</mark4><br>
And poetry still the underwear of the <mark4>soul</mark4><br>
And underwear still <mark4>covering</mark4><br>
a multitude of <mark4>faults</mark4><br>
in the geological <mark4>sense--</mark4><br>
strange sedimentary stones, inscrutable <mark4>cracks!</mark4><br>
If I were you I'd keep <mark4>aside</mark4><br>
an oversize pair of winter <mark1>underwear</mark1><br>
Do not go naked into that good <mark1>night</mark1><br>
And in the <mark4>meantime</mark4><br>
keep calm and warm and dry <br>
No use stirring ourselves up <mark4>prematurely</mark4><br>
'over <mark4>Nothing'</mark4><br>
Move forward with <mark4>dignity</mark4><br>
hand in <mark4>vest</mark4><br>
Don't get <mark4>emotional</mark4><br>
And death shall have no <mark4>dominion</mark4><br>
There's plenty of time my <mark4>darling</mark4><br>
Are we not still young and <mark4>easy</mark4><br>
Don't <mark4>shout</mark4><br>
