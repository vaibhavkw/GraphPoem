Title : The Lawyers' Ways <br>
Author : Paul Laurence Dunbar <br><br>

I've been list'nin' to them <mark4>lawyers</mark4><br>
In the court house up the <mark3>street,</mark3><br>
An' I've come to the <mark4>conclusion</mark4><br>
That I'm most completely <mark3>beat.</mark3><br>
Fust one feller riz to argy,<br>
An' he boldly waded <mark4>in</mark4><br>
As he dressed the tremblin' <mark4>pris'ner</mark4><br>
In a coat o' deep-dyed <mark3>sin.</mark3><br>
<br>
Why, he painted him all <mark4>over</mark4><br>
In a hue o' blackest <mark3>crime,</mark3><br>
An' he smeared his <mark4>reputation</mark4><br>
With the thickest kind o' <mark3>grime,</mark3><br>
Tell I found myself a-wond'rin',<br>
In a misty way and <mark4>dim,</mark4><br>
How the Lord had come to <mark4>fashion</mark4><br>
Sich an awful man as <mark3>him.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then the other lawyer <mark4>started,</mark4><br>
An' with brimmin', tearful <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
Said his client was a <mark4>martyr</mark4><br>
That was brought to <mark4>sacrifice.</mark4><br>
An' he give to that same <mark1>pris'ner</mark1><br>
Every blessed human <mark4>grace,</mark4><br>
Tell I saw the light o' virtue<br>
Fairly shinin' from his <mark3>face.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then I own 'at I was <mark4>puzzled</mark4><br>
How sich things could rightly <mark3>be;</mark3><br>
An' this aggervatin' <mark4>question</mark4><br>
Seems to keep a-puzzlin' <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
So, will some one please inform <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
An' this mystery <mark4>unroll?</mark4><br>
How an angel an' a <mark4>devil</mark4><br>
Can persess the self-same <mark4>soul?</mark4><br>
