Title : Hero and Leander <br>
Author : Christopher Marlowe <br><br>

The First Sestiad  (excerpt)<br>
On Hellespont, guilty of true love's <mark4>blood,</mark4><br>
In view and opposite two cities <mark4>stood,</mark4><br>
Sea-borderers, disjoin'd by Neptune's <mark3>might;</mark3><br>
The one Abydos, the other Sestos <mark3>hight.</mark3><br>
At Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the <mark3>fair,</mark3><br>
Whom young Apollo courted for her <mark3>hair,</mark3><br>
And offer'd as a dower his burning <mark4>throne,</mark4><br>
Where she could sit for men to gaze <mark4>upon.</mark4><br>
The outside of her garments were of <mark4>lawn,</mark4><br>
The lining purple silk, with gilt stars <mark3>drawn;</mark3><br>
Her wide sleeves green, and border'd with a <mark3>grove,</mark3><br>
Where Venus in her naked glory <mark3>strove</mark3><br>
To please the careless and disdainful <mark3>eyes</mark3><br>
Of proud Adonis, that before her <mark3>lies;</mark3><br>
Her kirtle blue, whereon was many a <mark4>stain,</mark4><br>
Made with the blood of wretched lovers <mark3>slain.</mark3><br>
Upon her head she ware a myrtle <mark3>wreath,</mark3><br>
From whence her veil reach'd to the ground <mark3>beneath;</mark3><br>
Her veil was artificial flowers and <mark4>leaves,</mark4><br>
Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives; <br>
Many would praise the sweet smell as she <mark4>past,</mark4><br>
When 'twas the odour which her breath forth <mark3>cast;</mark3><br>
And there for honey bees have sought in <mark3>vain,</mark3><br>
And beat from thence, have lighted there <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
About her neck hung chains of <mark4>pebble-stone,</mark4><br>
Which lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds <mark3>shone.</mark3><br>
She ware no gloves; for neither sun nor <mark4>wind</mark4><br>
Would burn or parch her hands, but, to her <mark3>mind,</mark3><br>
Or warm or cool them, for they took <mark4>delight</mark4><br>
To play upon those hands, they were so <mark3>white.</mark3><br>
Buskins of shells, all silver'd, used <mark3>she,</mark3><br>
And branch'd with blushing coral to the <mark3>knee;</mark3><br>
Where sparrows perch'd, of hollow pearl and <mark4>gold,</mark4><br>
Such as the world would wonder to <mark3>behold:</mark3><br>
Those with sweet water oft her handmaid <mark4>fills,</mark4><br>
Which as she went, would chirrup through the <mark3>bills.</mark3><br>
Some say, for her the fairest Cupid <mark4>pin'd,</mark4><br>
And looking in her face, was strooken <mark4>blind.</mark4><br>
But this is true; so like was one the <mark3>other,</mark3><br>
As he imagin'd Hero was his <mark3>mother;</mark3><br>
And oftentimes into her bosom <mark3>flew,</mark3><br>
About her naked neck his bare arms <mark3>threw,</mark3><br>
And laid his childish head upon her <mark4>breast,</mark4><br>
And with still panting rock'd there took his <mark3>rest.</mark3><br>
So lovely-fair was Hero, Venus' <mark4>nun,</mark4><br>
As Nature wept, thinking she was <mark3>undone,</mark3><br>
Because she took more from her than she <mark4>left,</mark4><br>
And of such wondrous beauty her <mark3>bereft:</mark3><br>
Therefore, in sign her treasure suffer'd <mark3>wrack,</mark3><br>
Since Hero's time hath half the world been <mark3>black.</mark3><br>
<br>
Amorous Leander, beautiful and <mark3>young</mark3><br>
(Whose tragedy divine Musaeus <mark3>sung),</mark3><br>
Dwelt at Abydos; since him dwelt there <mark3>none</mark3><br>
For whom succeeding times make greater <mark4>moan.</mark4><br>
His dangling tresses, that were never <mark4>shorn,</mark4><br>
Had they been cut, and unto Colchos <mark3>borne,</mark3><br>
Would have allur'd the vent'rous youth of <mark3>Greece</mark3><br>
To hazard more than for the golden <mark3>fleece.</mark3><br>
Fair Cynthia wish'd his arms might be her <mark4>sphere;</mark4><br>
Grief makes her pale, because she moves not <mark4>there.</mark4><br>
His body was as straight as Circe's <mark4>wand;</mark4><br>
Jove might have sipt out nectar from his <mark4>hand.</mark4><br>
Even as delicious meat is to the <mark4>taste,</mark4><br>
So was his neck in touching, and surpast <br>
The white of Pelops' shoulder: I could tell <mark3>ye,</mark3><br>
How smooth his breast was, and how white his <mark4>belly;</mark4><br>
And whose immortal fingers did <mark4>imprint</mark4><br>
That heavenly path with many a curious <mark3>dint</mark3><br>
That runs along his back; but my rude <mark4>pen</mark4><br>
Can hardly blazon forth the loves of <mark3>men,</mark3><br>
Much less of powerful gods: let it <mark4>suffice</mark4><br>
That my slack Muse sings of Leander's <mark1>eyes;</mark1><br>
Those orient cheeks and lips, exceeding <mark4>his</mark4><br>
That leapt into the water for a <mark4>kiss</mark4><br>
Of his own shadow, and, despising <mark4>many,</mark4><br>
Died ere he could enjoy the love of <mark3>any.</mark3><br>
Had wild Hippolytus Leander <mark4>seen,</mark4><br>
Enamour'd of his beauty had he <mark4>been.</mark4><br>
His presence made the rudest peasant <mark4>melt,</mark4><br>
That in the vast uplandish country <mark3>dwelt;</mark3><br>
The barbarous Thracian soldier, mov'd with nought, <br>
Was mov'd with him, and for his favour <mark4>sought.</mark4><br>
Some swore he was a maid in man's <mark4>attire,</mark4><br>
For in his looks were all that men <mark3>desire,--</mark3><br>
A pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking <mark5>eye,</mark5><br>
A brow for love to banquet <mark4>royally;</mark4><br>
And such as knew he was a man, would <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
"Leander, thou art made for amorous <mark3>play;</mark3><br>
Why art thou not in love, and lov'd of <mark3>all?</mark3><br>
Though thou be fair, yet be not thine own <mark3>thrall."</mark3><br>
<br>
The men of wealthy Sestos every <mark4>year,</mark4><br>
For his sake whom their goddess held so <mark3>dear,</mark3><br>
Rose-cheek'd Adonis, kept a solemn <mark4>feast.</mark4><br>
Thither resorted many a wandering <mark4>guest</mark4><br>
To meet their loves; such as had none at <mark1>all</mark1><br>
Came lovers home from this great <mark4>festival;</mark4><br>
For every street, like to a firmament, <br>
Glister'd with breathing stars, who, where they <mark4>went,</mark4><br>
Frighted the melancholy earth, which <mark4>deem'd</mark4><br>
Eternal heaven to burn, for so it <mark3>seem'd</mark3><br>
As if another Pha{"e}ton had <mark4>got</mark4><br>
The guidance of the sun's rich <mark4>chariot.</mark4><br>
But far above the loveliest, Hero <mark4>shin'd,</mark4><br>
And stole away th' enchanted gazer's <mark1>mind;</mark1><br>
For like sea-nymphs' inveigling <mark4>harmony,</mark4><br>
So was her beauty to the <mark3>standers-by;</mark3><br>
Nor that night-wandering, pale, and watery <mark4>star</mark4><br>
(When yawning dragons draw her thirling <mark3>car</mark3><br>
From Latmus' mount up to the gloomy <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
Where, crown'd with blazing light and <mark4>majesty,</mark4><br>
She proudly sits) more over-rules the <mark4>flood</mark4><br>
Than she the hearts of those that near her <mark1>stood.</mark1><br>
Even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the <mark4>chase,</mark4><br>
Wretched Ixion's shaggy-footed <mark3>race,</mark3><br>
Incens'd with savage heat, gallop amain <br>
From steep pine-bearing mountains to the <mark4>plain,</mark4><br>
So ran the people forth to gaze upon <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
And all that view'd her were enamour'd on <mark1>her.</mark1><br>
And as in fury of a dreadful <mark4>fight,</mark4><br>
Their fellows being slain or put to <mark3>flight,</mark3><br>
Poor soldiers stand with fear of death <mark5>dead-strooken,</mark5><br>
So at her presence all surpris'd and tooken, <br>
Await the sentence of her scornful <mark1>eyes;</mark1><br>
He whom she favours <mark4>lives</mark4>, the other <mark3>dies.</mark3><br>
There might you see one sigh, another <mark3>rage,</mark3><br>
And some, their violent passions to <mark3>assuage,</mark3><br>
Compile sharp satires; but, alas, too <mark4>late,</mark4><br>
For faithful love will never turn to <mark3>hate.</mark3><br>
And many, seeing great princes were <mark4>denied,</mark4><br>
Pin'd as they went, and thinking on her, <mark3>died.</mark3><br>
On this feast-day--O cursed day and <mark4>hour!--</mark4><br>
Went Hero thorough Sestos, from her <mark3>tower</mark3><br>
To Venus' temple, where <mark4>unhappily,</mark4><br>
As after chanc'd, they did each other <mark3>spy.</mark3><br>
So fair a church as this had Venus <mark1>none:</mark1><br>
The walls were of discolour'd <mark4>jasper-stone,</mark4><br>
Wherein was Proteus <mark4>carved</mark4>, and <mark4>over-head</mark4><br>
A lively vine of green sea-agate <mark3>spread,</mark3><br>
Where by one hand light-headed Bacchus <mark3>hung,</mark3><br>
And with the other wine from grapes <mark3>out-wrung.</mark3><br>
Of crystal shining fair the pavement <mark4>was;</mark4><br>
The town of Sestos call'd it Venus' <mark4>glass:</mark4><br>
There might you see the gods in sundry <mark4>shapes,</mark4><br>
Committing heady riots, incest, <mark3>rapes:</mark3><br>
For know, that underneath this radiant <mark3>flower</mark3><br>
Was Danae's statue in a brazen <mark1>tower,</mark1><br>
Jove slyly stealing from his sister's <mark3>bed,</mark3><br>
To dally with Idalian Ganimed, <br>
And for his love Europa bellowing <mark4>loud,</mark4><br>
And tumbling with the rainbow in a <mark3>cloud;</mark3><br>
Blood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron <mark4>net,</mark4><br>
Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops <mark3>set;</mark3><br>
Love kindling fire, to burn such towns as <mark3>Troy,</mark3><br>
Sylvanus weeping for the lovely <mark3>boy</mark3><br>
That now is turn'd into a cypress <mark3>tree,</mark3><br>
Under whose shade the wood-gods love to <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
And in the midst a silver altar <mark1>stood:</mark1><br>
There Hero, sacrificing turtles' <mark1>blood,</mark1><br>
Vail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids <mark4>close;</mark4><br>
And modestly they opened as she <mark3>rose.</mark3><br>
Thence flew Love's arrow with the golden <mark4>head;</mark4><br>
And thus Leander was enamoured. <br>
Stone-still he <mark4>stood</mark4>, and evermore he <mark4>gazed,</mark4><br>
Till with the fire that from his count'nance <mark3>blazed</mark3><br>
Relenting Hero's gentle heart was <mark5>strook:</mark5><br>
Such force and virtue hath an amorous <mark4>look.</mark4><br>
<br>
It lies not in our power to love or <mark1>hate,</mark1><br>
For will in us is over-rul'd by <mark3>fate.</mark3><br>
When two are stript, long ere the course <mark4>begin,</mark4><br>
We wish that one should lose, the other <mark3>win;</mark3><br>
And one especially do we <mark4>affect</mark4><br>
Of two gold ingots, like in each <mark3>respect:</mark3><br>
The reason no man knows, let it <mark1>suffice,</mark1><br>
What we behold is censur'd by our <mark1>eyes.</mark1><br>
Where both <mark4>deliberate</mark4>, the love is <mark4>slight:</mark4><br>
Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first <mark3>sight?</mark3><br>
