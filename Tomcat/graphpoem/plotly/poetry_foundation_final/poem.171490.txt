Title : Sunday: New Guinea <br>
Author : Karl Shapiro <br><br>

The bugle sounds the measured call to <mark3>prayers,</mark3><br>
The band starts bravely with a clarion <mark2>hymn,</mark2><br>
From every side, singly, in groups, in <mark3>pairs,</mark3><br>
Each to his kind of service comes to worship <mark2>Him.</mark2><br>
<br>
Our faces washed, our hearts in the right <mark4>place,</mark4><br>
We kneel or stand or listen from our <mark4>tents;</mark4><br>
Half-naked natives with their kind of <mark4>grace</mark4><br>
Move down the road with balanced staffs like mendicants.<br>
<br>
And over the hill the guns bang like a <mark3>door</mark3><br>
And planes repeat their mission in the <mark4>heights.</mark4><br>
The jungle outmaneuvers creeping <mark3>war</mark3><br>
And crawls within the circle of our sacred <mark3>rites.</mark3><br>
<br>
I long for our disheveled Sundays <mark4>home,</mark4><br>
Breakfast, the comics, news of latest <mark4>crimes,</mark4><br>
    Talk without reference, and palindromes,<br>
Sleep and the Philharmonic and the ponderous <mark3>Times.</mark3><br>
<br>
I long for lounging in the <mark4>afternoons</mark4><br>
Of clean intelligent warmth, my brother's <mark3>mind,</mark3><br>
Books and thin plates and flowers and shining <mark3>spoons,</mark3><br>
And your love's presence, snowy, beautiful, and <mark3>kind.</mark3><br>
