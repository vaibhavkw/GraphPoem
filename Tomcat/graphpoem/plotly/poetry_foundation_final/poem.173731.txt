Title : To the Memory of My Beloved the Author, Mr. William Shakespeare <br>
Author : Ben Jonson <br><br>

To draw no envy, Shakespeare, on thy <mark3>name,</mark3><br>
Am I thus ample to thy book and <mark3>fame;</mark3><br>
While I confess thy writings to be <mark3>such</mark3><br>
As neither man nor muse can praise too <mark3>much;</mark3><br>
'Tis true, and all men's suffrage. But these <mark3>ways</mark3><br>
Were not the paths I meant unto thy <mark3>praise;</mark3><br>
For seeliest ignorance on these may <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
Which, when it sounds at <mark4>best</mark4>, but echoes <mark3>right;</mark3><br>
Or blind affection, which doth ne'er <mark3>advance</mark3><br>
The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by <mark3>chance;</mark3><br>
Or crafty malice might pretend this <mark1>praise,</mark1><br>
And think to ruin, where it seem'd to <mark3>raise.</mark3><br>
These <mark4>are</mark4>, as some infamous bawd or <mark4>whore</mark4><br>
Should praise a matron; what could hurt her <mark3>more?</mark3><br>
But thou art proof against them, and <mark3>indeed,</mark3><br>
Above th' ill fortune of them, or the <mark3>need.</mark3><br>
I therefore will begin. Soul of the <mark3>age!</mark3><br>
The applause, delight, the wonder of our <mark3>stage!</mark3><br>
My Shakespeare, rise! I will not lodge thee <mark3>by</mark3><br>
Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont <mark3>lie</mark3><br>
A little further, to make thee a <mark4>room:</mark4><br>
Thou art a monument without a <mark3>tomb,</mark3><br>
And art alive still while thy book doth <mark3>live</mark3><br>
And we have wits to read and praise to <mark3>give.</mark3><br>
That I not mix thee so, my brain <mark4>excuses,</mark4><br>
I mean with great, but disproportion'd <mark3>Muses,</mark3><br>
For if I thought my judgment were of <mark4>years,</mark4><br>
I should commit thee surely with thy <mark3>peers,</mark3><br>
And tell how far thou didst our Lyly <mark4>outshine,</mark4><br>
Or sporting Kyd, or Marlowe's mighty <mark4>line.</mark4><br>
And though thou hadst small Latin and less <mark3>Greek,</mark3><br>
From thence to honour thee, I would not <mark3>seek</mark3><br>
For names; but call forth thund'ring Aeschylus, <br>
Euripides and Sophocles to <mark4>us;</mark4><br>
Pacuvius, Accius, him of Cordova <mark4>dead,</mark4><br>
To life again, to hear thy buskin <mark3>tread,</mark3><br>
And shake a stage; or, when thy socks were <mark4>on,</mark4><br>
Leave thee alone for the <mark4>comparison</mark4><br>
Of all that insolent Greece or haughty <mark4>Rome</mark4><br>
Sent forth, or since did from their ashes <mark4>come.</mark4><br>
Tri'umph, my Britain, thou hast one to <mark3>show</mark3><br>
To whom all scenes of Europe homage <mark3>owe.</mark3><br>
He was not of an age but for all <mark4>time!</mark4><br>
And all the Muses still were in their <mark3>prime,</mark3><br>
When, like Apollo, he came forth to <mark4>warm</mark4><br>
Our ears, or like a Mercury to <mark4>charm!</mark4><br>
Nature herself was proud of his <mark4>designs</mark4><br>
And joy'd to wear the dressing of his <mark3>lines,</mark3><br>
Which were so richly spun, and woven so <mark4>fit,</mark4><br>
As, since, she will vouchsafe no other <mark3>wit.</mark3><br>
The merry Greek, tart <mark4>Aristophanes,</mark4><br>
Neat Terence, witty Plautus, now not <mark4>please,</mark4><br>
But antiquated and deserted <mark1>lie,</mark1><br>
As they were not of Nature's <mark5>family.</mark5><br>
Yet must I not give Nature all: thy <mark4>art,</mark4><br>
My gentle Shakespeare, must enjoy a <mark3>part.</mark3><br>
For though the poet's matter nature <mark4>be,</mark4><br>
His art doth give the fashion; and, that <mark3>he</mark3><br>
Who casts to write a living line, must <mark4>sweat,</mark4><br>
(Such as thine are) and strike the second <mark4>heat</mark4><br>
Upon the Muses' anvil; turn the <mark4>same</mark4><br>
(And himself with it) that he thinks to <mark3>frame,</mark3><br>
Or, for the laurel, he may gain a <mark4>scorn;</mark4><br>
For a good poet's made, as well as <mark3>born;</mark3><br>
And such wert thou. Look how the father's <mark4>face</mark4><br>
Lives in his issue, even so the <mark3>race</mark3><br>
Of Shakespeare's mind and manners brightly <mark4>shines</mark4><br>
In his well-turned, and true-filed <mark1>lines;</mark1><br>
In each of which he seems to shake a <mark4>lance,</mark4><br>
As brandish'd at the eyes of <mark4>ignorance.</mark4><br>
Sweet Swan of Avon! what a sight it were <br>
To see thee in our waters yet <mark4>appear,</mark4><br>
And make those flights upon the banks of <mark4>Thames,</mark4><br>
That so did take Eliza and our <mark4>James!</mark4><br>
But stay, I see thee in the <mark4>hemisphere</mark4><br>
Advanc'd, and made a constellation <mark4>there!</mark4><br>
Shine forth, thou star of poets, and with <mark3>rage</mark3><br>
Or influence, chide or cheer the drooping <mark1>stage;</mark1><br>
Which, since thy flight from hence, hath mourn'd like <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
And despairs day, but for thy volume's <mark1>light.</mark1><br>
