Title : Shakespeare <br>
Author : Henry Wadsworth Longfellow <br><br>

A vision as of crowded city <mark3>streets,</mark3><br>
With human life in endless <mark3>overflow;</mark3><br>
Thunder of thoroughfares; trumpets that <mark3>blow</mark3><br>
To battle; clamor, in obscure <mark3>retreats,</mark3><br>
Of sailors landed from their anchored <mark3>fleets;</mark3><br>
Tolling of bells in turrets, and <mark3>below</mark3><br>
Voices of children, and bright flowers that <mark3>throw</mark3><br>
O'er garden-walls their intermingled <mark3>sweets!</mark3><br>
This vision comes to me when I <mark3>unfold</mark3><br>
      The volume of the Poet paramount, <br>
Whom all the Muses loved, not one alone; <mark3>--</mark3><br>
Into his hands they put the lyre of <mark3>gold,</mark3><br>
      And, crowned with sacred laurel at their fount, <br>
Placed him as Musagetes on their <mark3>throne.</mark3><br>
