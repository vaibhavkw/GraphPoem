Title : What Is Impossible <br>
Author : A. F. Moritz <br><br>

About the age of twenty, when the first hairfall <br>
signals that nature is finished with the <mark4>organism</mark4><br>
and we just begin to conceive the use of <mark4>women</mark4><br>
(having been all this <mark4>time</mark4><br>
more enamored of the fountain than the <mark4>cistern),</mark4><br>
we retire to nursing <mark4>homes,</mark4><br>
whether they be kaleidoscopic <mark4>gardens</mark4><br>
aimed like a blunderbuss of hermeticism at our <mark4>neighbors,</mark4><br>
or a desperate dream safari through old Zambesi, <br>
where the suicidal waves of angry <mark4>natives</mark4><br>
give the illusion that we are advancing rapidly, <br>
or the crow's-nest of this windless office block <br>
where the cook is already boiling the last <mark4>sail.</mark4><br>
<br>
And sitting on the bench like a snowfall of beard <br>
expectorated by a cloudy <mark4>hat,</mark4><br>
we consider the byproducts of life, <br>
such as (to name only the least offensive to the <mark4>nose)</mark4><br>
the body itself when it has finally <mark4>reached</mark4><br>
that eminence from which all is <mark4>visible</mark4><br>
and from which it nonetheless feels the need to move <mark4>on</mark4><br>
to a homestead of its dreams like an abandoned chicken coop <br>
on the sandy streamside under the tulip poplars, <br>
and to words, which result from an <mark4>instinct</mark4><br>
for what is <mark4>impossible:</mark4><br>
to soften the blow for <mark4>others</mark4>, including <mark4>ourselves.</mark4><br>
