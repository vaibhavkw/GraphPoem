Title : Partial Resemblance <br>
Author : Denise Levertov <br><br>

A doll's hair concealing   <br>
an eggshell skull delicately   <br>
throbbing, within which <br>
maggots in voluptuous <mark4>unrest</mark4><br>
jostle and shrug. Oh, Eileen, my   <br>
big doll, your gold hair <mark1>was</mark1><br>
not more sunny than <mark4>this</mark4><br>
human fur, <mark4>but</mark4><br>
your head <mark1>was</mark1><br>
radiant in its <mark4>emptiness,</mark4><br>
a small clean room. <br>
<br>
Her warm and rosy mouth <br>
is telling lies--she <mark4>would</mark4><br>
believe them if she could believe:   <br>
her pretty <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
search out corruption. Oh, Eileen   <br>
how kindly your silence was, <mark4>and</mark4><br>
what virtue <br>
shone in the opening and shutting of your   <br>
ingenious <mark4>blindness.</mark4><br>
