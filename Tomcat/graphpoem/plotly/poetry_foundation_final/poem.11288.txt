Title : Remarks on Poetry and the Physical World<br>
Author : Mary Barnard<br><br>

After reading Ash <mark4>Wednesday</mark4><br>
she looked once at the baked <mark4>beans</mark4><br>
and fled. Luncheonless, poor <mark4>girl,</mark4><br>
she observed a kind of poetic Lent-- <br>
and I had thought I liked <mark4>poetry</mark4><br>
better than she <mark4>did.</mark4><br>
<br>
I do. But to me its most endearing <br>
quality is its unsuitableness; <br>
and, conversely, the chief wonder in heaven   <br>
(whither I also am sometimes <mark4>transported)</mark4><br>
is the kind of baggage I bring with me. <br>
<br>
Surely there is no more exquisite jointure   <br>
in the anatomy of life than that at which   <br>
poetry dovetails with the inevitable <mark4>meal</mark4><br>
and Mrs. B. sits murmuring of <mark4>avocados.</mark4><br>
