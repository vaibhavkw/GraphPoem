Title : A Dialogue between the Soul and the Body <br>
Author : Andrew Marvell <br><br>

<br>
O who shall, from this dungeon, <mark3>raise</mark3><br>
A soul enslav'd so many <mark3>ways?</mark3><br>
With bolts of <mark4>bones</mark4>, that fetter'd <mark4>stands</mark4><br>
In feet, and manacled in <mark3>hands;</mark3><br>
Here blinded with an eye, and <mark4>there</mark4><br>
Deaf with the drumming of an <mark4>ear;</mark4><br>
A soul hung up, as 'twere, in <mark4>chains</mark4><br>
Of nerves, and <mark4>arteries</mark4>, and <mark3>veins;</mark3><br>
Tortur'd, besides each other <mark3>part,</mark3><br>
In a vain head, and double <mark3>heart.</mark3><br>
<br>
O who shall me deliver <mark3>whole</mark3><br>
From bonds of this tyrannic <mark3>soul?</mark3><br>
Which, stretch'd upright, impales me <mark3>so</mark3><br>
That mine own precipice I <mark3>go;</mark3><br>
And warms and moves this needless <mark3>frame,</mark3><br>
(A fever could but do the <mark3>same)</mark3><br>
And, wanting where its spite to <mark3>try,</mark3><br>
Has made me live to let me <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
A body that could never <mark4>rest,</mark4><br>
Since this ill spirit it possest. <br>
What magic could me thus <mark3>confine</mark3><br>
<br>
Within another's grief to <mark3>pine?</mark3><br>
Where whatsoever it <mark4>complain,</mark4><br>
I feel, that cannot feel, the <mark3>pain;</mark3><br>
And all my care itself <mark4>employs;</mark4><br>
That to preserve which me <mark3>destroys;</mark3><br>
Constrain'd not only to <mark4>endure</mark4><br>
Diseases, but, what's worse, the <mark3>cure;</mark3><br>
And ready oft the port to <mark3>gain,</mark3><br>
Am shipwreck'd into health <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
But physic yet could never <mark3>reach</mark3><br>
The maladies thou me dost <mark3>teach;</mark3><br>
<br>
Whom first the cramp of hope does <mark4>tear,</mark4><br>
And then the palsy shakes of <mark3>fear;</mark3><br>
The pestilence of love does <mark4>heat,</mark4><br>
Or hatred's hidden ulcer <mark3>eat;</mark3><br>
Joy's cheerful madness does <mark3>perplex,</mark3><br>
Or sorrow's other madness <mark3>vex;</mark3><br>
Which knowledge forces me to <mark3>know,</mark3><br>
And memory will not <mark3>forego.</mark3><br>
What but a soul could have the <mark4>wit</mark4><br>
To build me up for sin so <mark3>fit?</mark3><br>
So architects do square and <mark3>hew</mark3><br>
Green trees that in the forest <mark3>grew.</mark3><br>
