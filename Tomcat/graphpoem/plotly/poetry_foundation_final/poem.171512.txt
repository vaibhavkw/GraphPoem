Title : April Inventory <br>
Author : W. D. Snodgrass <br><br>

The green catalpa tree has <mark3>turned</mark3><br>
All white; the cherry blooms once <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
In one whole year I haven't <mark3>learned</mark3><br>
A blessed thing they pay you <mark3>for.</mark3><br>
The blossoms snow down in my <mark4>hair;</mark4><br>
The trees and I will soon be <mark3>bare.</mark3><br>
<br>
The trees have more than I to <mark3>spare.</mark3><br>
The sleek, expensive girls I <mark3>teach,</mark3><br>
Younger and pinker every <mark4>year,</mark4><br>
Bloom gradually out of <mark3>reach.</mark3><br>
The pear tree lets its petals <mark4>drop</mark4><br>
Like dandruff on a <mark4>tabletop.</mark4><br>
<br>
The girls have grown so young by <mark3>now</mark3><br>
I have to nudge myself to <mark4>stare.</mark4><br>
This year they smile and mind me <mark3>how</mark3><br>
My teeth are falling with my <mark1>hair.</mark1><br>
In thirty years I may not <mark3>get</mark3><br>
Younger, shrewder, or out of <mark3>debt.</mark3><br>
<br>
The tenth time, just a year <mark3>ago,</mark3><br>
I made myself a little <mark4>list</mark4><br>
Of all the things I'd ought to <mark3>know,</mark3><br>
Then told my parents, <mark4>analyst,</mark4><br>
And everyone who's trusted <mark3>me</mark3><br>
I'd be substantial, <mark4>presently.</mark4><br>
<br>
I haven't read one book <mark4>about</mark4><br>
A book or memorized one <mark4>plot.</mark4><br>
Or found a mind I did not <mark4>doubt.</mark4><br>
I learned one <mark4>date</mark4>, And then <mark4>forgot.</mark4><br>
And one by one the solid <mark3>scholars</mark3><br>
Get the degrees, the <mark4>jobs</mark4>, the <mark3>dollars.</mark3><br>
<br>
And smile above their starchy <mark3>collars.</mark3><br>
I taught my classes Whitehead's <mark4>notions;</mark4><br>
One lovely girl, a song of <mark4>Mahler's.</mark4><br>
Lacking a source-book or <mark4>promotions,</mark4><br>
I showed one child the colors <mark3>of</mark3><br>
A luna moth and how to <mark3>love.</mark3><br>
<br>
I taught myself to name my <mark3>name,</mark3><br>
To bark back, loosen love and <mark3>crying;</mark3><br>
To ease my woman so she <mark3>came,</mark3><br>
To ease an old man who was <mark3>dying.</mark3><br>
I have not learned how often <mark3>I</mark3><br>
Can win, can love, but choose to <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
<br>
I have not learned there is a <mark3>lie</mark3><br>
Love shall be blonder, <mark4>slimmer</mark4>, <mark4>younger;</mark4><br>
That my equivocating <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
Loves only by my body's <mark3>hunger;</mark3><br>
That I have forces, true to <mark3>feel,</mark3><br>
Or that the lovely world is <mark3>real.</mark3><br>
<br>
While scholars speak <mark4>authority</mark4><br>
And wear their ulcers on their <mark4>sleeves,</mark4><br>
My eyes in spectacles shall <mark3>see</mark3><br>
These trees procure and spend their <mark3>leaves.</mark3><br>
There is a value <mark3>underneath</mark3><br>
The gold and silver in my <mark3>teeth.</mark3><br>
<br>
Though trees turn bare and girls turn <mark4>wives,</mark4><br>
We shall afford our costly <mark4>seasons;</mark4><br>
There is a gentleness <mark4>survives</mark4><br>
That will outspeak and has its <mark4>reasons.</mark4><br>
There is a loveliness <mark4>exists,</mark4><br>
Preserves <mark4>us</mark4>, not for <mark4>specialists.</mark4><br>
