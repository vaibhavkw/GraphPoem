Title : Darkness <br>
Author : Lord Byron (George Gordon) <br><br>

I had a <mark1>dream</mark1>, which was not all a <mark1>dream.</mark1><br>
The bright sun was <mark4>extinguish'd</mark4>, and the <mark4>stars</mark4><br>
Did wander darkling in the eternal <mark4>space,</mark4><br>
Rayless, and pathless, and the icy <mark4>earth</mark4><br>
Swung blind and blackening in the moonless <mark4>air;</mark4><br>
Morn came and went?and came, and brought no <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
And men forgot their passions in the <mark5>dread</mark5><br>
Of this their desolation; and all <mark4>hearts</mark4><br>
Were chill'd into a selfish prayer for <mark1>light:</mark1><br>
And they did live by watchfires?and the thrones,<br>
The palaces of crowned kings?the <mark4>huts,</mark4><br>
The habitations of all things which <mark4>dwell,</mark4><br>
Were burnt for beacons; cities were <mark5>consum'd,</mark5><br>
And men were gather'd round their blazing <mark4>homes</mark4><br>
To look once more into each other's <mark4>face;</mark4><br>
Happy were those who dwelt within the <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
Of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch:<br>
A fearful hope was all the world <mark4>contain'd;</mark4><br>
Forests were set on fire?but hour by <mark4>hour</mark4><br>
They fell and faded?and the crackling <mark4>trunks</mark4><br>
Extinguish'd with a crash?and all was black.<br>
The brows of men by the despairing <mark1>light</mark1><br>
Wore an unearthly aspect, as by <mark4>fits</mark4><br>
The flashes fell upon them; some lay <mark4>down</mark4><br>
And hid their eyes and <mark4>wept</mark4>, and some did <mark4>rest</mark4><br>
Their chins upon their clenched hands, and smil'd;<br>
And others hurried to and fro, and <mark3>fed</mark3><br>
Their funeral piles with fuel, and look'd <mark1>up</mark1><br>
With mad disquietude on the dull <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
The pall of a past world; and then <mark4>again</mark4><br>
With curses cast them down upon the <mark4>dust,</mark4><br>
And gnash'd their teeth and howl'd: the wild birds <mark4>shriek'd</mark4><br>
And, <mark4>terrified</mark4>, did flutter on the <mark4>ground,</mark4><br>
And flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes<br>
Came tame and tremulous; and vipers <mark4>crawl'd</mark4><br>
And twin'd themselves among the <mark4>multitude,</mark4><br>
Hissing, but stingless?they were slain for <mark4>food.</mark4><br>
And <mark3>War</mark3>, which for a moment was no <mark4>more,</mark4><br>
Did glut himself again: a meal was <mark4>bought</mark4><br>
With blood, and each sate sullenly <mark4>apart</mark4><br>
Gorging himself in gloom: no love was <mark4>left;</mark4><br>
All earth was but one thought?and that was <mark4>death</mark4><br>
Immediate and inglorious; and the pang<br>
Of famine fed upon all entrails?men<br>
Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh;<br>
The meagre by the meagre were <mark4>devour'd,</mark4><br>
Even dogs assail'd their masters, all save <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
And he was faithful to a corse, and <mark4>kept</mark4><br>
The birds and beasts and famish'd men at <mark3>bay,</mark3><br>
Till hunger clung them, or the dropping <mark4>dead</mark4><br>
Lur'd their lank jaws; himself sought out no <mark1>food,</mark1><br>
But with a piteous and perpetual <mark4>moan,</mark4><br>
And a quick desolate cry, licking the <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
Which answer'd not with a caress?he <mark4>died.</mark4><br>
The crowd was famish'd by degrees; but two<br>
Of an enormous city did <mark5>survive,</mark5><br>
And they were enemies: they met <mark3>beside</mark3><br>
The dying embers of an <mark4>altar-place</mark4><br>
Where had been heap'd a mass of holy <mark4>things</mark4><br>
For an unholy usage; they rak'd <mark1>up,</mark1><br>
And shivering scrap'd with their cold skeleton <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
The feeble ashes, and their feeble <mark3>breath</mark3><br>
Blew for a little life, and made a <mark4>flame</mark4><br>
Which was a mockery; then they lifted <mark1>up</mark1><br>
Their eyes as it grew lighter, and <mark4>beheld</mark4><br>
Each other's aspects?saw, and shriek'd, and <mark1>died?</mark1><br>
Even of their mutual hideousness they <mark1>died,</mark1><br>
Unknowing who he was upon whose brow<br>
Famine had written <mark4>Fiend</mark4>, The world was <mark4>void,</mark4><br>
The populous and the powerful was a <mark4>lump,</mark4><br>
Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, <mark4>lifeless?</mark4><br>
A lump of death?a chaos of hard <mark3>clay.</mark3><br>
The rivers, lakes and ocean all stood <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
And nothing stirr'd within their silent <mark4>depths;</mark4><br>
Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea,<br>
And their masts fell down piecemeal: as they dropp'd<br>
They slept on the abyss without a <mark5>surge?</mark5><br>
The waves were dead; the tides were in their <mark4>grave,</mark4><br>
The moon, their mistress, had expir'd <mark3>before;</mark3><br>
The winds were wither'd in the stagnant <mark1>air,</mark1><br>
And the clouds perish'd; Darkness had no <mark4>need</mark4><br>
Of aid from them?She was the <mark4>Universe.</mark4><br>
