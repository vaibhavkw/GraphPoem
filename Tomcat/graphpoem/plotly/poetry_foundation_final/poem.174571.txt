Title : Sestina <br>
Author : Algernon Charles Swinburne <br><br>

I saw my soul at rest upon a <mark3>day</mark3><br>
As a bird sleeping in the nest of <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
Among soft leaves that give the starlight <mark3>way</mark3><br>
To touch its wings but not its eyes with <mark3>light;</mark3><br>
So that it knew as one in visions <mark3>may,</mark3><br>
And knew not as men waking, of <mark3>delight.</mark3><br>
<br>
This was the measure of my soul's <mark1>delight;</mark1><br>
It had no power of joy to fly by <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
Nor part in the large lordship of the <mark1>light;</mark1><br>
But in a secret moon-beholden <mark1>way</mark1><br>
Had all its will of dreams and pleasant <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
And all the love and life that sleepers <mark1>may.</mark1><br>
<br>
But such life's triumph as men waking <mark1>may</mark1><br>
It might not have to feed its faint <mark1>delight</mark1><br>
Between the stars by night and sun by <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
Shut up with green leaves and a little <mark1>light;</mark1><br>
Because its way was as a lost star's <mark1>way,</mark1><br>
A world's not wholly known of day or <mark1>night.</mark1><br>
<br>
All loves and dreams and sounds and gleams of <mark1>night</mark1><br>
Made it all music that such minstrels <mark1>may,</mark1><br>
And all they had they gave it of <mark1>delight;</mark1><br>
But in the full face of the fire of <mark1>day</mark1><br>
What place shall be for any starry <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
What part of heaven in all the wide sun's <mark1>way?</mark1><br>
<br>
Yet the soul woke not, sleeping by the <mark1>way,</mark1><br>
Watched as a nursling of the large-eyed <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
And sought no strength nor knowledge of the <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
Nor closer touch conclusive of <mark1>delight,</mark1><br>
Nor mightier joy nor truer than dreamers <mark1>may,</mark1><br>
Nor more of song than they, nor more of <mark1>light.</mark1><br>
<br>
For who sleeps once and sees the secret <mark1>light</mark1><br>
Whereby sleep shows the soul a fairer <mark1>way</mark1><br>
Between the rise and rest of day and <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
Shall care no more to fare as all men <mark1>may,</mark1><br>
But be his place of pain or of <mark1>delight,</mark1><br>
There shall he dwell, beholding night as <mark1>day.</mark1><br>
<br>
Song, have thy day and take thy fill of <mark1>light</mark1><br>
Before the night be fallen across thy <mark1>way;</mark1><br>
Sing while he may, man hath no long <mark1>delight.</mark1><br>
