Title : At the Executed Murderer's Grave <br>
Author : James Wright <br><br>

for J. L. D.  Why should we do this? What good is it to us? Above all, how can we do such a thing? How can it possibly be <mark4>done?</mark4><br>
<br>
My name is James A. Wright, and I was <mark4>born</mark4><br>
<br>
Twenty-five miles from this infected <mark3>grave,</mark3><br>
In Martins Ferry, Ohio, where one <mark3>slave</mark3><br>
To Hazel-Atlas Glass became my <mark4>father.</mark4><br>
He tried to teach me kindness. I <mark4>return</mark4><br>
Only in memory now, aloof, <mark4>unhurried,</mark4><br>
To dead Ohio, where I might lie <mark4>buried,</mark4><br>
Had I not run away before my <mark3>time.</mark3><br>
Ohio caught George Doty. Clean as <mark3>lime,</mark3><br>
His skull rots empty here. Dying's the <mark4>best</mark4><br>
Of all the arts men learn in a dead <mark4>place.</mark4><br>
I walked here once. I made my loud <mark5>display,</mark5><br>
Leaning for language on a dead man's <mark4>voice.</mark4><br>
Now sick of lies, I turn to face the <mark4>past.</mark4><br>
I add my easy grievance to the <mark4>rest:</mark4><br>
Doty, if I confess I do not love <mark3>you,</mark3><br>
<br>
Will you let me alone? I burn for my own <mark4>lies.</mark4><br>
The nights electrocute my <mark4>fugitive,</mark4><br>
My <mark4>mind</mark4>, I run like the bewildered <mark4>mad</mark4><br>
At St. Clair Sanitarium, who <mark4>lurk,</mark4><br>
Arch and cunning, under the maple <mark4>trees,</mark4><br>
Pleased to be playing guilty after <mark4>dark.</mark4><br>
Staring to bed, they croon <mark4>self-lullabies.</mark4><br>
Doty, you make me sick. I am not <mark4>dead.</mark4><br>
I croon my tears at fifty cents per <mark4>line.</mark4><br>
Idiot, he demanded love from <mark4>girls,</mark4><br>
And murdered one. Also, he was a <mark3>thief.</mark3><br>
<br>
He left two women, and a ghost with <mark4>child.</mark4><br>
The hair, foul as a dog's upon his <mark4>head,</mark4><br>
Made such revolting Ohio <mark4>animals</mark4><br>
Fitter for vomit than a kind man's <mark3>grief.</mark3><br>
I waste no pity on the dead that <mark4>stink,</mark4><br>
And no love's lost between me and the <mark3>crying</mark3><br>
Drunks of Belaire, Ohio, where <mark4>police</mark4><br>
Kick at their kidneys till they die of <mark3>drink.</mark3><br>
Christ may restore them whole, for all of <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
Alive and dead, those giggling muckers <mark3>who</mark3><br>
Saddled my nightmares thirty years ago   <br>
Can do without my widely printed <mark3>sighing</mark3><br>
Over their pains with paid sincerity.   <br>
I do not pity the dead, I pity the <mark3>dying.</mark3><br>
I pity myself, because a man is <mark1>dead.</mark1><br>
If Belmont County killed him, what of <mark1>me?</mark1><br>
His victims never loved him. Why should <mark3>we?</mark3><br>
<br>
And yet, nobody had to kill him <mark4>either.</mark4><br>
It does no good to woo the grass, to <mark4>veil</mark4><br>
The quicklime hole of a man's defeat and <mark4>shame.</mark4><br>
Nature-lovers are gone. To hell with <mark4>them.</mark4><br>
I kick the clods away, and speak my <mark4>name.</mark4><br>
This grave's gash festers. Maybe it will <mark4>heal,</mark4><br>
When all are caught with what they had to <mark3>do</mark3><br>
In fear of love, when every man stands <mark4>still</mark4><br>
By the last <mark3>sea,</mark3><br>
<br>
And the princes of the sea come <mark4>down</mark4><br>
To lay away their robes, to judge the earth <br>
And its dead, and we dead stand undefended <mark4>everywhere,</mark4><br>
And my bodies--father and child and unskilled <mark4>criminal--</mark4><br>
Ridiculously kneel to bare my <mark4>scars,</mark4><br>
My sneaking <mark4>crimes</mark4>, to God's unpitying <mark3>stars.</mark3><br>
Staring politely, they will not mark my <mark4>face</mark4><br>
From any murderer's, buried in this <mark1>place.</mark1><br>
Why should they? We are nothing but a <mark4>man.</mark4><br>
Doty, the rapist and the <mark4>murderer,</mark4><br>
Sleeps in a ditch of <mark4>fire</mark4>, and cannot <mark4>hear;</mark4><br>
<br>
And where, in earth or hell's unholy <mark4>peace,</mark4><br>
Men's suicides will stop, God knows, not <mark3>I.</mark3><br>
Angels and pebbles mock me under <mark1>trees.</mark1><br>
Earth is a door I cannot even <mark1>face.</mark1><br>
<br>
Order be damned, I do not want to <mark3>die,</mark3><br>
Even to keep Belaire, Ohio, <mark4>safe.</mark4><br>
The hackles on my neck are fear, not <mark1>grief.</mark1><br>
(Open, dungeon! Open, roof of the <mark4>ground!)</mark4><br>
I hear the last sea in the Ohio <mark4>grass,</mark4><br>
Heaving a tide of gray <mark5>disastrousness.</mark5><br>
Wrinkles of winter ditch the rotted <mark1>face</mark1><br>
Of Doty, killer, imbecile, and <mark1>thief:</mark1><br>
Dirt of my flesh, <mark4>defeated</mark4>, <mark4>underground.</mark4><br>
