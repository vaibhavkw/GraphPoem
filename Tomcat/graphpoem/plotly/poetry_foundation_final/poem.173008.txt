Title : A Death in the Desert <br>
Author : Robert Browning <br><br>

[Supposed of Pamphylax the Antiochene: <br>
It is a parchment, of my rolls the <mark4>fifth,</mark4><br>
Hath three skins glued together, is all <mark3>Greek,</mark3><br>
And goeth from Epsilon down to <mark3>Mu:</mark3><br>
Lies second in the surnamed Chosen <mark3>Chest,</mark3><br>
Stained and conserved with juice of terebinth, <br>
Covered with cloth of hair, and lettered <mark3>Xi,</mark3><br>
From Xanthus, my wife's uncle, now at <mark4>peace:</mark4><br>
Mu and Epsilon stand for my own <mark4>name.</mark4><br>
I may not write it, but I make a <mark4>cross</mark4><br>
To show I wait His coming, with the <mark3>rest,</mark3><br>
And leave off here: beginneth Pamphylax.] <br>
<br>
I said, "If one should wet his lips with <mark4>wine,</mark4><br>
"And slip the broadest plantain-leaf we <mark4>find,</mark4><br>
"Or else the lappet of a linen <mark4>robe,</mark4><br>
"Into the water-vessel, lay it <mark4>right,</mark4><br>
"And cool his forehead just above the <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
"The while a brother, kneeling either <mark4>side,</mark4><br>
"Should chafe each hand and try to make it <mark4>warm,--</mark4><br>
"He is not so far gone but he might <mark3>speak."</mark3><br>
<br>
This did not happen in the outer <mark1>cave,</mark1><br>
Nor in the secret chamber of the <mark4>rock</mark4><br>
Where, sixty days since the decree was <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
We had him, bedded on a <mark4>camel-skin,</mark4><br>
And waited for his dying all the <mark4>while;</mark4><br>
But in the midmost grotto: since noon's <mark4>light</mark4><br>
Reached there a little, and we would not <mark4>lose</mark4><br>
The last of what might happen on his <mark4>face.</mark4><br>
I at the head, and Xanthus at the <mark4>feet,</mark4><br>
With Valens and the Boy, had lifted <mark4>him,</mark4><br>
And brought him from the chamber in the <mark4>depths,</mark4><br>
And laid him in the light where we might <mark3>see:</mark3><br>
For certain smiles began about his <mark4>mouth,</mark4><br>
And his lids <mark4>moved</mark4>, presageful of the <mark4>end.</mark4><br>
<br>
Beyond, and half way up the mouth o' the <mark1>cave</mark1><br>
The Bactrian convert, having his <mark3>desire,</mark3><br>
Kept watch, and made pretence to graze a <mark4>goat</mark4><br>
That gave us milk, on rags of various <mark4>herb,</mark4><br>
Plantain and quitch, the rocks' shade keeps <mark4>alive:</mark4><br>
So that if any thief or soldier <mark4>passed</mark4><br>
(Because the persecution was <mark4>aware,</mark4><br>
Yielding the goat up promptly with his <mark1>life,</mark1><br>
Such man might pass on, joyful at a <mark4>prize,</mark4><br>
Nor care to pry into the cool o' the <mark1>cave.</mark1><br>
Outside was all noon and the burning <mark3>blue.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Here is wine," answered Xanthus,--dropped a <mark4>drop;</mark4><br>
I stooped and placed the lap of cloth aright, <br>
Then chafed his right hand, and the Boy his <mark4>left:</mark4><br>
But Valens had bethought him, and <mark4>produced</mark4><br>
And broke a ball of nard, and made <mark4>perfume.</mark4><br>
Only, he did--not so much wake, as--turn <br>
And smile a little, as a sleeper <mark4>does</mark4><br>
If any dear one call him, touch his <mark1>face--</mark1><br>
And smiles and loves, but will not be <mark4>disturbed.</mark4><br>
<br>
Then Xanthus said a prayer, but still he <mark4>slept:</mark4><br>
It is the Xanthus that escaped to <mark4>Rome,</mark4><br>
Was burned, and could not write the <mark4>chronicle.</mark4><br>
<br>
Then the Boy sprang up from his knees, and <mark4>ran,</mark4><br>
Stung by the splendour of a sudden <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
And fetched the seventh plate of graven <mark4>lead</mark4><br>
Out of the secret chamber, found a <mark3>place,</mark3><br>
Pressing with finger on the deeper dints, <br>
And spoke, as 'twere his mouth proclaiming <mark4>first,</mark4><br>
"I am the Resurrection and the <mark1>Life."</mark1><br>
<br>
Whereat he opened his eyes wide at <mark4>once,</mark4><br>
And sat up of himself, and looked at <mark4>us;</mark4><br>
And thenceforth nobody pronounced a <mark4>word:</mark4><br>
Only, outside, the Bactrian cried his <mark3>cry</mark3><br>
Like the lone desert-bird that wears the <mark4>ruff,</mark4><br>
As signal we were safe, from time to <mark4>time.</mark4><br>
<br>
First he said, "If a friend declared to <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
"This my son Valens, this my other <mark4>son,</mark4><br>
"Were James and Peter,--nay, declared as <mark4>well</mark4><br>
"This lad was very John,--I could <mark4>believe!</mark4><br>
"--Could, for a moment, doubtlessly <mark1>believe:</mark1><br>
"So is myself withdrawn into my <mark1>depths,</mark1><br>
"The soul retreated from the perished <mark4>brain</mark4><br>
"Whence it was wont to feel and use the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
"Through these dull members, done with long <mark3>ago.</mark3><br>
"Yet I myself remain; I feel <mark4>myself:</mark4><br>
"And there is nothing lost. Let be, <mark4>awhile!"</mark4><br>
<br>
[This is the doctrine he was wont to <mark1>teach,</mark1><br>
How divers persons witness in each <mark4>man,</mark4><br>
Three souls which make up one soul: <mark4>first</mark4>, to <mark4>wit,</mark4><br>
A soul of each and all the bodily <mark4>parts,</mark4><br>
Seated therein, which works, and is what <mark1>Does,</mark1><br>
And has the use of earth, and ends the <mark1>man</mark1><br>
Downward: but, tending upward for <mark4>advice,</mark4><br>
Grows <mark1>into</mark1>, and again is grown <mark3>into</mark3><br>
By the next soul, which, seated in the <mark1>brain,</mark1><br>
Useth the first with its collected <mark4>use,</mark4><br>
And feeleth, thinketh, willeth,--is what <mark4>Knows:</mark4><br>
Which, duly tending upward in its <mark4>turn,</mark4><br>
Grows <mark1>into</mark1>, and again is grown <mark1>into</mark1><br>
By the last soul, that uses both the <mark1>first,</mark1><br>
Subsisting whether they assist or <mark3>no,</mark3><br>
And, constituting man's self, is what <mark4>Is--</mark4><br>
And leans upon the former, makes it <mark5>play,</mark5><br>
As that played off the first: and, tending <mark4>up,</mark4><br>
Holds, is upheld by, God, and ends the <mark1>man</mark1><br>
Upward in that dread point of <mark4>intercourse,</mark4><br>
Nor needs a place, for it returns to <mark1>Him.</mark1><br>
What Does, what Knows, what Is; three souls, one <mark1>man.</mark1><br>
I give the glossa of Theotypas.] <br>
<br>
And then, "A stick, once fire from end to <mark1>end;</mark1><br>
"Now, ashes save the tip that holds a <mark4>spark!</mark4><br>
"Yet, blow the spark, it runs back, spreads <mark3>itself</mark3><br>
"A little where the fire was: thus I <mark4>urge</mark4><br>
"The soul that served me, till it task once <mark4>more</mark4><br>
"What ashes of my brain have kept their <mark4>shape,</mark4><br>
"And these make effort on the last o' the <mark1>flesh,</mark1><br>
"Trying to taste again the truth of <mark4>things--"</mark4><br>
(He smiled)--"their very superficial <mark4>truth;</mark4><br>
"As that ye are my sons, that it is <mark4>long</mark4><br>
"Since James and Peter had release by <mark4>death,</mark4><br>
"And I am only he, your brother <mark4>John,</mark4><br>
"Who saw and heard, and could remember <mark4>all.</mark4><br>
"Remember all! It is not much to <mark3>say.</mark3><br>
"What if the truth broke on me from <mark4>above</mark4><br>
"As once and oft-times? Such might hap <mark4>again:</mark4><br>
"Doubtlessly He might stand in presence <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
"With head wool-white, eyes flame, and feet like <mark4>brass,</mark4><br>
"The sword and the seven stars, as I have <mark4>seen--</mark4><br>
"I who now shudder only and <mark4>surmise</mark4><br>
"How did your brother bear that sight and <mark4>live?'</mark4><br>
<br>
"If I live yet, it is for good, more <mark4>love</mark4><br>
"Through me to men: be nought but ashes <mark1>here</mark1><br>
"That keep awhile my semblance, who was <mark1>John,--</mark1><br>
"Still, when they scatter, there is left on <mark4>earth</mark4><br>
"No one alive who knew (consider <mark4>this!)</mark4><br>
"--Saw with his eyes and handled with his <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
"That which was from the first, the Word of <mark1>Life.</mark1><br>
"How will it be when none more saith 'I <mark1>saw'?</mark1><br>
<br>
"Such ever was love's way: to rise, it <mark4>stoops.</mark4><br>
"Since I, whom Christ's mouth taught, was bidden <mark1>teach,</mark1><br>
"I went, for many years, about the <mark1>world,</mark1><br>
"Saying 'It was so; so I heard and <mark1>saw,'</mark1><br>
"Speaking as the case asked: and men <mark4>believed.</mark4><br>
"Afterward came the message to <mark1>myself</mark1><br>
"In Patmos isle; I was not bidden <mark1>teach,</mark1><br>
"But simply listen, take a book and <mark4>write,</mark4><br>
"Nor set down other than the given <mark1>word,</mark1><br>
"With nothing left to my arbitrament <br>
"To choose or change: I wrote, and men <mark1>believed.</mark1><br>
"Then, for my time grew brief, no message <mark1>more,</mark1><br>
"No call to write again, I found a <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
"And, reasoning from my knowledge, merely <mark4>taught</mark4><br>
"Men should, for love's sake, in love's strength <mark1>believe;</mark1><br>
"Or I would pen a letter to a <mark4>friend</mark4><br>
"And urge the same as friend, nor less nor <mark1>more:</mark1><br>
"Friends said I reasoned rightly, and <mark1>believed.</mark1><br>
"But at the last, why, I seemed left <mark1>alive</mark1><br>
"Like a sea jelly weak on Patmos <mark4>strand,</mark4><br>
"To tell dry sea-beach gazers how I <mark4>fared</mark4><br>
"When there was mid-sea, and the mighty <mark1>things;</mark1><br>
"Left to repeat, 'I saw, I heard, I <mark3>knew,'</mark3><br>
"And go all over the old ground <mark1>again,</mark1><br>
"With Antichrist already in the <mark1>world,</mark1><br>
"And many Antichrists, who answered <mark4>prompt</mark4><br>
" Am I not Jasper as thyself art <mark1>John?</mark1><br>
" Nay, young, whereas through age thou mayest <mark4>forget;</mark4><br>
" Wherefore, explain, or how shall we <mark1>believe?</mark1><br>
"I never thought to call down fire on <mark4>such,</mark4><br>
"Or, as in wonderful and early <mark4>days,</mark4><br>
"Pick up the scorpion, tread the serpent <mark4>dumb;</mark4><br>
"But patient stated much of the Lord's <mark1>life</mark1><br>
"Forgotten or misdelivered, and let it <mark4>work:</mark4><br>
"Since much that at the first, in deed and <mark1>word,</mark1><br>
"Lay simply and sufficiently <mark4>exposed,</mark4><br>
"Had grown (or else my soul was grown to <mark4>match,</mark4><br>
"Fed through such years, familiar with such <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
"Guarded and guided still to see and <mark1>speak)</mark1><br>
"Of new significance and fresh <mark4>result;</mark4><br>
"What first were guessed as points, I now knew <mark4>stars,</mark4><br>
"And named them in the Gospel I have <mark4>writ.</mark4><br>
"For men said, 'It is getting long <mark1>ago:</mark1><br>
" Where is the promise of His <mark5>coming?'--asked</mark5><br>
"These young ones in their strength, as loth to <mark4>wait,</mark4><br>
"Of me who, when their sires were born, was <mark4>old.</mark4><br>
"I, for I loved them, answered, <mark4>joyfully,</mark4><br>
"Since I was there, and helpful in my <mark4>age;</mark4><br>
"And, in the main, I think such men <mark1>believed.</mark1><br>
"Finally, thus endeavouring, I fell <mark4>sick,</mark4><br>
"Ye brought me here, and I supposed the <mark1>end,</mark1><br>
"And went to sleep with one thought <mark4>that</mark4>, at <mark4>least,</mark4><br>
"Though the whole earth should lie in <mark4>wickedness,</mark4><br>
"We had the truth, might leave the rest to <mark4>God.</mark4><br>
"Yet now I wake in such <mark5>decrepitude</mark5><br>
"As I had slidden down and fallen <mark4>afar,</mark4><br>
"Past even the presence of my former <mark4>self,</mark4><br>
"Grasping the while for stay at facts which <mark4>snap,</mark4><br>
"Till I am found away from my own <mark1>world,</mark1><br>
Feeling for foot-hold through a blank <mark4>profound,</mark4><br>
"Along with unborn people in strange <mark4>lands,</mark4><br>
"Who say--I hear said or conceive they <mark1>say--</mark1><br>
" Was John at all, and did he say he <mark1>saw?</mark1><br>
" Assure us, ere we ask what he might <mark1>see!'</mark1><br>
<br>
"And how shall I assure them? Can they <mark4>share</mark4><br>
"--They, who have flesh, a veil of youth and <mark4>strength</mark4><br>
"About each spirit, that needs must bide its <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
"Living and learning still as years <mark4>assist</mark4><br>
"Which wear the thickness thin, and let man <mark1>see--</mark1><br>
"With me who hardly am withheld at <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
"But shudderingly, scarce a shred <mark4>between,</mark4><br>
"Lie bare to the universal prick of <mark1>light?</mark1><br>
"Is it for nothing we grow old and <mark4>weak,</mark4><br>
"We whom God loves? When pain ends, gain ends <mark3>too.</mark3><br>
"To me, that story--ay, that Life and <mark1>Death</mark1><br>
"Of which I wrote 'it was'--to me, it <mark1>is;</mark1><br>
"--Is, here and now: I apprehend nought <mark4>else.</mark4><br>
Is not God now i' the world His power first <mark4>made?</mark4><br>
"Is not His love at issue still with <mark4>sin,</mark4><br>
"Visibly when a wrong is done on <mark1>earth?</mark1><br>
"Love, wrong, and <mark4>pain</mark4>, what see I else <mark4>around?</mark4><br>
"Yea, and the Resurrection and <mark4>Uprise</mark4><br>
"To the right hand of the throne--what is it <mark4>beside,</mark4><br>
"When such truth, breaking bounds, o'erfloods my <mark4>soul,</mark4><br>
And, as I saw the sin and death, even <mark3>so</mark3><br>
"See I the need yet transiency of <mark4>both,</mark4><br>
"The good and glory consummated <mark4>thence?</mark4><br>
"I saw the power; I see the Love, once <mark1>weak,</mark1><br>
"Resume the Power: and in this word 'I <mark1>see,'</mark1><br>
"Lo, there is recognized the Spirit of <mark1>both</mark1><br>
"That moving o'er the spirit of man, <mark5>unblinds</mark5><br>
"His eye and bids him look. These are, I <mark1>see;</mark1><br>
"But ye, the children, His beloved ones <mark1>too,</mark1><br>
"Ye need,--as I should use an optic <mark4>glass</mark4><br>
I wondered at erewhile, somewhere i' the <mark1>world,</mark1><br>
"It had been given a crafty smith to <mark4>make;</mark4><br>
"A tube, he turned on objects brought too <mark4>close,</mark4><br>
Lying confusedly <mark4>insubordinate</mark4><br>
"For the unassisted eye to master <mark1>once:</mark1><br>
"Look through his tube, at distance now they <mark3>lay,</mark3><br>
"Become succinct, distinct, so small, so <mark4>clear!</mark4><br>
"Just thus, ye needs must apprehend what <mark1>truth</mark1><br>
"I see, reduced to plain historic <mark4>fact,</mark4><br>
"Diminished into clearness, proved a <mark4>point</mark4><br>
"And far away: ye would withdraw your <mark4>sense</mark4><br>
From out eternity, strain it upon <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
"Then stand before that fact, that Life and <mark1>Death,</mark1><br>
"Stay there at gaze, till it dispart, <mark5>dispread,</mark5><br>
As though a star should open out, all <mark4>sides,</mark4><br>
Grow the world on you, as it is my <mark1>world.</mark1><br>
<br>
"For life, with all it yields of joy and <mark3>woe</mark3><br>
"And hope and fear,--believe the aged <mark1>friend,--</mark1><br>
Is just our chance o' the prize of learning <mark1>love,</mark1><br>
"How love might be, hath been indeed, and <mark1>is;</mark1><br>
"And that we hold thenceforth to the uttermost <br>
"Such prize despite the envy of the <mark1>world,</mark1><br>
And, having gained truth, keep truth: that is <mark1>all.</mark1><br>
"But see the double way wherein we are <mark4>led,</mark4><br>
"How the soul learns diversely from the <mark1>flesh!</mark1><br>
"With flesh, that hath so little time to <mark3>stay,</mark3><br>
"And yields mere basement for the soul's <mark4>emprise,</mark4><br>
"Expect prompt teaching. Helpful was the <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
"And warmth was cherishing and food was <mark4>choice</mark4><br>
"To every man's flesh, thousand years <mark1>ago,</mark1><br>
"As now to yours and mine; the body <mark4>sprang</mark4><br>
"At once to the height, and stayed: but the <mark5>soul,--no!</mark5><br>
"Since sages who, this noontide, <mark4>meditate</mark4><br>
"In Rome or Athens, may descry some <mark1>point</mark1><br>
"Of the eternal power, hid yestereve; <br>
"And, as thereby the power's whole mass <mark4>extends,</mark4><br>
"So much extends the aether floating <mark4>o'er,</mark4><br>
"The love that tops the might, the Christ in <mark1>God.</mark1><br>
"Then, as new lessons shall be learned in <mark4>these</mark4><br>
"Till earth's work stop and useless time run <mark1>out,</mark1><br>
"So duly, <mark4>daily</mark4>, needs provision <mark3>be</mark3><br>
"For keeping the soul's prowess <mark4>possible,</mark4><br>
"Building new barriers as the old <mark3>decay,</mark3><br>
"Saving us from evasion of life's <mark4>proof,</mark4><br>
"Putting the question ever, 'Does God <mark1>love,</mark1><br>
" And will ye hold that truth against the <mark1>world?'</mark1><br>
"Ye know there needs no second proof with <mark4>good</mark4><br>
"Gained for our flesh from any earthly <mark4>source:</mark4><br>
"We might go freezing, ages,--give us <mark4>fire,</mark4><br>
"Thereafter we judge fire at its full <mark4>worth,</mark4><br>
"And guard it safe through every chance, ye <mark3>know!</mark3><br>
"That fable of Prometheus and his <mark4>theft,</mark4><br>
"How mortals gained Jove's fiery flower, grows <mark1>old</mark1><br>
"(I have been used to hear the pagans <mark4>own)</mark4><br>
"And out of mind; but fire, howe'er its <mark3>birth,</mark3><br>
"Here is it, precious to the sophist <mark1>now</mark1><br>
"Who laughs the myth of AEschylus to <mark4>scorn,</mark4><br>
"As precious to those satyrs of his <mark1>play,</mark1><br>
"Who touched it in gay wonder at the <mark4>thing.</mark4><br>
"While were it so with the soul,--this gift of <mark1>truth</mark1><br>
"Once grasped, were this our soul's gain safe, and <mark4>sure</mark4><br>
"To prosper as the body's gain is <mark4>wont,--</mark4><br>
"Why, man's probation would conclude, his <mark1>earth</mark1><br>
"Crumble; for he both reasons and <mark4>decides,</mark4><br>
"Weighs first, then chooses: will he give up <mark1>fire</mark1><br>
"For gold or purple once he knows its <mark1>worth?</mark1><br>
"Could he give Christ up were His worth as <mark4>plain?</mark4><br>
"Therefore, I say, to test man, the proofs <mark4>shift,</mark4><br>
"Nor may he grasp that fact like other <mark1>fact,</mark1><br>
"And straightway in his life acknowledge <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
"As, say, the indubitable bliss of <mark1>fire.</mark1><br>
"Sigh ye, 'It had been easier once than <mark1>now'?</mark1><br>
"To give you answer I am left <mark1>alive;</mark1><br>
"Look at me who was present from the <mark1>first!</mark1><br>
"Ye know what things I saw; then came a <mark4>test,</mark4><br>
"My first, befitting me who so had <mark1>seen:</mark1><br>
" Forsake the Christ thou sawest transfigured, <mark1>Him</mark1><br>
" Who trod the sea and brought the dead to <mark1>life?</mark1><br>
" What should wring this from thee!'--ye laugh and <mark4>ask.</mark4><br>
"What wrung it? Even a torchlight and a <mark4>noise,</mark4><br>
"The sudden Roman <mark4>faces</mark4>, violent <mark1>hands,</mark1><br>
"And fear of what the Jews might do! Just <mark4>that,</mark4><br>
"And it is written, 'I forsook and <mark4>fled':</mark4><br>
"There was my trial, and it ended <mark4>thus.</mark4><br>
"Ay, but my soul had gained its truth, could <mark3>grow:</mark3><br>
"Another year or two,--what little <mark4>child,</mark4><br>
"What tender woman that had seen no <mark1>least</mark1><br>
"Of all my sights, but barely heard them <mark4>told,</mark4><br>
"Who did not clasp the cross with a light <mark4>laugh,</mark4><br>
"Or wrap the burning robe <mark4>round</mark4>, thanking <mark1>God?</mark1><br>
"Well, was truth safe for ever, then? Not <mark1>so.</mark1><br>
"Already had begun the silent <mark1>work</mark1><br>
"Whereby truth, deadened of its absolute <mark4>blaze,</mark4><br>
"Might need love's eye to pierce the o'erstretched <mark4>doubt.</mark4><br>
"Teachers were busy, whispering 'All is <mark3>true</mark3><br>
" As the aged ones report; but youth can <mark4>reach</mark4><br>
" Where age gropes dimly, weak with stir and <mark4>strain,</mark4><br>
" And the full doctrine slumbers till <mark3>to-day.'</mark3><br>
"Thus, what the Roman's lowered spear was <mark4>found,</mark4><br>
"A bar to me who touched and handled <mark1>truth,</mark1><br>
"Now proved the glozing of some new shrewd <mark4>tongue,</mark4><br>
"This Ebion, this Cerinthus or their <mark4>mates,</mark4><br>
"Till imminent was the outcry Save our <mark4>Christ!'</mark4><br>
"Whereon I stated much of the Lord's <mark1>life</mark1><br>
"Forgotten or misdelivered, and let it <mark1>work.</mark1><br>
"Such work done, as it will be, what comes <mark4>next?</mark4><br>
"What do I hear <mark1>say</mark1>, or conceive men <mark1>say,</mark1><br>
" Was John at all, and did he say he <mark1>saw?</mark1><br>
" Assure us, ere we ask what he might <mark1>see!'</mark1><br>
<br>
"Is this indeed a burthen for late <mark1>days,</mark1><br>
"And may I help to bear it with you <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
"Using my weakness which becomes your <mark1>strength?</mark1><br>
"For if a babe were born inside this <mark5>grot,</mark5><br>
"Grew to a boy here, heard us praise the <mark4>sun,</mark4><br>
"Yet had but yon sole glimmer in light's <mark1>place,--</mark1><br>
"One loving him and wishful he should <mark4>learn,</mark4><br>
"Would much rejoice himself was blinded <mark1>first</mark1><br>
"Month by month here, so made to <mark4>understand</mark4><br>
"How eyes, born darkling, apprehend <mark4>amiss:</mark4><br>
"I think I could explain to such a <mark1>child</mark1><br>
"There was more glow outside than gleams he <mark4>caught,</mark4><br>
"Ay, nor need urge 'I saw it, so <mark1>believe!'</mark1><br>
"It is a heavy burthen you shall <mark4>bear</mark4><br>
"In latter days, new lands, or old grown <mark4>strange,</mark4><br>
"Left without me, which must be very <mark4>soon.</mark4><br>
"What is the <mark4>doubt</mark4>, my brothers? Quick with <mark1>it!</mark1><br>
"I see you stand conversing, each new <mark1>face,</mark1><br>
"Either in <mark4>fields</mark4>, of yellow summer <mark4>eves,</mark4><br>
"On islets yet unnamed amid the <mark2>sea;</mark2><br>
"Or pace for shelter 'neath a portico <br>
"Out of the crowd in some enormous <mark4>town</mark4><br>

" What truth was ever told the second <mark3>day?</mark3><br>
" Wonders, that would prove doctrine, go for nought. <br>
" Remains the doctrine, love; well, we must <mark1>love,</mark1><br>
" And what we love most, power and love in <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
" Let us acknowledge on the record <mark1>here,</mark1><br>
" Accepting these in Christ: must Christ then <mark1>be?</mark1><br>
" Has He been? Did not we ourselves make <mark1>Him?</mark1><br>
" Our mind receives but what it holds, no <mark1>more.</mark1><br>
" First of the love, then; we acknowledge <mark1>Christ--</mark1><br>
" A proof we comprehend His love, a <mark1>proof</mark1><br>
" We had such love already in <mark4>ourselves,</mark4><br>
" Knew first what else we should not <mark4>recognize.</mark4><br>
"   'Tis mere projection from man's inmost <mark4>mind,</mark4><br>
" And, what he loves, thus falls reflected <mark4>back,</mark4><br>
" Becomes accounted somewhat out of <mark1>him;</mark1><br>
" He throws it up in air, it drops down <mark4>earth's,</mark4><br>
" With shape, name, story added, man's old <mark1>way.</mark1><br>
" How prove you Christ came otherwise at <mark1>least?</mark1><br>
" Next try the power: He made and rules the <mark1>world:</mark1><br>
" Certes there is a world <mark4>onc</mark4>, made, now <mark4>ruled,</mark4><br>
" Unless things have been ever as we <mark1>see.</mark1><br>
" Our sires declared a charioteer's yoked <mark4>steeds</mark4><br>
" Brought the sun up the east and down the <mark4>west,</mark4><br>
" Which only of itself now rises, <mark4>sets,</mark4><br>
" As if a hand impelled it and a <mark4>will,--</mark4><br>
" Thus they long thought, they who had will and <mark1>hands:</mark1><br>
" But the new question's whisper is <mark4>distinct,</mark4><br>
" Wherefore must all force needs be like <mark1>ourselves?</mark1><br>
" We have the hands, the will; what made and <mark4>drives</mark4><br>
" The sun is force, is law, is named, not <mark4>known,</mark4><br>
" While will and love we do know; marks of <mark1>these,</mark1><br>
" Eye-witnesses attest, so books <mark4>declare--</mark4><br>
" As that, to punish or reward our <mark4>race,</mark4><br>
" The sun at undue times arose or <mark4>set</mark4><br>
" Or else stood still: what do not men <mark4>affirm?</mark4><br>
" But earth requires as urgently <mark4>reward</mark4><br>
" Or punishment to-day as years <mark1>ago,</mark1><br>
" And none expects the sun will <mark4>interpose:</mark4><br>
" Therefore it was mere passion and <mark4>mistake,</mark4><br>
" Or erring zeal for right, which changed the <mark1>truth.</mark1><br>
" Go back, far, farther, to the birth of <mark1>things;</mark1><br>
" Ever the will, the intelligence, the <mark1>love,</mark1><br>
" Man's!--which <mark4>h</mark4>, gives, supposing he but <mark4>finds,</mark4><br>
" As late he gave head, body, hands and <mark1>feet,</mark1><br>
" To help these in what forms he called his <mark4>gods.</mark4><br>
" First, Jove's brow, Juno's eyes were swept <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
" But Jove's wrath, Juno's pride continued <mark1>long;</mark1><br>
" As last, will, power, and love discarded <mark1>these,</mark1><br>
" So law in turn discards power, love, and <mark1>will.</mark1><br>
" What proveth God is otherwise at <mark1>least?</mark1><br>
" All else, projection from the mind of <mark1>man!'</mark1><br>
<br>
"Nay, do not give me wine, for I am <mark3>strong,</mark3><br>
"But place my gospel where I put my <mark1>hands.</mark1><br>
<br>
"I say that man was made to grow, not <mark4>stop;</mark4><br>
"That help, he needed once, and needs no <mark1>more,</mark1><br>
"Having grown but an inch by, is <mark4>withdrawn:</mark4><br>
"For he hath new <mark4>needs</mark4>, and new helps to <mark1>these.</mark1><br>
"This imports solely, man should mount on <mark3>each</mark3><br>
"New height in view; the help whereby he <mark4>mounts,</mark4><br>
"The ladder-rung his foot has left, may <mark4>fall,</mark4><br>
"Since all things suffer change save God the <mark1>Truth.</mark1><br>
<br>
"Man apprehends Him newly at each <mark4>stage</mark4><br>
"Whereat earth's ladder drops, its service <mark4>done;</mark4><br>
"And nothing shall prove twice what once was <mark4>proved.</mark4><br>
"You stick a garden-plot with ordered <mark4>twigs</mark4><br>
"To show inside lie germs of herbs <mark4>unborn,</mark4><br>
"And check the careless step would spoil their <mark1>birth;</mark1><br>

"Which proved once underneath lay store of <mark4>seed,</mark4><br>
"But to the herb's self, by what light ye <mark4>boast,</mark4><br>
"For what fruit's signs are. This book's fruit is <mark1>plain,</mark1><br>
"Nor miracles need prove it any <mark1>more.</mark1><br>
"Doth the fruit show? Then miracles bade 'ware <br>
"At first of root and stem, saved both till <mark1>now</mark1><br>
"From trampling ox, rough boar and wanton <mark1>goat.</mark1><br>
"What? Was man made a wheelwork to wind <mark1>up,</mark1><br>
"And be discharged, and straight wound up <mark3>anew?</mark3><br>
"No!--grown, his growth lasts; taught, he ne'er <mark4>forgets:</mark4><br>
"May learn a thousand things, not twice the <mark4>same.</mark4><br>
<br>
"This might be pagan teaching: now hear <mark4>mine.</mark4><br>
<br>
"I say, that as the babe, you feed <mark1>awhile,</mark1><br>

"So, minds at first must be spoon-fed with <mark1>truth:</mark1><br>
"When they can eat, babe's-nurture is <mark1>withdrawn.</mark1><br>
"I fed the babe whether it would or <mark1>no:</mark1><br>
"I bid the boy or feed himself or <mark4>starve.</mark4><br>
"I cried once, 'That ye may believe in <mark1>Christ,</mark1><br>
" Behold this blind man shall receive his <mark4>sight!'</mark4><br>
"I cry now, 'Urgest thou, for I am <mark4>shrewd</mark4><br>
" And smile at stories how John's word could <mark4>cure--</mark4><br>
" Repeat that miracle and take my <mark4>faith?'</mark4><br>
"I say, that miracle was duly <mark4>wrought</mark4><br>
"When, save for it, no faith was <mark1>possible.</mark1><br>
"Whether a change were wrought i' the shows o' the <mark1>world,</mark1><br>
"Whether the change came from our minds which <mark1>see</mark1><br>
"Of shows o' the world so much as and no <mark1>more</mark1><br>
"Than God wills for His purpose,--(what do <mark3>I</mark3><br>
"See now, suppose you, there where you see <mark1>rock</mark1><br>
"Round us?)--I know <mark4>not</mark4>, such was the <mark4>effect,</mark4><br>
"So faith grew, making void more <mark4>miracles</mark4><br>
"Because too much; they would compel, not <mark4>help.</mark4><br>
"I say, the acknowledgment of God in <mark1>Christ</mark1><br>
"Accepted by thy reason, solves for <mark3>thee</mark3><br>
"All questions in the earth and out of <mark1>it,</mark1><br>

"Leave knowledge and revert to how it <mark4>sprung?</mark4><br>
"Thou hast it; use it and forthwith, or <mark3>die!</mark3><br>

"That man has turned round on himself and <mark4>stands,</mark4><br>

" And evermore, plain truth from man to <mark1>man.</mark1><br>
" Is John's procedure just the heathen <mark4>bard's?</mark4><br>
" Put question of his famous play <mark1>again</mark1><br>
" How for the ephemerals' sake Jove's fire was <mark4>filched,</mark4><br>

" Nor tell the whole truth in the proper <mark4>words?'</mark4><br>
<br>
"I answer, Have ye yet to argue <mark1>out</mark1><br>
"The very primal thesis, plainest <mark3>law,</mark3><br>
"--Man is not God but hath God's end to <mark4>serve,</mark4><br>
"A master to obey, a course to <mark3>take,</mark3><br>
"Somewhat to cast off, somewhat to <mark4>become?</mark4><br>
"Grant this, then man must pass from old to <mark3>new,</mark3><br>
"From vain to real, from mistake to <mark1>fact,</mark1><br>
"From what once seemed good, to what now proves <mark4>best.</mark4><br>
"How could man have progression <mark4>otherwise?</mark4><br>
"Before the point was mooted 'What is <mark1>God?'</mark1><br>
"No savage man inquired 'What am <mark1>myself?'</mark1><br>
"Much less replied, First, last, and best of <mark1>things.'</mark1><br>
"Man takes that title now if he <mark4>believes</mark4><br>
"Might can exist with neither will nor <mark1>love,</mark1><br>
"In God's case--what he names now Nature's <mark1>Law--</mark1><br>
"While in himself he recognizes <mark1>love</mark1><br>
"No less than might and will: and rightly <mark4>takes.</mark4><br>
"Since if man prove the sole existent <mark1>thing</mark1><br>
"Where these combine, whatever their <mark3>degree,</mark3><br>
"However weak the might or will or <mark1>love,</mark1><br>
"So they be found there, put in <mark4>evidence,--</mark4><br>
"He is as surely higher in the <mark3>scale</mark3><br>
"Than any might with neither love nor <mark1>will,</mark1><br>
"As life, apparent in the poorest <mark4>midge,</mark4><br>
"(When the faint dust-speck flits, ye guess its <mark3>wing)</mark3><br>
"Is marvellous beyond dead Atlas' <mark1>self--</mark1><br>
"Given to the nobler midge for <mark4>resting-place!</mark4><br>
"Thus, man proves best and highest--God, in <mark4>fine,</mark4><br>
"And thus the victory leads but to <mark4>defeat,</mark4><br>
"The gain to loss, best rise to the worst <mark1>fall,</mark1><br>
"His life becomes impossible, which is <mark1>death.</mark1><br>
<br>
"But if, appealing thence, he cower, avouch <br>
"He is mere man, and in <mark4>humility</mark4><br>
"Neither may know God nor mistake <mark1>himself;</mark1><br>
"I point to the immediate <mark4>consequence</mark4><br>
"And say, by such confession straight he <mark4>falls</mark4><br>
"Into man's place, a thing nor God nor <mark4>beast,</mark4><br>

"Lower than God who knows all and can <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
"Higher than beasts which know and can so <mark4>far</mark4><br>
"As each beast's limit, perfect to an <mark1>end,</mark1><br>
"Nor conscious that they know, nor craving <mark1>more;</mark1><br>
"While man knows partly but conceives <mark1>beside,</mark1><br>
"Creeps ever on from fancies to the <mark1>fact,</mark1><br>
"And in this striving, this converting <mark4>air</mark4><br>
"Into a solid he may grasp and <mark1>use,</mark1><br>
"Finds progress, man's distinctive mark <mark4>alone,</mark4><br>
"Not God's, and not the beasts': God is, they <mark4>are,</mark4><br>
"Man partly is and wholly hopes to <mark1>be.</mark1><br>
"Such progress could no more attend his <mark1>soul</mark1><br>
"Were all it struggles after found at <mark1>first</mark1><br>

"Than motion wait his body, were all <mark1>else</mark1><br>
"Than it the solid earth on every <mark1>side,</mark1><br>

"Set to instruct himself by his past <mark1>self:</mark1><br>
"First, like the brute, obliged by facts to <mark1>learn,</mark1><br>
"Next, as man may, obliged by his own <mark1>mind,</mark1><br>
"Bent, habit, nature, knowledge turned to <mark1>law.</mark1><br>

"Rather commend him that he clapped his <mark1>hands,</mark1><br>

Either mistaking what was darkly <mark4>spoke</mark4><br>
At ending of his book, as he <mark4>relates,</mark4><br>
Or misconceiving somewhat of this <mark4>speech</mark4><br>
Scattered from mouth to mouth, as I <mark4>suppose.</mark4><br>
Believe ye will not see him any <mark1>more</mark1><br>
About the world with his divine <mark4>regard!</mark4><br>
For all was as I say, and now the <mark1>man</mark1><br>
Lies as he lay once, breast to breast with <mark1>God.</mark1><br>

[Cerinthus read and mused; one added <mark1>this:</mark1><br>
<br>
"If Christ, as thou affirmest, be of <mark4>men</mark4><br>
"Mere man, the first and best but nothing <mark1>more,--</mark1><br>
"Account Him, for reward of what He <mark4>was,</mark4><br>
"Now and for ever, wretchedest of <mark1>all.</mark1><br>
"For see; Himself conceived of life as <mark1>love,</mark1><br>
"Conceived of love as what must enter <mark4>in,</mark4><br>
"Fill up, make one with His each soul He <mark1>loved.</mark1><br>
"Thus much for man's joy, all men's joy for <mark1>Him.</mark1><br>
"Well, He is gone, thou sayest, to fit <mark1>reward.</mark1><br>
"But by this time are many souls set <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
"And very many still retained <mark1>alive:</mark1><br>
"Nay, should His coming be delayed <mark1>awhile,</mark1><br>
"Say, ten years longer (twelve years, some <mark4>compute)</mark4><br>
"See if, for every finger of thy <mark1>hands,</mark1><br>
"There be not <mark4>found</mark4>, that day the world shall <mark1>end,</mark1><br>
"Hundreds of souls, each holding by Christ's <mark1>word</mark1><br>
"That He will grow incorporate with <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
"With me as Pamphylax, with him as <mark1>John,</mark1><br>
"Groom for each bride!  Can a mere man do <mark1>this?</mark1><br>
"Yet Christ saith, this He lived and died to <mark3>do.</mark3><br>
"Call Christ, then, the illimitable <mark1>God,</mark1><br>
"Or <mark4>lost!"</mark4><br>
