Title : The Intellectual <br>
Author : Karl Shapiro <br><br>

What should the wars do with these jigging <mark4>fools?</mark4><br>
The man behind the book may not be <mark3>man,</mark3><br>
His own man or the book's or yet the <mark4>time's,</mark4><br>
But still be whole, deciding what he <mark3>can</mark3><br>
In praise of politics or German <mark3>rimes;</mark3><br>
<br>
But the intellectual lights a <mark3>cigarette</mark3><br>
And offers it lit to the lady, whose odd <mark3>smile</mark3><br>
Is the merest hyphen?lest he should <mark3>forget</mark3><br>
What he has been resuming all the <mark3>while.</mark3><br>
<br>
He talks to overhear, she to <mark3>withdraw</mark3><br>
To some interior feminine <mark4>fireside</mark4><br>
Where the back arches, beauty puts forth a <mark3>paw</mark3><br>
Like a black puma stretching in velvet <mark4>pride,</mark4><br>
<br>
Making him think of cats, a stray of <mark5>which</mark5><br>
Some days sets up a howling in his <mark4>brain,</mark4><br>
Pure interference such as this neat <mark3>bitch</mark3><br>
Seems to create from listening <mark3>disdain.</mark3><br>
<br>
But talk is all the value, the <mark4>release,</mark4><br>
Talk is the very fillip of an <mark4>act,</mark4><br>
The frame and subject of the <mark4>masterpiece</mark4><br>
Under whose film of age the face is <mark3>cracked.</mark3><br>
<br>
His own forehead glows like expensive <mark4>wood,</mark4><br>
But back of it the mind is <mark4>disengaged,</mark4><br>
Self-sealing clock recording bad and <mark4>good</mark4><br>
At constant temperature, intact, unaged.<br>
<br>
But strange, his body is an open <mark4>house</mark4><br>
Inviting every passerby to <mark3>stay;</mark3><br>
The city to and fro beneath his <mark4>brows</mark4><br>
Wanders and drinks and chats from night to <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
<br>
Think of a private thought, indecent <mark3>room</mark3><br>
Where one might kiss his daughter before <mark4>bed!</mark4><br>
Life is embarrassed; shut the family <mark3>tomb,</mark3><br>
Console your neighbor for his recent <mark3>dead;</mark3><br>
<br>
Do something! die in Spain or paint a <mark4>green</mark4><br>
Gouache, go into business (Rimbaud <mark4>did),</mark4><br>
Or start another Little <mark4>Magazine,</mark4><br>
Or move in with a woman, have a <mark3>kid.</mark3><br>
<br>
Invulnerable, impossible, <mark4>immune,</mark4><br>
Do what you will, your will will not be <mark4>done</mark4><br>
But dissipate the light of <mark4>afternoon</mark4><br>
Till evening flickers like the midnight <mark4>sun,</mark4><br>
<br>
And midnight shouts and dies: I'd rather <mark3>be</mark3><br>
A milkman walking in his sleep at <mark4>dawn</mark4><br>
Bearing fat quarts of cream, and so be <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
Crossing alone and cold from lawn to <mark3>lawn.</mark3><br>
<br>
I'd rather be a barber and cut <mark3>hair</mark3><br>
Than walk with you in gilt museum <mark4>halls,</mark4><br>
You and the puma-lady, she so <mark3>rare</mark3><br>
Exhaling her silk soul upon the <mark3>walls.</mark3><br>
<br>
Go take yourselves apart, but let me <mark1>be</mark1><br>
The fault you find with everyman. I <mark4>spit,</mark4><br>
I laugh, I fight; and you, l'homme qui rit;<br>
Swallow your stale saliva, and still <mark3>sit.</mark3><br>
