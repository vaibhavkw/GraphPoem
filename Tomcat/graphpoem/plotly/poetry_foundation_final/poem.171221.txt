Title : "What Do Women Want?" <br>
Author : Kim Addonizio <br><br>

I want a red <mark4>dress.</mark4><br>
I want it flimsy and cheap, <br>
I want it too <mark4>tight</mark4>, I want to wear <mark4>it</mark4><br>
until someone tears it off <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
I want it sleeveless and <mark4>backless,</mark4><br>
this <mark3>dress</mark3>, so no one has to <mark4>guess</mark4><br>
what's underneath. I want to walk <mark4>down</mark4><br>
the street past Thrifty's and the hardware store   <br>
with all those keys glittering in the window,   <br>
past Mr. and Mrs. Wong selling <mark4>day-old</mark4><br>
donuts in their cafe, past the Guerra <mark4>brothers</mark4><br>
slinging pigs from the truck and onto the <mark4>dolly,</mark4><br>
hoisting the slick snouts over their <mark4>shoulders.</mark4><br>
I want to walk like I'm the <mark4>only</mark4><br>
woman on earth and I can have my pick.   <br>
I want that red dress <mark4>bad.</mark4><br>
I want it to confirm <br>
your worst fears about <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
to show you how little I care about <mark3>you</mark3><br>
or anything except <mark4>what</mark4><br>
I want. When I find <mark4>it</mark4>, I'll pull that <mark4>garment</mark4><br>
from its hanger like I'm choosing a <mark4>body</mark4><br>
to carry me into this world, <mark3>through</mark3><br>
the birth-cries and the love-cries <mark3>too,</mark3><br>
and I'll wear it like bones, like <mark4>skin,</mark4><br>
it'll be the <mark4>goddamned</mark4><br>
dress they bury me <mark3>in.</mark3><br>
