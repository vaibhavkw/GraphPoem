Title : A Swimmer in the Air <br>
Author : Howard Moss <br><br>

That sea we see of <mark4>surfaces</mark4><br>
Turned upside down would be another <mark3>world:</mark3><br>
A bone shop, soaked in pearl, a <mark3>dumping-</mark3><br>
Ground for rarities, the sea-maws <mark3>pumping</mark3><br>
Grecian garbage Roman cities <mark3>hurled</mark3><br>
Seaward westward toward our <mark4>faces.</mark4><br>
<br>
That sea would yield up secret <mark4>farms,</mark4><br>
Gray-rotted by itself, encrusted <mark4>thick</mark4><br>
With unimaginable wealth, the <mark4>spoil</mark4><br>
Of deaf-mute drownings, the <mark4>immemorial</mark4><br>
Dead, floating in a blue-green <mark4>bailiwick</mark4><br>
Of nun-like plants waving <mark3>arms.</mark3><br>
<br>
       That sea will not turn over. See<br>
In its deepest keep, far from its <mark4>shallow,</mark4><br>
The formal, hidden iceberg, slant, <mark4>oblique</mark4><br>
With pregnancy below, thrust up its <mark3>peak--</mark3><br>
Like ourselves in the water-beasted <mark4>wallow,</mark4><br>
       Caught in a cellular ecstasy.<br>
<br>
In the same vein, all flesh <mark4>conceals</mark4><br>
Articulation's fishnet, whose <mark4>thread-bones</mark4><br>
(A metaphysic harp from sky to <mark4>heel)</mark4><br>
Hang in the flesh that dangles from the <mark3>creel</mark3><br>
Depending from the weedy Hand that <mark3>owns</mark3><br>
All fishnets and all fishing <mark4>reels.</mark4><br>
<br>
His answers breed a further <mark4>question:</mark4><br>
The fingernails of scale a snake will <mark4>shed</mark4><br>
In spring, coil after coil, on moistened <mark3>clay,</mark3><br>
Though similar to the serpent wriggling <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
Are but facsimiles, though not quite <mark3>dead.</mark3><br>
Testing this, see how the rest <mark4>shun</mark4><br>
<br>
Drying memorials to that <mark3>race</mark3><br>
That mined our viewpoint in the <mark4>Garden,</mark4><br>
Whose inching tape maneuvered in the <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
To measure every guilty length of <mark4>Eden.</mark4><br>
Man is an animal that needs a <mark4>warden</mark4><br>
To frighten off the Master's <mark3>face,</mark3><br>
<br>
For even an idiot sees a <mark1>world</mark1><br>
No tree or dog would dream of, finds a <mark3>name</mark3><br>
For pain or absence of it, marries <mark4>love</mark4><br>
Of one kind of another. In his <mark4>grove,</mark4><br>
Insensible fruit trees and wild <mark3>game</mark3><br>
Grow naturally, though he lies <mark3>curled,</mark3><br>
<br>
The spit and image of our <mark3>wish,</mark3><br>
   Smoking a pipe, with an ice-cold Cola<br>
Clutched in one <mark4>hand</mark4>, and the Sundy funnies <mark4>spread</mark4><br>
On both his knees. He'll leave his lurching <mark3>bed</mark3><br>
   To throw hot jazz on an old victrola--<br>
A far cry from the primal <mark3>fish</mark3><br>
<br>
Whose fine-boned spine our back <mark4>remembers:</mark4><br>
The river bottoms, and the sea-silt <mark3>soft</mark3><br>
As soup, the mudflats where night crawlers <mark3>came,</mark3><br>
Tempted by the water tops to change the <mark3>lame</mark3><br>
Arrangements, making of the air a <mark3>loft</mark3><br>
Fitted to our brackish <mark3>members,</mark3><br>
<br>
And out we <mark4>clambered</mark4>, eyeing <mark4>land,</mark4><br>
Our moist eyes focused on the moron <mark4>green,</mark4><br>
Hot on our backs abnormal dryness, <mark5>shadow</mark5><br>
Forming in the seanets, seaweed into <mark3>meadow,</mark3><br>
Finally landing at the foot of <mark4>pine,</mark4><br>
Heavy with salty <mark4>contraband</mark4><br>
<br>
While the birds beautifully beat <mark3>blue</mark3><br>
On erect wings, as magically they <mark4>soared,</mark4><br>
Feathered and efficient, from tallest trees to <mark4>stake</mark4><br>
A claim so ravishing that now we <mark4>undertake</mark4><br>
To map an area we once <mark3>ignored,</mark3><br>
Still exiles from that upper <mark3>view,</mark3><br>
<br>
For, mummers of the ocean's <mark4>Word,</mark4><br>
Our dry translations tidied from the <mark3>deep,</mark3><br>
Bespeak its ancient languages. The <mark4>salt</mark4><br>
Our tears and blood must harbor from its <mark3>vault</mark3><br>
Is shed on every beach-head where we <mark3>creep,</mark3><br>
Part man, dry fish, and wingless <mark3>bird.</mark3><br>
