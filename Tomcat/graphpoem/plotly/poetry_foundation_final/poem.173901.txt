Author : Henry Wadsworth Longfellow <br><br>

The young Endymion sleeps Endymion's <mark3>sleep;</mark3><br>
The shepherd-boy whose tale was left half <mark3>told!</mark3><br>
The solemn grove uplifts its shield of <mark3>gold</mark3><br>
To the red rising moon, and loud and <mark3>deep</mark3><br>
The nightingale is singing from the <mark3>steep;</mark3><br>
It is midsummer, but the air is <mark3>cold;</mark3><br>
Can it be death? Alas, beside the <mark3>fold</mark3><br>
A shepherd's pipe lies shattered near his <mark3>sheep.</mark3><br>
Lo! in the moonlight gleams a marble <mark3>white,</mark3><br>
On which I read: "Here lieth one whose <mark3>name</mark3><br>
      Was writ in water." And was this the meed <br>
Of his sweet singing? Rather let me <mark3>write:</mark3><br>
"The smoking flax before it burst to <mark3>flame</mark3><br>
Was quenched by death, and broken the bruised <mark4>reed."</mark4><br>
