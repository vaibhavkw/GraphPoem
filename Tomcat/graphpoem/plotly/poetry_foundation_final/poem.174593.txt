Title : from Idylls of the King: Song from The Marriage of Geraint <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel, and lower the <mark3>proud;</mark3><br>
Turn thy wild wheel thro' sunshine, storm, and <mark3>cloud;</mark3><br>
Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor <mark3>hate.</mark3><br>
<br>
Turn, <mark4>Fortune</mark4>, turn thy wheel with smile or <mark4>frown;</mark4><br>
With that wild wheel we go not up or <mark3>down;</mark3><br>
Our hoard is little, but our hearts are <mark3>great.</mark3><br>
<br>
Smile and we smile, the lords of many <mark3>lands;</mark3><br>
Frown and we smile, the lords of our own <mark3>hands;</mark3><br>
For man is man and master of his <mark3>fate.</mark3><br>
<br>
Turn, turn thy wheel above the staring <mark3>crowd;</mark3><br>
Thy wheel and thou are shadows in the <mark1>cloud;</mark1><br>
Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor <mark1>hate.</mark1><br>
