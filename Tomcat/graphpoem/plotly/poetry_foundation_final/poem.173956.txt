Title : The Pilgrims <br>
Author : John McCrae <br><br>

<br>
An uphill path, sun-gleams between the <mark3>showers,</mark3><br>
Where every beam that broke the leaden <mark3>sky</mark3><br>
Lit other hills with fairer ways than <mark3>ours;</mark3><br>
Some clustered graves where half our memories <mark3>lie;</mark3><br>
And one grim Shadow creeping ever <mark3>nigh:</mark3><br>
And this was <mark1>Life.</mark1><br>
<br>
Wherein we did another's burden <mark3>seek,</mark3><br>
The tired feet we helped upon the <mark3>road,</mark3><br>
The hand we gave the weary and the <mark3>weak,</mark3><br>
The miles we lightened one another's <mark3>load,</mark3><br>
When, faint to falling, onward yet we <mark3>strode:</mark3><br>
This too was <mark1>Life.</mark1><br>
<br>
Till, at the upland, as we turned to <mark3>go</mark3><br>
Amid fair meadows, dusky in the <mark5>night,</mark5><br>
The mists fell back upon the road <mark3>below;</mark3><br>
Broke on our tired eyes the western <mark3>light;</mark3><br>
The very graves were for a moment <mark3>bright:</mark3><br>
        And this was Death.<br>
