Title : Business <br>
Author : A. F. Moritz <br><br>

Stiff, thick: the white hair of the broad-faced <mark4>father,</mark4><br>
who leads his shambling son <mark4>along</mark4><br>
cracked sidewalks, by dusty glass half <mark4>hiding</mark4><br>
goods never sold. The son is the taller <mark4>one</mark4><br>
but still a child: not aware of his <mark4>clothes,</mark4><br>
of what expressions seize on his soft <mark4>face.</mark4><br>
His gait lolls, loosely directed from some <mark4>weak,</mark4><br>
distant center, scarcely devoted to any <mark4>purpose</mark4><br>
but following along and looking. Thick lenses <mark4>glint</mark4><br>
with watery blue: his small eyes, <mark4>veiled</mark4><br>
and placid, as far off as the milky August sky. <br>
The father, all the time glancing at him and <mark4>talking</mark4><br>
as man to man, seems to forget it would be <mark4>better</mark4><br>
for this one to have been like all the <mark4>rest.</mark4><br>
He has his son still with him, the <mark4>others</mark4><br>
have grown up and gone away--but when he <mark4>dies,</mark4><br>
then what will happen to the boy? Even this <mark4>thought</mark4><br>
is absorbed now in their ordinary <mark4>errand,</mark4><br>
men's business: grateful going out through the day, <br>
talk with the owners, the salesmen, a <mark4>mechanic</mark4><br>
in the scent of grease and sawdust of machined metal, <br>
the sifting through tools and parts that flow, spill, gleam <br>
like seeds, like sand--looking for what <mark4>fits,</mark4><br>
finding what will work. Afterwards to stop for <mark4>food,</mark4><br>
then walk back home down the clear streets, when starlings, <br>
hunting and restless before sleep, and <mark4>children</mark4><br>
are the loudest things, with the dark <mark4>foaming</mark4><br>
among maples, glinting, as it comes <mark4>in.</mark4><br>
