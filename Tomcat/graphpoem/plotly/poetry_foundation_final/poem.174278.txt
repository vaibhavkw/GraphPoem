Title : The House of Life: 41. Through Death to Love <br>
Author : Dante Gabriel Rossetti <br><br>

Like labour-laden moonclouds faint to <mark3>flee</mark3><br>
From winds that sweep the winter-bitten <mark4>wold,?</mark4><br>
Like multiform circumfluence <mark4>manifold</mark4><br>
Of night's flood-tide,?like terrors that <mark3>agree</mark3><br>
Of hoarse-tongued fire and inarticulate <mark3>sea,?</mark3><br>
Even such, within some glass dimm'd by our <mark3>breath,</mark3><br>
Our hearts discern wild images of <mark3>Death,</mark3><br>
Shadows and shoals that edge eternity.<br>
<br>
Howbeit athwart Death's imminent shade doth <mark3>soar</mark3><br>
One Power, than flow of stream or flight of <mark3>dove</mark3><br>
Sweeter to glide around, to brood <mark3>above.</mark3><br>
Tell me, my heart,?what angel-greeted <mark3>door</mark3><br>
Or threshold of wing-winnow'd <mark3>threshing-floor</mark3><br>
Hath guest fire-fledg'd as thine, whose lord is <mark3>Love?</mark3><br>
