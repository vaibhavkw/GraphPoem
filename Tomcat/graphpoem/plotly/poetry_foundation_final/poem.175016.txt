Title : Paradise Lost: Book 11 (1674 version) <br>
Author : John Milton <br><br>

THus they in lowliest plight repentant <mark4>stood</mark4><br>
Praying, for from the Mercie-seat <mark4>above</mark4><br>
Prevenient Grace descending had <mark1>remov'd</mark1><br>
The stonie from thir hearts, & made new <mark5>flesh</mark5><br>
Regenerate grow instead, that sighs now <mark4>breath'd</mark4><br>
Unutterable, which the Spirit of <mark3>prayer</mark3><br>
Inspir'd, and wing'd for Heav'n with speedier <mark4>flight</mark4><br>
Then loudest Oratorie: yet thir <mark4>port</mark4><br>
Not of mean suiters, nor important <mark4>less</mark4><br>
Seem'd thir Petition, then when th' ancient <mark3>Pair</mark3><br>
In Fables old, less ancient yet then <mark4>these,</mark4><br>
Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha to <mark4>restore</mark4><br>
The Race of Mankind drownd, before the <mark4>Shrine</mark4><br>
Of Themis stood devout. To Heav'n thir <mark4>prayers</mark4><br>
Flew up, nor missd the way, by envious <mark4>windes</mark4><br>
Blown vagabond or frustrate: in they <mark5>passd</mark5><br>
Dimentionless through Heav'nly dores; then <mark4>clad</mark4><br>
With incense, where the Golden Altar fum'd, <br>
By thir great Intercessor, came in <mark4>sight</mark4><br>
Before the Fathers Throne: Them the glad <mark4>Son</mark4><br>
Presenting, thus to intercede <mark4>began.</mark4><br>
<br>
See Father, what first fruits on Earth are <mark4>sprung</mark4><br>
From thy implanted Grace in Man, these <mark4>Sighs</mark4><br>
And Prayers, which in this Golden Censer, <mark1>mixt</mark1><br>
With Incense, I thy Priest before thee <mark4>bring,</mark4><br>
Fruits of more pleasing savour from thy <mark4>seed</mark4><br>
Sow'n with contrition in his heart, then <mark4>those</mark4><br>
Which his own hand manuring all the <mark4>Trees</mark4><br>
Of Paradise could have <mark4>produc't</mark4>, ere <mark4>fall'n</mark4><br>
From innocence. Now therefore bend thine eare <br>
To supplication, heare his sighs though <mark4>mute;</mark4><br>
Unskilful with what words to pray, Iet <mark1>mee</mark1><br>
Interpret for him, mee his <mark4>Advocate</mark4><br>
And propitiation, all his works on <mark1>mee</mark1><br>
Good or not good ingraft, my Merit <mark1>those</mark1><br>
Shall perfet, and for these my Death shall <mark3>pay.</mark3><br>
Accept me, and in mee from these <mark5>receave</mark5><br>
The smell of peace toward Mankinde, let him <mark4>live</mark4><br>
Before thee reconcil'd, at least his <mark4>days</mark4><br>
Numberd, though sad, till Death, his doom (which <mark3>I</mark3><br>
To mitigate thus plead, not to <mark4>reverse)</mark4><br>
To better life shall yeeld him, where with <mark1>mee</mark1><br>
All my redeemd may dwell in joy and <mark4>bliss,</mark4><br>
Made one with me as I with thee am <mark4>one.</mark4><br>
<br>
To whom the Father, without Cloud, <mark4>serene.</mark4><br>
All thy request for <mark4>Man</mark4>, accepted <mark1>Son,</mark1><br>
Obtain, all thy request was my <mark3>Decree:</mark3><br>
But longer in that Paradise to <mark4>dwell,</mark4><br>
The Law I gave to Nature him <mark4>forbids:</mark4><br>
Those pure immortal Elements that <mark3>know</mark3><br>
No gross, no unharmoneous mixture <mark5>foule,</mark5><br>
Eject him tainted now, and purge him <mark4>off</mark4><br>
As a distemper, gross to aire as <mark4>gross,</mark4><br>
And mortal food, as may dispose him <mark4>best</mark4><br>
For dissolution wrought by Sin, that <mark4>first</mark4><br>
Distemperd all things, and of incorrupt <br>
Corrupted. I at first with two fair <mark4>gifts</mark4><br>
Created him endowd, with <mark4>Happiness</mark4><br>
And Immortalitie: that fondly <mark4>lost,</mark4><br>
This other serv'd but to eternize <mark3>woe;</mark3><br>
Till I provided Death; so Death <mark4>becomes</mark4><br>
His final remedie, and after <mark4>Life</mark4><br>
Tri'd in sharp tribulation, and refin'd <br>
By Faith and faithful works, to second <mark1>Life,</mark1><br>
Wak't in the renovation of the <mark4>just,</mark4><br>
Resignes him up with Heav'n and Earth <mark1>renewd.</mark1><br>
But let us call to Synod all the <mark4>Blest</mark4><br>
Through Heav'ns wide bounds; from them I will not <mark4>hide</mark4><br>
My judgments, how with Mankind I <mark4>proceed,</mark4><br>
As how with peccant Angels late they <mark1>saw;</mark1><br>
And in thir state, though firm, stood more <mark5>confirmd.</mark5><br>
<br>
He ended, and the Son gave signal <mark3>high</mark3><br>
To the bright Minister that watchd, hee <mark3>blew</mark3><br>
His Trumpet, heard in Oreb since <mark4>perhaps</mark4><br>
When God descended, and perhaps once <mark3>more</mark3><br>
To sound at general Doom. Th' Angelic <mark4>blast</mark4><br>
Filld all the Regions: from thir blissful <mark5>Bowrs</mark5><br>
Of Amarantin Shade, Fountain or <mark3>Spring,</mark3><br>
By the waters of Life, where ere they <mark4>sate</mark4><br>
In fellowships of joy: the Sons of <mark4>Light</mark4><br>
Hasted, resorting to the Summons <mark1>high,</mark1><br>
And took thir Seats; till from his Throne <mark5>supream</mark5><br>
Th' Almighty thus pronouncd his sovran <mark4>Will.</mark4><br>
<br>
O Sons, like one of us Man is <mark5>become</mark5><br>
To know both Good and Evil, since his <mark4>taste</mark4><br>
Of that defended <mark4>Fruit</mark4>, but let him <mark4>boast</mark4><br>
His knowledge of Good <mark4>lost</mark4>, and Evil <mark4>got,</mark4><br>
Happier, had it suffic'd him to have <mark4>known</mark4><br>
Good by it self, and Evil not at <mark4>all.</mark4><br>
He sorrows now, repents, and prayes <mark4>contrite,</mark4><br>
My motions in him, longer then they <mark4>move,</mark4><br>
His heart I know, how variable and <mark4>vain</mark4><br>
Self-left. Least therefore his now bolder <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
Reach also of the Tree of Life, and <mark4>eat,</mark4><br>
And live for ever, dream at least to <mark1>live</mark1><br>
For ever, to remove him I <mark1>decree,</mark1><br>
And send him from the Garden forth to <mark4>Till</mark4><br>
The Ground whence he was taken, fitter <mark1>soile.</mark1><br>
<br>
Michael, this my behest have thou in <mark4>charge,</mark4><br>
Take to thee from among the Cherubim <br>
Thy choice of flaming Warriours, least the <mark4>Fiend</mark4><br>
Or in behalf of Man, or to <mark4>invade</mark4><br>
Vacant possession som new trouble <mark4>raise:</mark4><br>
Hast thee, and from the Paradise of <mark4>God</mark4><br>
Without remorse drive out the sinful <mark1>Pair,</mark1><br>
From hallowd ground th' unholie, and <mark4>denounce</mark4><br>
To them and to thir Progenie from <mark4>thence</mark4><br>
Perpetual <mark4>banishment</mark4>, Yet least they <mark4>faint</mark4><br>
At the sad Sentence rigorously urg'd, <br>
For I behold them softn'd and with <mark4>tears</mark4><br>
Bewailing thir excess, all terror <mark1>hide.</mark1><br>
If patiently thy bidding they <mark3>obey,</mark3><br>
Dismiss them not disconsolate; <mark5>reveale</mark5><br>
To Adam what shall come in future <mark5>dayes,</mark5><br>
As I shall thee enlighten, <mark4>intermix</mark4><br>
My Cov'nant in the womans seed <mark1>renewd;</mark1><br>
So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in <mark4>peace:</mark4><br>
And on the East side of the Garden <mark4>place,</mark4><br>
Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbes, <br>
Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the <mark4>flame</mark4><br>
Wide waving, all approach farr off to <mark4>fright,</mark4><br>
And guard all passage to the Tree of <mark1>Life:</mark1><br>
Least Paradise a receptacle <mark4>prove</mark4><br>
To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir <mark3>prey,</mark3><br>
With whose stol'n Fruit Man once more to <mark4>delude.</mark4><br>
<br>
He ceas'd; and th' Archangelic Power <mark5>prepar'd</mark5><br>
For swift <mark4>descent</mark4>, with him the Cohort <mark3>bright</mark3><br>
Of watchful Cherubim; four faces <mark4>each</mark4><br>
Had, like a double Janus, all thir <mark4>shape</mark4><br>
Spangl'd with eyes more numerous then <mark1>those</mark1><br>
Of Argus, and more wakeful then to <mark5>drouze,</mark5><br>
Charm'd with Arcadian Pipe, the Pastoral <mark4>Reed</mark4><br>
Of Hermes, or his opiate Rod. Mean <mark4>while</mark4><br>
To resalute the World with sacred <mark1>Light</mark1><br>
Leucothea wak'd, and with fresh dews <mark5>imbalmd</mark5><br>
The Earth, when Adam and first Matron <mark4>Eve</mark4><br>
Had ended now thir Orisons, and <mark4>found</mark4><br>
Strength added from above, new hope to <mark1>spring</mark1><br>
Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt; <br>
Which thus to Eve his welcome words <mark1>renewd.</mark1><br>
<br>
Eve, easily may Faith admit, that <mark1>all</mark1><br>
The good which we enjoy, from Heav'n <mark4>descends;</mark4><br>
But that from us ought should ascend to <mark1>Heav'n</mark1><br>
So prevalent as to concerne the <mark4>mind</mark4><br>
Of God high-blest, or to incline his <mark1>will,</mark1><br>
Hard to belief may seem; yet this will <mark1>Prayer,</mark1><br>
Or one short sigh of humane breath, <mark4>up-borne</mark4><br>
Ev'n to the Seat of God. For since I saught <br>
By Prayer th' offended Deitie to <mark4>appease,</mark4><br>
Kneel'd and before him humbl'd all my <mark4>heart,</mark4><br>
Methought I saw him placable and <mark4>mild,</mark4><br>
Bending his eare; perswasion in me <mark3>grew</mark3><br>
That I was heard with favour; peace <mark5>returnd</mark5><br>
Home to my Brest, and to my <mark1>memorie</mark1><br>
His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our <mark3>Foe;</mark3><br>
Which then not minded in dismay, yet <mark3>now</mark3><br>
Assures me that the bitterness of <mark4>death</mark4><br>
Is past, and we shall live. Whence Haile to <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
Eve rightly call'd, Mother of all <mark4>Mankind,</mark4><br>
Mother of all things living, since by <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
Man is to live, and all things live for <mark4>Man.</mark4><br>
<br>
To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour <mark5>meek.</mark5><br>
Ill worthie I such title should <mark4>belong</mark4><br>
To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind <br>
A help, became thy snare; to mee <mark4>reproach</mark4><br>
Rather belongs, distrust and all <mark5>dispraise:</mark5><br>
But infinite in pardon was my <mark4>Judge,</mark4><br>
That I who first brought Death on all, am <mark5>grac't</mark5><br>
The sourse of life; next favourable <mark3>thou,</mark3><br>
Who highly thus to entitle me <mark5>voutsaf'st,</mark5><br>
Farr other name deserving. But the <mark4>Field</mark4><br>
To labour calls us now with sweat <mark5>impos'd,</mark5><br>
Though after sleepless Night; for see the <mark4>Morn,</mark4><br>
All unconcern'd with our unrest, <mark4>begins</mark4><br>
Her rosie progress smiling; let us <mark4>forth,</mark4><br>
I never from thy side henceforth to <mark3>stray,</mark3><br>
Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind <br>
Laborious, till day droop; while here we <mark1>dwell,</mark1><br>
What can be toilsom in these pleasant <mark5>Walkes?</mark5><br>
Here let us live, though in fall'n <mark4>state</mark4>, <mark4>content.</mark4><br>
<br>
So spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd Eve, but <mark4>Fate</mark4><br>
Subscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, <mark5>imprest</mark5><br>
On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd <br>
After short blush of Morn; nigh in her <mark1>sight</mark1><br>
The Bird of Jove, stoopt from his aerie <mark4>tour,</mark4><br>
Two Birds of gayest plume before him <mark4>drove:</mark4><br>
Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in <mark4>Woods,</mark4><br>
First hunter then, pursu'd a gentle <mark3>brace,</mark3><br>
Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and <mark4>Hinde;</mark4><br>
Direct to th' Eastern Gate was bent thir <mark1>flight.</mark1><br>
Adam observ'd, and with his Eye the <mark3>chase</mark3><br>
Pursuing, not unmov'd to Eve thus <mark4>spake.</mark4><br>
<br>
O Eve, some furder change awaits us <mark3>nigh,</mark3><br>
Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews <br>
Forerunners of his purpose, or to <mark3>warn</mark3><br>
Us haply too secure of our <mark4>discharge</mark4><br>
From penaltie, because from death <mark5>releast</mark5><br>
Some days; how long, and what till then our <mark1>life,</mark1><br>
Who knows, or more then this, that we are <mark4>dust,</mark4><br>
And thither must return and be no <mark1>more.</mark1><br>
Why else this double object in our <mark4>fight</mark4><br>
Of flight pursu'd in th' Air and ore the <mark4>ground</mark4><br>
One way the self-same hour? why in the <mark4>East</mark4><br>
Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning <mark1>light</mark1><br>
More orient in yon Western Cloud that <mark4>draws</mark4><br>
O're the blew Firmament a radiant <mark3>white,</mark3><br>
And slow descends, with somthing heav'nly <mark4>fraught.</mark4><br>
<br>
He err'd not, for by this the heav'nly <mark4>Bands</mark4><br>
Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted <mark1>now</mark1><br>
In Paradise, and on a Hill made <mark4>alt,</mark4><br>
A glorious Apparition, had not <mark4>doubt</mark4><br>
And carnal fear that day dimm'd Adams <mark3>eye.</mark3><br>
Not that more glorious, when the Angels <mark4>met</mark4><br>
Jacob in Mahanaim, where he <mark1>saw</mark1><br>
The field Pavilion'd with his Guardians <mark1>bright;</mark1><br>
Nor that which on the flaming Mount <mark5>appeerd</mark5><br>
In Dothan, cover'd with a Camp of <mark4>Fire,</mark4><br>
Against the Syrian King, who to <mark5>surprize</mark5><br>
One man, Assassin-like had levied <mark4>Warr,</mark4><br>
Warr unproclam'd. The Princely Hierarch <br>
In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise <br>
Possession of the <mark4>Garden</mark4>, hee <mark4>alone,</mark4><br>
To find where Adam shelterd, took his <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
Not unperceav'd of Adam, who to <mark1>Eve,</mark1><br>
While the great Visitant approachd, thus <mark1>spake.</mark1><br>
<br>
Eve, now expect great tidings, which <mark1>perhaps</mark1><br>
Of us will soon determin, or <mark4>impose</mark4><br>
New Laws to be observ'd; for I <mark5>descrie</mark5><br>
From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the <mark4>Hill</mark4><br>
One of the heav'nly <mark4>Host</mark4>, and by his <mark4>Gate</mark4><br>
None of the <mark4>meanest</mark4>, some great <mark4>Potentate</mark4><br>
Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie <br>
Invests him coming; yet not <mark4>terrible,</mark4><br>
That I should fear, nor sociably <mark1>mild,</mark1><br>
As Raphael, that I should much <mark4>confide,</mark4><br>
But solemn and sublime, whom not to <mark4>offend,</mark4><br>
With reverence I must meet, and thou <mark4>retire.</mark4><br>
He ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew <mark1>nigh,</mark1><br>
Not in his shape Celestial, but as <mark1>Man</mark1><br>
Clad to meet Man; over his lucid <mark4>Armes</mark4><br>
A militarie Vest of purple <mark5>flowd</mark5><br>
Livelier then Meliboean, or the <mark5>graine</mark5><br>
Of Sarra, worn by Kings and Hero's <mark4>old</mark4><br>
In time of Truce; lris had dipt the wooff; <br>
His starrie Helme unbuckl'd shew'd him <mark4>prime</mark4><br>
In Manhood where Youth <mark4>ended</mark4>, by his <mark4>side</mark4><br>
As in a glistering Zodiac hung the <mark4>Sword,</mark4><br>
Satans dire dread, and in his hand the <mark4>Spear.</mark4><br>
Adam bowd low, hee Kingly from his <mark4>State</mark4><br>
Inclin'd not, but his coming thus <mark5>declar'd.</mark5><br>
<br>
Adam, Heav'ns high behest no Preface <mark4>needs:</mark4><br>
Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and <mark1>Death,</mark1><br>
Then due by sentence when thou didst <mark4>transgress,</mark4><br>
Defeated of his seisure many <mark1>dayes</mark1><br>
Giv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st <mark4>repent,</mark4><br>
And one bad act with many deeds well <mark4>done</mark4><br>
Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord <mark5>appeas'd</mark5><br>
Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious <mark5>claime;</mark5><br>
But longer in this Paradise to <mark1>dwell</mark1><br>
Permits not; to remove thee I am <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
And send thee from the Garden forth to <mark1>till</mark1><br>
The ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter <mark1>Soile.</mark1><br>
<br>
He added not, for Adam at the <mark5>newes</mark5><br>
Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow <mark1>stood,</mark1><br>
That all his senses bound; Eve, who <mark4>unseen</mark4><br>
Yet all had heard, with audible <mark3>lament</mark3><br>
Discover'd soon the place of her <mark1>retire.</mark1><br>
<br>
O unexpected stroke, worse then of <mark1>Death!</mark1><br>
Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus <mark3>leave</mark3><br>
Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and <mark4>Shades,</mark4><br>
Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to <mark4>spend,</mark4><br>
Quiet though sad, the respit of that <mark3>day</mark3><br>
That must be mortal to us both. O <mark4>flours,</mark4><br>
That never will in other Climate <mark3>grow,</mark3><br>
My early visitation, and my <mark4>last</mark4><br>
At Eev'n, which I bred up with tender <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
From the first op'ning bud, and gave ye <mark4>Names,</mark4><br>
Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or <mark4>ranke</mark4><br>
Your Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount? <br>
Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee <mark5>adornd</mark5><br>
With what to sight or smell was sweet; from <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
How shall I part, and whither wander <mark4>down</mark4><br>
Into a lower World, to this <mark4>obscure</mark4><br>
And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire <br>
Less pure, accustomd to immortal <mark4>Fruits?</mark4><br>
<br>
Whom thus the Angel interrupted <mark5>milde.</mark5><br>
Lament not Eve, but patiently <mark5>resigne</mark5><br>
What justly thou hast <mark4>lost</mark4>, nor set thy <mark1>heart,</mark1><br>
Thus over-fond, on that which is not <mark4>thine;</mark4><br>
Thy going is not lonely, with thee <mark4>goes</mark4><br>
Thy <mark4>Husband</mark4>, him to follow thou art <mark4>bound;</mark4><br>
Where he abides, think there thy native <mark1>soile.</mark1><br>
<br>
Adam by this from the cold sudden <mark4>damp</mark4><br>
Recovering, and his scatterd spirits <mark1>returnd,</mark1><br>
To Michael thus his humble words addressd. <br>
<br>
Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or <mark4>nam'd</mark4><br>
Of them the Highest, for such of shape may <mark4>seem</mark4><br>
Prince above Princes, gently hast thou <mark5>tould</mark5><br>
Thy message, which might else in telling <mark3>wound,</mark3><br>
And in performing end us; what <mark4>besides</mark4><br>
Of sorrow and dejection and <mark4>despair</mark4><br>
Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings <mark1>bring,</mark1><br>
Departure from this happy place, our <mark4>sweet</mark4><br>
Recess, and onely consolation <mark4>left</mark4><br>
Familiar to our eyes, all places <mark4>else</mark4><br>
Inhospitable appeer and <mark4>desolate,</mark4><br>
Nor knowing us nor known: and if by <mark1>prayer</mark1><br>
Incessant I could hope to change the <mark1>will</mark1><br>
Of him who all things can, I would not <mark4>cease</mark4><br>
To wearie him with my assiduous <mark4>cries:</mark4><br>
But prayer against his absolute <mark1>Decree</mark1><br>
No more availes then breath against the <mark5>winde,</mark5><br>
Blown stifling back on him that breaths it <mark1>forth:</mark1><br>
Therefore to his great bidding I <mark4>submit.</mark4><br>
This most afflicts me, that departing <mark4>hence,</mark4><br>
As from his face I shall be hid, <mark5>deprivd</mark5><br>
His blessed count'nance; here I could <mark4>frequent,</mark4><br>
With worship, place by place where he <mark5>voutsaf'd</mark5><br>
Presence Divine, and to my Sons <mark4>relate;</mark4><br>
On this Mount he appeerd, under this <mark3>Tree</mark3><br>
Stood visible, among these Pines his <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
I heard, here with him at this Fountain <mark4>talk'd:</mark4><br>
So many grateful Altars I would <mark5>reare</mark5><br>
Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every <mark4>Stone</mark4><br>
Of lustre from the brook, in <mark1>memorie,</mark1><br>
Or monument to Ages, and <mark4>thereon</mark4><br>
Offer sweet smelling Gumms and Fruits and <mark1>Flours:</mark1><br>
In yonder nether World where shall I <mark4>seek</mark4><br>
His bright appearances, or foot-step <mark4>trace?</mark4><br>
For though I fled him angrie, yet <mark4>recall'd</mark4><br>
To life prolongd and promisd Race, I <mark1>now</mark1><br>
Gladly behold though but his utmost <mark4>skirts</mark4><br>
Of glory, and farr off his steps <mark4>adore.</mark4><br>
<br>
To whom thus Michael with regard <mark5>benigne.</mark5><br>
Adam, thou know'st Heav'n his, and all the <mark4>Earth.</mark4><br>
Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence <mark4>fills</mark4><br>
Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that <mark4>lives,</mark4><br>
Fomented by his virtual power and <mark5>warmd:</mark5><br>
All th' Earth he gave thee to possess and <mark4>rule,</mark4><br>
No despicable gift; surmise not <mark4>then</mark4><br>
His presence to these narrow bounds <mark5>confin'd</mark5><br>
Of Paradise or Eden: this had <mark4>been</mark4><br>
Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had <mark5>spred</mark5><br>
All generations, and had hither <mark1>come</mark1><br>
From all the ends of th' Earth, to <mark4>celebrate</mark4><br>
And reverence thee thir great <mark4>Progenitor.</mark4><br>
But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought <mark1>down</mark1><br>
To dwell on eeven ground now with thy <mark4>Sons:</mark4><br>
Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in <mark5>plaine</mark5><br>
God is as here, and will be found <mark4>alike</mark4><br>
Present, and of his presence many a <mark5>signe</mark5><br>
Still following thee, still compassing thee <mark3>round</mark3><br>
With goodness and paternal Love, his <mark4>Face</mark4><br>
Express, and of his steps the track <mark4>Divine.</mark4><br>
Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be <mark1>confirmd</mark1><br>
Ere thou from hence <mark4>depart</mark4>, know I am <mark4>sent</mark4><br>
To shew thee what shall come in future <mark1>dayes</mark1><br>
To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with <mark4>bad</mark4><br>
Expect to hear, supernal Grace <mark4>contending</mark4><br>
With sinfulness of <mark4>Men</mark4>, thereby to <mark4>learn</mark4><br>
True patience, and to temper joy with <mark4>fear</mark4><br>
And pious sorrow, equally enur'd <br>
By moderation either state to <mark3>beare,</mark3><br>
Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou <mark4>lead</mark4><br>
Safest thy life, and best prepar'd <mark4>endure</mark4><br>
Thy mortal passage when it comes. <mark4>Ascend</mark4><br>
This Hill; let Eve (for I have drencht her <mark4>eyes)</mark4><br>
Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st, <br>
As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was <mark5>formd.</mark5><br>
<br>
To whom thus Adam gratefully <mark5>repli'd.</mark5><br>
Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the <mark4>path</mark4><br>
Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n <mark1>submit,</mark1><br>
However chast'ning, to the evil turne <br>
My obvious breast, arming to overcom <br>
By suffering, and earne rest from labour <mark4>won,</mark4><br>
If so I may attain.   So both <mark1>ascend</mark1><br>
In the Visions of God: It was a <mark1>Hill</mark1><br>
Of Paradise the highest, from whose <mark4>top</mark4><br>
The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest <mark4>Ken</mark4><br>
Stretcht out to the amplest reach of prospect <mark3>lay.</mark3><br>
Not higher that Hill nor wider looking <mark1>round,</mark1><br>
Whereon for different cause the Tempter <mark4>set</mark4><br>
Our second Adam in the <mark4>Wilderness,</mark4><br>
To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory. <br>
His Eye might there command wherever <mark1>stood</mark1><br>
City of old or modern Fame, the <mark4>Seat</mark4><br>
Of mightiest Empire, from the destind <mark4>Walls</mark4><br>
Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian <mark4>Can</mark4><br>
And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs <mark4>Throne,</mark4><br>
To Paquin of Sinaean Kings, and <mark1>thence</mark1><br>
To Agra and Lahor of great <mark4>Mogul</mark4><br>
Down to the golden Chersonese, or <mark4>where</mark4><br>
The Persian in Ecbatan sate, or <mark4>since</mark4><br>
In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar <br>
In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance, <br>
<mark4>Turchestan-born</mark4>, nor could his eye not <mark1>ken</mark1><br>
Th' Empire of Negus to his utmost <mark1>Port</mark1><br>
Ercoco and the less Maritim <mark4>Kings</mark4><br>
Mombaza, and Quiloa, and <mark5>Melind,</mark5><br>
And Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realme <br>
Of Congo, and Angola fardest <mark4>South;</mark4><br>
Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas <mark4>Mount</mark4><br>
The Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and <mark4>Sus,</mark4><br>
Marocco and Algiers, and <mark5>Tremisen;</mark5><br>
On Europe thence, and where Rome was to <mark3>sway</mark3><br>
The World: in Spirit perhaps he also <mark1>saw</mark1><br>
Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume, <br>
And Cusco in Peru, the richer <mark1>seat</mark1><br>
Of Atabalipa, and yet <mark5>unspoil'd</mark5><br>
Guiana, whose great Citie Geryons <mark1>Sons</mark1><br>
Call El Dorado: but to nobler <mark4>sights</mark4><br>
Michael from Adams eyes the Filme <mark1>remov'd</mark1><br>
Which that false Fruit that promis'd clearer <mark1>sight</mark1><br>
Had bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and <mark3>Rue</mark3><br>
The visual Nerve, for he had much to <mark3>see;</mark3><br>
And from the Well of Life three drops <mark4>instill'd.</mark4><br>
So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd, <br>
Eevn to the inmost seat of mental <mark1>sight,</mark1><br>
That Adam now enforc't to close his <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
Sunk down and all his Spirits became <mark5>intranst:</mark5><br>
But him the gentle Angel by the <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
Soon <mark4>rais'd</mark4>, and his attention thus <mark1>recall'd.</mark1><br>
<br>
Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first <mark4>behold</mark4><br>
Th' effects which thy original crime hath <mark4>wrought</mark4><br>
In some to spring from thee, who never <mark4>touch'd</mark4><br>
Th' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake <mark5>conspir'd,</mark5><br>
Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin <mark4>derive</mark4><br>
Corruption to bring forth more violent <mark4>deeds.</mark4><br>
<br>
His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a <mark1>field,</mark1><br>
Part arable and tilth, whereon were <mark4>Sheaves</mark4><br>
New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and <mark4>foulds;</mark4><br>
Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark <mark1>stood</mark1><br>
Rustic, of grassie sord; thither <mark1>anon</mark1><br>
A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage <mark3>brought</mark3><br>
First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow <mark4>Sheaf,</mark4><br>
Uncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd <mark4>next</mark4><br>
More meek came with the Firstlings of his <mark4>Flock</mark4><br>
Choicest and best; then sacrificing, <mark4>laid</mark4><br>
The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense <mark4>strew'd,</mark4><br>
On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites <mark4>perform'd.</mark4><br>
His Offring soon propitious Fire from <mark1>Heav'n</mark1><br>
Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame; <br>
The others not, for his was not <mark4>sincere;</mark4><br>
Whereat hee inlie <mark4>rag'd</mark4>, and as they <mark1>talk'd,</mark1><br>
Smote him into the Midriff with a <mark1>stone</mark1><br>
That beat out life; he <mark4>fell</mark4>, and deadly <mark4>pale</mark4><br>
Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd. <br>
Much at that sight was Adam in his <mark1>heart</mark1><br>
Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel <mark5>cri'd.</mark5><br>
<br>
O Teacher, some great mischief hath <mark4>befall'n</mark4><br>
To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd; <br>
Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion <mark3>paid?</mark3><br>
<br>
T' whom Michael thus, hee also mov'd, <mark1>repli'd.</mark1><br>
These two are Brethren, <mark4>Adam</mark4>, and to <mark1>come</mark1><br>
Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath <mark4>slain,</mark4><br>
For envie that his Brothers Offering <mark1>found</mark1><br>
From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie <mark4>Fact</mark4><br>
Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith <mark5>approv'd</mark5><br>
Loose no reward, though here thou see him <mark3>die,</mark3><br>
Rowling in dust and gore.   To which our <mark4>Sire.</mark4><br>
<br>
Alas, both for the deed and for the <mark4>cause!</mark4><br>
But have I now seen Death? Is this the <mark1>way</mark1><br>
I must return to native dust? O <mark1>sight</mark1><br>
Of terrour, foul and ugly to <mark1>behold,</mark1><br>
Horrid to think, how horrible to <mark4>feel!</mark4><br>
<br>
To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast <mark4>seen</mark4><br>
In his first shape on man; but many <mark4>shapes</mark4><br>
Of Death, and many are the wayes that <mark1>lead</mark1><br>
To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to <mark4>sense</mark4><br>
More terrible at th' entrance then <mark4>within.</mark4><br>
Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall <mark1>die,</mark1><br>
By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance <mark1>more</mark1><br>
In Meats and Drinks which on the Earth shall <mark1>bring</mark1><br>
Diseases dire, of which a monstrous <mark3>crew</mark3><br>
Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst <mark1>know</mark1><br>
What miserie th' inabstinence of <mark1>Eve</mark1><br>
Shall bring on men.   Immediately a <mark1>place</mark1><br>
Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, <mark4>dark,</mark4><br>
A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were <mark1>laid</mark1><br>
Numbers of all diseas'd, all <mark4>maladies</mark4><br>
Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes <br>
Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous <mark4>kinds,</mark4><br>
Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce <mark5>Catarrhs,</mark5><br>
Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic <mark4>pangs,</mark4><br>
Daemoniac Phrenzie, moaping <mark5>Melancholie</mark5><br>
And Moon-struck madness, pining Atrophie, <br>
Marasmus, and wide-wasting <mark4>Pestilence,</mark4><br>
Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums. <br>
Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, <mark1>despair</mark1><br>
Tended the sick busiest from Couch to <mark4>Couch;</mark4><br>
And over them triumphant Death his <mark4>Dart</mark4><br>
Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft <mark5>invok't</mark5><br>
With vows, as thir chief good, and final <mark4>hope.</mark4><br>
Sight so deform what heart of Rock could <mark4>long</mark4><br>
Drie-ey'd behold? Adam could <mark4>not</mark4>, but <mark4>wept,</mark4><br>
Though not of Woman born; compassion <mark4>quell'd</mark4><br>
His best of Man, and gave him up to <mark1>tears</mark1><br>
A <mark4>space</mark4>, till firmer thoughts restraind <mark4>excess,</mark4><br>
And scarce recovering words his plaint <mark4>renew'd.</mark4><br>
<br>
O miserable Mankind, to what <mark4>fall</mark4><br>
Degraded, to what wretched state <mark5>reserv'd!</mark5><br>
Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv'n <br>
To be thus wrested from us? rather <mark3>why</mark3><br>
Obtruded on us thus? who if we <mark3>knew</mark3><br>
What we receive, would either not <mark3>accept</mark3><br>
Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it <mark1>down,</mark1><br>
Glad to be so dismist in <mark4>peace</mark4>, Can <mark4>thus</mark4><br>
Th' Image of God in man created <mark4>once</mark4><br>
So goodly and erect, though faultie <mark1>since,</mark1><br>
To such unsightly sufferings be debas't <br>
Under inhuman pains? Why should not <mark1>Man,</mark1><br>
Retaining still Divine similitude <br>
In part, from such deformities be <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
And for his Makers Image sake <mark4>exempt?</mark4><br>
<br>
Thir Makers Image,   answerd Michael, <mark1>then</mark1><br>
Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd <br>
To serve ungovern'd appetite, and <mark4>took</mark4><br>
His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish <mark4>vice,</mark4><br>
Inductive mainly to the sin of <mark1>Eve.</mark1><br>
Therefore so abject is thir <mark4>punishment,</mark4><br>
Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir <mark4>own,</mark4><br>
Or if his likeness, by themselves <mark5>defac't</mark5><br>
While they pervert pure Natures healthful <mark4>rules</mark4><br>
To loathsom sickness, worthily, since <mark3>they</mark3><br>
Gods Image did not reverence in <mark4>themselves.</mark4><br>
<br>
I yield it just,   said Adam,   and <mark1>submit.</mark1><br>
But is there yet no other way, <mark1>besides</mark1><br>
These painful passages, how we may <mark1>come</mark1><br>
To Death, and mix with our connatural <mark1>dust;</mark1><br>
<br>
There is,   said Michael,   if thou well <mark4>observe</mark4><br>
The rule of not too much, by temperance <mark4>taught</mark4><br>
In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from <mark1>thence</mark1><br>
Due <mark4>nourishment</mark4>, not gluttonous <mark4>delight,</mark4><br>
Till many years over thy head <mark4>return:</mark4><br>
So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou <mark4>drop</mark4><br>
Into thy Mothers lap, or be with <mark4>ease</mark4><br>
Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death <mark4>mature:</mark4><br>
This is old age; but then thou must <mark4>outlive</mark4><br>
Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will <mark4>change</mark4><br>
To witherd weak and gray; thy Senses <mark1>then</mark1><br>
Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must <mark5>forgoe,</mark5><br>
To what thou hast, and for the Aire of <mark4>youth</mark4><br>
Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne <br>
A Melancholy damp of cold and <mark3>dry</mark3><br>
To weigh thy Spirits down, and last <mark4>consume</mark4><br>
The Balme of Life.   To whom our <mark4>Ancestor.</mark4><br>
<br>
Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would <mark3>prolong</mark3><br>
Life much, bent rather how I may be <mark4>quit</mark4><br>
Fairest and easiest of this combrous <mark1>charge,</mark1><br>
Which I must keep till my appointed <mark1>day</mark1><br>
Of rendring up, and patiently <mark4>attend</mark4><br>
My dissolution.   Michael <mark1>repli'd.</mark1><br>
<br>
Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou <mark5>livst</mark5><br>
Live well, how long or short permit to <mark1>Heav'n:</mark1><br>
And now prepare thee for another <mark1>sight.</mark1><br>
<br>
He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, <mark5>whereon</mark5><br>
Were Tents of various hue; by some were <mark4>herds</mark4><br>
Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the <mark4>sound</mark4><br>
Of Instruments that made melodious <mark4>chime</mark4><br>
Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who <mark1>moovd</mark1><br>
Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant <mark4>touch</mark4><br>
Instinct through all proportions low and <mark1>high</mark1><br>
Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue. <br>
In other part stood one who at the <mark4>Forge</mark4><br>
Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass Had melted (whether found where casual <mark1>fire</mark1><br>
Had wasted woods on Mountain or in <mark4>Vale,</mark4><br>
Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding <mark4>hot</mark4><br>
To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by <mark4>stream</mark4><br>
From underground) the liquid Ore he <mark5>dreind</mark5><br>
Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he <mark1>formd</mark1><br>
First his own Tooles; then, what might else be <mark1>wrought</mark1><br>
Fusil or grav'n in mettle. After <mark1>these,</mark1><br>
But on the hether side a different <mark4>sort</mark4><br>
From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir <mark1>Seat,</mark1><br>
Down to the Plain descended: by thir <mark4>guise</mark4><br>
Just men they seemd, and all thir study <mark4>bent</mark4><br>
To worship God aright, and know his <mark4>works</mark4><br>
Not hid, nor those things last which might <mark4>preserve</mark4><br>
Freedom and Peace to men: they on the <mark4>Plain</mark4><br>
Long had not walkt, when from the Tents <mark1>behold</mark1><br>
A Beavie of fair Women, richly <mark3>gay</mark3><br>
In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they <mark4>sung</mark4><br>
Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came <mark4>on:</mark4><br>
The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
Rove without rein, till in the amorous <mark4>Net</mark4><br>
Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking <mark4>chose;</mark4><br>
And now of love they treat till th' Eevning <mark4>Star</mark4><br>
Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in <mark4>heat</mark4><br>
They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid <mark4>invoke</mark4><br>
Hymen, then first to marriage Rites <mark1>invok't;</mark1><br>
With Feast and Musick all the Tents <mark4>resound.</mark4><br>
Such happy interview and fair <mark4>event</mark4><br>
Of love and youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, <mark1>Flours,</mark1><br>
And charming Symphonies attach'd the <mark1>heart</mark1><br>
Of Adam, soon enclin'd to admit <mark1>delight,</mark1><br>
The bent of Nature; which he thus <mark4>express'd.</mark4><br>
<br>
True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel <mark1>blest,</mark1><br>
Much better seems this Vision, and more <mark1>hope</mark1><br>
Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two <mark4>past;</mark4><br>
Those were of hate and death, or pain much <mark4>worse,</mark4><br>
Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her <mark4>ends.</mark4><br>
<br>
To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is <mark1>best</mark1><br>
By pleasure, though to Nature seeming <mark4>meet,</mark4><br>
Created, as thou art, to nobler <mark4>end</mark4><br>
Holie and pure, conformitie <mark1>divine.</mark1><br>
Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the <mark4>Tents</mark4><br>
Of <mark4>wickedness</mark4>, wherein shall dwell his <mark4>Race</mark4><br>
Who slew his Brother; studious they <mark5>appere</mark5><br>
Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers <mark4>rare,</mark4><br>
Unmindful of thir Maker, though his <mark4>Spirit</mark4><br>
Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd <mark4>none.</mark4><br>
Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall <mark4>beget;</mark4><br>
For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that <mark5>seemd</mark5><br>
Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so <mark1>gay,</mark1><br>
Yet empty of all good wherein <mark4>consists</mark4><br>
Womans domestic honour and chief <mark4>praise;</mark4><br>
Bred onely and completed to the <mark1>taste</mark1><br>
Of lustful appetence, to sing, to <mark4>dance,</mark4><br>
To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the <mark1>Eye.</mark1><br>
To these that sober Race of Men, whose <mark1>lives</mark1><br>
Religious titl'd them the Sons of <mark1>God,</mark1><br>
Shall yield up all thir vertue, all thir <mark4>fame</mark4><br>
Ignobly, to the traines and to the <mark4>smiles</mark4><br>
Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in <mark3>joy,</mark3><br>
(Erelong to swim at large) and laugh; for <mark4>which</mark4><br>
The world erelong a world of tears must weepe. <br>
<br>
To whom thus Adam of short joy <mark4>bereft.</mark4><br>
O pittie and shame, that they who to live <mark4>well</mark4><br>
Enterd so faire, should turn aside to <mark4>tread</mark4><br>
Paths <mark4>indirect</mark4>, or in the mid way <mark1>faint!</mark1><br>
But still I see the tenor of Mans <mark1>woe</mark1><br>
Holds on the same, from Woman to <mark4>begin.</mark4><br>
<br>
From Mans effeminate slackness it <mark1>begins,</mark1><br>
Said th' Angel, who should better hold his <mark1>place</mark1><br>
By wisdome, and superiour gifts <mark5>receav'd.</mark5><br>
But now prepare thee for another <mark4>Scene.</mark4><br>
<br>
He lookd and saw wide Territorie <mark1>spred</mark1><br>
Before him, Towns, and rural works <mark3>between,</mark3><br>
Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs, <br>
Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning <mark1>Warr,</mark1><br>
Giants of mightie Bone, and bould <mark4>emprise;</mark4><br>
Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming <mark4>Steed,</mark4><br>
Single or in Array of Battel <mark4>rang'd</mark4><br>
Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring <mark1>stood;</mark1><br>
One way a Band select from forage <mark4>drives</mark4><br>
A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire <mark5>Kine</mark5><br>
From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy <mark1>Flock,</mark1><br>
Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the <mark1>Plaine,</mark1><br>
Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds <mark3>flye,</mark3><br>
But call in aide, which makes a bloody <mark3>Fray;</mark3><br>
With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine; <br>
Where Cattle pastur'd late, now scatterd <mark4>lies</mark4><br>
With Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind <mark1>Field</mark1><br>
Deserted: Others to a Citie <mark4>strong</mark4><br>
Lay Seige, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and <mark4>Mine,</mark4><br>
Assaulting; others from the wall <mark4>defend</mark4><br>
With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous <mark1>Fire;</mark1><br>
On each hand slaughter and gigantic <mark1>deeds.</mark1><br>
In other part the scepter'd Haralds <mark4>call</mark4><br>
To Council in the Citie Gates: <mark1>anon</mark1><br>
Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours <mark1>mixt,</mark1><br>
Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but <mark4>soon</mark4><br>
In factious opposition, till at <mark1>last</mark1><br>
Of middle Age one rising, <mark4>eminent</mark4><br>
In wise deport, spake much of Right and <mark3>Wrong,</mark3><br>
Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and <mark1>Peace,</mark1><br>
And Judgment from above: him old and <mark4>young</mark4><br>
Exploded and had seiz'd with violent <mark4>hands,</mark4><br>
Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him <mark1>thence</mark1><br>
Unseen amid the throng: so <mark4>violence</mark4><br>
Proceeded, and Oppression, and <mark3>Sword-Law</mark3><br>
Through all the Plain, and refuge none was <mark1>found.</mark1><br>
Adam was all in tears, and to his <mark4>guide</mark4><br>
Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are <mark1>these,</mark1><br>
Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal <mark1>Death</mark1><br>
Inhumanly to men, and multiply <br>
Ten thousandfould the sin of him who <mark3>slew</mark3><br>
His Brother; for of whom such massacher <br>
Make they but of thir <mark4>Brethren</mark4>, men of <mark4>men?</mark4><br>
But who was that Just Man, whom had not <mark1>Heav'n</mark1><br>
Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin <mark1>lost?</mark1><br>
<br>
To whom thus Michael. These are the <mark4>product</mark4><br>
Of those ill mated Marriages thou <mark4>saw'st;</mark4><br>
Where good with bad were matcht, who of <mark1>themselves</mark1><br>
Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence <mark1>mixt,</mark1><br>
Produce prodigious Births of bodie or <mark1>mind.</mark1><br>
Such were these Giants, men of high <mark4>renown;</mark4><br>
For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd, <br>
And Valour and Heroic Vertu <mark4>call'd;</mark4><br>
To overcome in Battle, and <mark3>subdue</mark3><br>
Nations, and bring home spoils with <mark4>infinite</mark4><br>
Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest <mark3>pitch</mark3><br>
Of human Glorie, and for Glorie <mark1>done</mark1><br>
Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours, <br>
Patrons of Mankind, <mark1>Gods</mark1>, and Sons of <mark4>Gods,</mark4><br>
Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of <mark1>men.</mark1><br>
Thus Fame shall be atchiev'd, renown on <mark1>Earth,</mark1><br>
And what most merits fame in silence <mark4>hid.</mark4><br>
But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou <mark5>beheldst</mark5><br>
The onely righteous in a World <mark4>perverse,</mark4><br>
And therefore hated, therefore so <mark4>beset</mark4><br>
With Foes for daring single to be <mark1>just,</mark1><br>
And utter odious Truth, that God would <mark1>come</mark1><br>
To judge them with his Saints: Him the most <mark1>High</mark1><br>
Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged <mark4>Steeds</mark4><br>
Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with <mark1>God</mark1><br>
High in Salvation and the Climes of <mark1>bliss,</mark1><br>
Exempt from Death; to shew thee what <mark4>reward</mark4><br>
Awaits the good, the rest what <mark1>punishment;</mark1><br>
Which now direct thine eyes and soon <mark1>behold.</mark1><br>
<br>
He <mark4>look'd</mark4>, and saw the face of things quite <mark4>chang'd,</mark4><br>
The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to <mark4>roar,</mark4><br>
All now was turn'd to jollitie and <mark4>game,</mark4><br>
To luxurie and riot, feast and <mark1>dance,</mark1><br>
Marrying or prostituting, as <mark4>befell,</mark4><br>
Rape or Adulterie, where passing <mark4>faire</mark4><br>
Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles. <br>
At length a Reverend Sire among them <mark3>came,</mark3><br>
And of thir doings great dislike <mark1>declar'd,</mark1><br>
And testifi'd against thir wayes; hee <mark4>oft</mark4><br>
Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso <mark1>met,</mark1><br>
Triumphs or Festivals, and to them <mark5>preachd</mark5><br>
Conversion and Repentance, as to <mark4>Souls</mark4><br>
In Prison under Judgements <mark4>imminent:</mark4><br>
But all in vain: which when he saw, he <mark5>ceas'd</mark5><br>
Contending, and remov'd his Tents farr <mark1>off;</mark1><br>
Then from the Mountain hewing Timber <mark4>tall,</mark4><br>
Began to build a Vessel of huge <mark4>bulk,</mark4><br>
Measur'd by Cubit, length, and breadth, and <mark5>highth,</mark5><br>
Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a <mark4>dore</mark4><br>
Contriv'd, and of provisions laid in <mark4>large</mark4><br>
For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder <mark4>strange!</mark4><br>
Of every Beast, and Bird, and Insect <mark3>small</mark3><br>
Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as <mark1>taught</mark1><br>
Thir order: last the Sire, and his three <mark1>Sons</mark1><br>
With thir four Wives; and God made fast the <mark1>dore.</mark1><br>
Meanwhile the Southwind <mark4>rose</mark4>, and with black <mark4>wings</mark4><br>
Wide hovering, all the Clouds together <mark1>drove</mark1><br>
From under Heav'n; the Hills to their <mark5>supplie</mark5><br>
Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and <mark4>moist,</mark4><br>
Sent up amain; and now the thick'nd Skie <br>
Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush'd the <mark4>Rain</mark4><br>
Impetuous, and continu'd till the <mark1>Earth</mark1><br>
No more was seen; the floating Vessel <mark4>swum</mark4><br>
Uplifted; and secure with beaked <mark3>prow</mark3><br>
Rode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings <mark1>else</mark1><br>
Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir <mark4>pomp</mark4><br>
Deep under water rould; Sea cover'd <mark3>Sea,</mark3><br>
Sea without shoar; and in thir <mark4>Palaces</mark4><br>
Where luxurie late reign'd, Sea-monsters <mark5>whelp'd</mark5><br>
And stabl'd; of Mankind, so numerous <mark4>late,</mark4><br>
All left, in one small bottom swum <mark5>imbark't.</mark5><br>
How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to <mark1>behold</mark1><br>
The end of all thy Ofspring, end so <mark4>sad,</mark4><br>
Depopulation; thee another <mark5>Floud,</mark5><br>
Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also <mark4>drown'd,</mark4><br>
And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently <mark5>reard</mark5><br>
By th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at <mark1>last,</mark1><br>
Though comfortless, as when a Father <mark4>mourns</mark4><br>
His Children, all in view destroyd at <mark1>once;</mark1><br>
And scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy <mark5>plaint.</mark5><br>
<br>
O Visions ill foreseen! better had <mark1>I</mark1><br>
Liv'd ignorant of future, so had <mark4>borne</mark4><br>
My part of evil onely, each dayes <mark4>lot</mark4><br>
Anough to beare; those now, that were <mark5>dispenst</mark5><br>
The burd'n of many Ages, on me <mark1>light</mark1><br>
At once, by my foreknowledge gaining <mark3>Birth</mark3><br>
Abortive, to torment me ere thir <mark4>being,</mark4><br>
With thought that they must be. Let no man <mark1>seek</mark1><br>
Henceforth to be foretold what shall <mark3>befall</mark3><br>
Him or his Childern, evil he may be <mark4>sure,</mark4><br>
Which neither his foreknowing can <mark4>prevent,</mark4><br>
And hee the future evil shall no <mark1>less</mark1><br>
In apprehension then in substance <mark1>feel</mark1><br>
Grievous to bear: but that care now is <mark1>past,</mark1><br>
Man is not whom to warne: those few escap't <br>
Famin and anguish will at last <mark1>consume</mark1><br>
Wandring that watrie Desert: I had <mark1>hope</mark1><br>
When violence was ceas't, and Warr on <mark1>Earth,</mark1><br>
All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd <br>
With length of happy dayes the race of <mark1>man;</mark1><br>
But I was farr deceav'd; for now I <mark1>see</mark1><br>
Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to <mark4>waste.</mark4><br>
How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial <mark1>Guide,</mark1><br>
And whether here the Race of man will <mark1>end.</mark1><br>
To whom thus Michael. Those whom last thou <mark5>sawst</mark5><br>
In Triumph and luxurious wealth, are <mark1>they</mark1><br>
First seen in acts of prowess <mark1>eminent</mark1><br>
And great exploits, but of true vertu <mark4>void;</mark4><br>
Who having spilt much blood, and don much <mark1>waste</mark1><br>
Subduing Nations, and achievd <mark3>thereby</mark3><br>
Fame in the World, high titles, and rich <mark1>prey,</mark1><br>
Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and <mark4>sloth,</mark4><br>
Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and <mark4>pride</mark4><br>
Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in <mark1>Peace.</mark1><br>
The conquerd also, and enslav'd by <mark1>Warr</mark1><br>
Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu <mark4>loose</mark4><br>
And fear of God, from whom thir pietie <mark4>feign'd</mark4><br>
In sharp contest of Battel found no <mark4>aide</mark4><br>
Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale <br>
Thenceforth shall practice how to live <mark4>secure,</mark4><br>
Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir <mark4>Lords</mark4><br>
Shall leave them to enjoy; for th' Earth shall <mark4>bear</mark4><br>
More then anough, that temperance may be <mark4>tri'd:</mark4><br>
So all shall turn degenerate, all <mark5>deprav'd,</mark5><br>
Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith <mark4>forgot;</mark4><br>
One Man <mark4>except</mark4>, the onely Son of <mark1>light</mark1><br>
In a dark Age, against example <mark4>good,</mark4><br>
Against allurement, custom, and a <mark4>World</mark4><br>
Offended; fearless of reproach and <mark4>scorn,</mark4><br>
Or violence, hee of thir wicked <mark5>wayes</mark5><br>
Shall them admonish, and before them <mark1>set</mark1><br>
The paths of righteousness, how much more <mark4>safe,</mark4><br>
And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to <mark1>come</mark1><br>
On thir impenitence; and shall <mark5>returne</mark5><br>
Of them derided, but of God <mark5>observd</mark5><br>
The one just Man alive; by his <mark4>command</mark4><br>
Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou <mark1>beheldst,</mark1><br>
To save himself and household from <mark4>amidst</mark4><br>
A World devote to universal <mark4>rack.</mark4><br>
No sooner hee with them of Man and <mark4>Beast</mark4><br>
Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg'd, <br>
And shelterd round, but all the <mark4>Cataracts</mark4><br>
Of Heav'n set open on the Earth shall powre <br>
Raine day and night, all fountains of the <mark4>Deep</mark4><br>
Broke <mark4>up</mark4>, shall heave the Ocean to <mark4>usurp</mark4><br>
Beyond all <mark4>bounds</mark4>, till inundation <mark3>rise</mark3><br>
Above the highest Hills: then shall this <mark1>Mount</mark1><br>
Of Paradise by might of Waves be <mark1>moovd</mark1><br>
Out of his place, pushd by the horned <mark1>floud,</mark1><br>
With all his verdure spoil'd, and Trees <mark4>adrift</mark4><br>
Down the great River to the op'ning <mark4>Gulf,</mark4><br>
And there take root an Iland salt and <mark2>bare,</mark2><br>
The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews <mark4>clang.</mark4><br>
To teach thee that God attributes to <mark1>place</mark1><br>
No sanctitie, if none be thither <mark1>brought</mark1><br>
By Men who there frequent, or therein <mark1>dwell.</mark1><br>
And now what further shall ensue, <mark1>behold.</mark1><br>
<br>
He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the <mark1>floud,</mark1><br>
Which now <mark4>abated</mark4>, for the Clouds were <mark4>fled,</mark4><br>
Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing <mark5>drie</mark5><br>
Wrinkl'd the face of Deluge, as <mark5>decai'd;</mark5><br>
And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie <mark4>Glass</mark4><br>
Gaz'd hot, and of the fresh Wave largely <mark3>drew,</mark3><br>
As after thirst, which made thir flowing <mark4>shrink</mark4><br>
From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that <mark4>stole</mark4><br>
With soft foot towards the deep, who now had <mark5>stopt</mark5><br>
His Sluces, as the Heav'n his windows <mark4>shut.</mark4><br>
The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on <mark1>ground</mark1><br>
Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt. <br>
And now the tops of Hills as Rocks <mark5>appeer;</mark5><br>
With clamor thence the rapid Currents <mark4>drive</mark4><br>
Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde. <br>
Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven <mark3>flies,</mark3><br>
And after him, the surer <mark4>messenger,</mark4><br>
A Dove sent forth once and agen to <mark3>spie</mark3><br>
Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may <mark1>light;</mark1><br>
The second time returning, in his <mark4>Bill</mark4><br>
An Olive leafe he brings, pacific <mark1>signe:</mark1><br>
Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke <br>
The ancient Sire descends with all his <mark4>Train;</mark4><br>
Then with uplifted hands, and eyes <mark4>devout,</mark4><br>
Grateful to Heav'n, over his head <mark5>beholds</mark5><br>
A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a <mark3>Bow</mark3><br>
Conspicuous with three listed colours <mark1>gay,</mark1><br>
Betok'ning peace from God, and Cov'nant <mark3>new.</mark3><br>
Whereat the heart of Adam erst so <mark1>sad</mark1><br>
Greatly rejoyc'd, and thus his joy broke <mark1>forth.</mark1><br>
<br>
O thou who future things canst <mark4>represent</mark4><br>
As present, Heav'nly instructer, I <mark3>revive</mark3><br>
At this last sight, assur'd that Man shall <mark1>live</mark1><br>
With all the Creatures, and thir seed <mark1>preserve.</mark1><br>
Farr less I now lament for one whole <mark1>World</mark1><br>
Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce <br>
For one Man found so perfet and so <mark1>just,</mark1><br>
That God voutsafes to raise another <mark1>World</mark1><br>
From him, and all his anger to <mark4>forget.</mark4><br>
But say, what mean those colourd streaks in <mark5>Heavn,</mark5><br>
Distended as the Brow of God <mark1>appeas'd,</mark1><br>
Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde <br>
The fluid skirts of that same watrie <mark4>Cloud,</mark4><br>
Least it again dissolve and showr the <mark1>Earth?</mark1><br>
<br>
To whom th' Archangel. Dextrously thou <mark4>aim'st;</mark4><br>
So willingly doth God remit his <mark4>Ire,</mark4><br>
Though late repenting him of Man <mark1>deprav'd,</mark1><br>
Griev'd at his heart, when looking down he <mark1>saw</mark1><br>
The whole Earth fill'd with violence, and all <mark1>flesh</mark1><br>
Corrupting each thir way; yet those <mark5>remoov'd,</mark5><br>
Such grace shall one just Man find in his <mark1>sight,</mark1><br>
That he relents, not to blot out <mark1>mankind,</mark1><br>
And makes a Covenant never to <mark3>destroy</mark3><br>
The Earth again by flood, nor let the <mark1>Sea</mark1><br>
Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the <mark1>World</mark1><br>
With Man therein or Beast; but when he <mark4>brings</mark4><br>
Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein <mark1>set</mark1><br>
His triple-colour'd Bow, whereon to <mark4>look</mark4><br>
And call to mind his Cov'nant: Day and <mark4>Night,</mark4><br>
Seed time and <mark4>Harvest</mark4>, Heat and hoary <mark4>Frost</mark4><br>
Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things <mark1>new,</mark1><br>
Both Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall <mark1>dwell.</mark1><br>
