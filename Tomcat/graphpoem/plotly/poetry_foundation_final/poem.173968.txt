Title : Meditation under Stars <br>
Author : George Meredith <br><br>

What links are ours with orbs that <mark3>are</mark3><br>
So resolutely <mark3>far:</mark3><br>
The solitary asks, and <mark3>they</mark3><br>
Give radiance as from a <mark5>shield:</mark5><br>
Still at the death of <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
         The seen, the unrevealed.<br>
Implacable they <mark5>shine</mark5><br>
To us who would of Life <mark4>obtain</mark4><br>
An answer for the life we <mark3>strain</mark3><br>
To nourish with one <mark4>sign.</mark4><br>
Nor can imagination <mark3>throw</mark3><br>
The penetrative shaft: we <mark3>pass</mark3><br>
The breath of thought, who would <mark3>divine</mark3><br>
If haply they may <mark3>grow</mark3><br>
As Earth; have our desire to <mark3>know;</mark3><br>
If life comes there to grain from <mark3>grass,</mark3><br>
And flowers like ours of toil and <mark4>pain;</mark4><br>
Has passion to beat <mark3>bar,</mark3><br>
Win space from cleaving <mark3>brain;</mark3><br>
The mystic link <mark3>attain,</mark3><br>
Whereby star holds on <mark3>star.</mark3><br>
<br>
Those visible immortals <mark3>beam</mark3><br>
Allurement to the <mark3>dream:</mark3><br>
Ireful at human hungers <mark3>brook</mark3><br>
No question in the <mark3>look.</mark3><br>
For ever virgin to our <mark4>sense,</mark4><br>
Remote they wane to gaze <mark3>intense:</mark3><br>
Prolong it, and in ruthlessness they smite<br>
The beating heart behind the ball of <mark5>sight:</mark5><br>
Till we conceive their heavens <mark4>hoar,</mark4><br>
         Those lights they raise but sparkles frore,<br>
And Earth, our blood-warm Earth, a shuddering <mark3>prey</mark3><br>
To that frigidity of brainless <mark3>ray.</mark3><br>
Yet space is given for breath of <mark4>thought</mark4><br>
Beyond our bounds when musing: <mark3>more</mark3><br>
When to that musing love is <mark3>brought,</mark3><br>
         And love is asked of love's wherefore.<br>
         'Tis Earth's, her gift; else have we nought:<br>
Her gift, her secret, here our <mark3>tie.</mark3><br>
And not with her and yonder <mark3>sky?</mark3><br>
Bethink you: were it Earth <mark4>alone</mark4><br>
Breeds love, would not her region <mark4>be</mark4><br>
The sole delight and <mark3>throne</mark3><br>
Of generous <mark4>Deity?</mark4><br>
<br>
To deeper than this ball of <mark1>sight</mark1><br>
Appeal the lustrous people of the <mark3>night.</mark3><br>
Fronting yon shoreless, sown with fiery <mark3>sails,</mark3><br>
It is our ravenous that <mark3>quails,</mark3><br>
Flesh by its craven thirsts and fears <mark4>distraught.</mark4><br>
The spirit leaps <mark4>alight,</mark4><br>
Doubts not in them is <mark3>he,</mark3><br>
The binder of his sheaves, the sane, the <mark3>right:</mark3><br>
Of magnitude to magnitude is <mark4>wrought,</mark4><br>
To feel it large of the great life they <mark4>hold:</mark4><br>
In them to come, or vaster <mark5>intervolved,</mark5><br>
The issues known in us, our unsolved <mark4>solved:</mark4><br>
That there with toil Life climbs the self-same <mark3>Tree,</mark3><br>
Whose roots enrichment have from ripeness <mark4>dropped.</mark4><br>
So may we read and little find them <mark4>cold:</mark4><br>
Let it but be the lord of Mind to <mark4>guide</mark4><br>
Our eyes; no branch of Reason's growing <mark3>lopped;</mark3><br>
Nor dreaming on a dream; but <mark4>fortified</mark4><br>
By day to penetrate black midnight; <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
Hear, feel, outside the senses; even that <mark3>we,</mark3><br>
The specks of dust upon a mound of <mark4>mould,</mark4><br>
We who reflect those rays, though low our <mark4>place,</mark4><br>
To them are lastingly <mark4>allied.</mark4><br>
<br>
So may we <mark4>read</mark4>, and little find them <mark1>cold:</mark1><br>
Not frosty lamps illumining dead <mark3>space,</mark3><br>
Not distant <mark4>aliens</mark4>, not senseless <mark4>Powers.</mark4><br>
The fire is in them whereof we are <mark4>born;</mark4><br>
The music of their motion may be <mark3>ours.</mark3><br>
Spirit shall deem them beckoning Earth and <mark4>voiced</mark4><br>
Sisterly to her, in her beams <mark3>rejoiced.</mark3><br>
Of love, the grand impulsion, we <mark3>behold</mark3><br>
The love that lends her <mark3>grace</mark3><br>
Among the starry <mark3>fold.</mark3><br>
Then at new flood of customary <mark3>morn,</mark3><br>
Look at her through her <mark3>showers,</mark3><br>
Her mists, her streaming <mark3>gold,</mark3><br>
A wonder edges the familiar <mark3>face:</mark3><br>
She wears no more that robe of printed <mark3>hours;</mark3><br>
Half strange seems Earth, and sweeter than her <mark3>flowers.</mark3><br>
