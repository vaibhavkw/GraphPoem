Title : Father and Son <br>
Author : Delmore Schwartz <br><br>

"From a certain point onward there is no longer any turning back. That is the point that must be <mark4>reached."</mark4><br>
FRANZ KAFKA<br>
<br>
On these <mark4>occasions</mark4>, the feelings <mark4>surprise,</mark4><br>
Spontaneous as rain, and they <mark3>compel</mark3><br>
Explicitness, embarrassed <mark3>eyes----</mark3><br>
<br>
Father, you're not Polonius, you're <mark4>reticent,</mark4><br>
<br>
But sure. I can already <mark3>tell</mark3><br>
The unction and falsetto of the <mark4>sentiment</mark4><br>
Which gratifies the facile mouth, but <mark4>springs</mark4><br>
From no felt, had, and wholly known <mark3>things.</mark3><br>
You must let me tell you what you <mark4>fear</mark4><br>
<br>
When you wake up from <mark1>sleep</mark1>, still drunk with <mark1>sleep:</mark1><br>
<br>
You are afraid of time and its slow <mark4>drip,</mark4><br>
Like melting ice, like smoke upon the <mark4>air</mark4><br>
In February's glittering sunny <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
Your guilt is nameless, because its name is <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
Because its name is death. But you can <mark4>stop</mark4><br>
Time as it dribbles from you, drop by <mark3>drop.</mark3><br>
But I thought time was full of <mark4>promises,</mark4><br>
Even as now, the emotion of going <mark3>away----</mark3><br>
<br>
That is the first of all its <mark4>menaces,</mark4><br>
<br>
The lure of a future different from <mark3>today;</mark3><br>
All of us always are turning <mark1>away</mark1><br>
<br>
To the cinema and Asia. All of us <mark3>go</mark3><br>
<br>
To one indeterminate <mark4>nothing.</mark4><br>
Must it be <mark3>so?</mark3><br>
I question the sentiment you give to me, <br>
As premature, not to be <mark4>given</mark4>, learned <mark4>alone</mark4><br>
When experience shrinks upon the chilling <mark3>bone.</mark3><br>
<br>
I would be sudden now and rash in <mark3>joy,</mark3><br>
<br>
As if I lived forever, the future my <mark3>toy.</mark3><br>
Time is a dancing fire at <mark4>twenty-one,</mark4><br>
Singing and shouting and drinking to the <mark4>sun,</mark4><br>
Powerful at the wheel of a <mark4>motor-car,</mark4><br>
Not thinking of death which is foreign and <mark4>far.</mark4><br>
If time flowed from your will and were a <mark4>feast</mark4><br>
I would be wrong to question your <mark4>zest.</mark4><br>
But each age betrays the same weak <mark4>shape.</mark4><br>
Each moment is dying. You will try to <mark3>escape</mark3><br>
From melting time and your dissipating <mark4>soul</mark4><br>
<br>
By hiding your head in a warm and dark <mark3>hole.</mark3><br>
<br>
See the evasions which so many <mark4>don,</mark4><br>
To flee the guilt of time they become <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
That <mark3>is</mark3>, the one number among <mark4>masses,</mark4><br>
The one anonymous in the <mark4>audience,</mark4><br>
The one expressionless in the subway, <br>
In the subway evening among so many <mark4>faces,</mark4><br>
The one who reads the daily <mark4>newspaper,</mark4><br>
Separate from actor and act, a <mark4>member</mark4><br>
Of public opinion, never <mark4>involved.</mark4><br>
Integrated in the revery of a fine <mark3>cigar,</mark3><br>
Fleeing to childhood at the symphony <mark4>concert,</mark4><br>
Buying sleep at the <mark4>drugstore</mark4>, <mark4>grandeur</mark4><br>
At the band concert, Hawaii <br>
On the screen, and everywhere a specious <mark4>splendor:</mark4><br>
One, when he is sad, has something to <mark4>eat,</mark4><br>
An ice cream soda, a toasted <mark4>sandwich,</mark4><br>
Or has his teeth <mark4>fixed</mark4>, but can always <mark3>retreat</mark3><br>
From the actual pain, and dream of the <mark4>rich.</mark4><br>
This is what one <mark4>does</mark4>, what one <mark4>becomes</mark4><br>
Because one is afraid to be <mark1>alone,</mark1><br>
Each with his own death in the lonely <mark4>room.</mark4><br>
But there is a stay. You can <mark1>stop</mark1><br>
Time as it dribbles from you, drop by <mark1>drop.</mark1><br>
Now I am afraid. What is there to be <mark3>known?</mark3><br>
Guilt, guilt of time, nameless <mark4>guilt.</mark4><br>
Grasp firmly your fear, thus grasping your self,   <br>
Your actual will. Stand in <mark5>mastery,</mark5><br>
Keeping time in you, its terrifying <mark4>mystery.</mark4><br>
Face yourself, constantly go back <br>
<br>
To what you were, your own <mark3>history.</mark3><br>
<br>
You are always in <mark3>debt</mark3>, Do not <mark4>forget</mark4><br>
<br>
The dream postponed which would not quickly <mark3>get</mark3><br>
<br>
Pleasure immediate as drink, but <mark4>takes</mark4><br>
The travail of building, patience with <mark4>means.</mark4><br>
See the wart on your face and on your friend's <mark4>face,</mark4><br>
On your friend's face and indeed on your own <mark1>face.</mark1><br>
The loveliest woman sweats, the animal <mark4>stains</mark4><br>
The ideal which is with us like the sky <mark3>...</mark3><br>
Because of that, some laugh, and others <mark3>cry.</mark3><br>
Do not look past and turn away your <mark1>face.</mark1><br>
You cannot depart and take another <mark4>name,</mark4><br>
Nor go to sleep with lies. Always the <mark3>same,</mark3><br>
Always the same self from the ashes of <mark1>sleep</mark1><br>
Returns with its memories, <mark1>always</mark1>, <mark4>always,</mark4><br>
The phoenix with eight hundred thousand <mark4>memories!</mark4><br>
What must I do that is most <mark4>difficult?</mark4><br>
<br>
You must meet your death face to <mark1>face,</mark1><br>
<br>
You must, like one in an old <mark3>play,</mark3><br>
<br>
Decide, once for all, your heart's <mark3>place.</mark3><br>
<br>
Love, power, and fame stand on an <mark4>absolute</mark4><br>
Under the formless night and the brilliant <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
The searching violin, the piercing <mark4>flute.</mark4><br>
Absolute! Venus and Caesar fade at that <mark3>edge,</mark3><br>
Hanging from the fiftieth-story <mark3>ledge,</mark3><br>
Or diminished in bed when the nurse <mark4>presses</mark4><br>
<br>
Her sickening unguents and her cold <mark3>compresses.</mark3><br>
<br>
When the news is certain, surpassing <mark1>fear,</mark1><br>
<br>
You touch the wound, the priceless, the most <mark3>dear.</mark3><br>
<br>
There in death's shadow, you <mark4>comprehend</mark4><br>
The irreducible wish, world without <mark3>end.</mark3><br>
I begin to understand the reason for <mark4>evasion,</mark4><br>
I cannot partake of your difficult <mark4>vision.</mark4><br>
Begin to understand the first <mark3>decision.</mark3><br>
Hamlet is the example; only <mark4>dying</mark4><br>
Did he take up his manhood, the dead's <mark4>burden,</mark4><br>
Done with evasion, done with <mark3>sighing,</mark3><br>
Done with revery. <br>
Decide that you are <mark1>dying</mark1><br>
Because time is in you, ineluctable   <br>
As shadow, named by no <mark4>syllable.</mark4><br>
Act in that shadow, as if death were now:   <br>
Your own self acts then, then you <mark3>know.</mark3><br>
<br>
My father has taught me to be <mark4>serious.</mark4><br>
<br>
Be guilty of yourself in the full <mark4>looking-glass.</mark4><br>
