Title : The Portrait <br>
Author : Dante Gabriel Rossetti <br><br>

This is her picture as she <mark4>was:</mark4><br>
It seems a thing to wonder <mark3>on,</mark3><br>
As though mine image in the <mark4>glass</mark4><br>
Should tarry when myself am <mark3>gone.</mark3><br>
I gaze until she seems to <mark3>stir,?</mark3><br>
Until mine eyes almost <mark4>aver</mark4><br>
That now, even now, the sweet lips <mark3>part</mark3><br>
To breathe the words of the sweet <mark3>heart:?</mark3><br>
And yet the earth is over <mark3>her.</mark3><br>
<br>
Alas! even such the thin-drawn <mark3>ray</mark3><br>
That makes the prison-depths more <mark4>rude,?</mark4><br>
The drip of water night and <mark3>day</mark3><br>
Giving a tongue to <mark4>solitude.</mark4><br>
Yet only this, of love's whole <mark4>prize,</mark4><br>
<mark4>Remains</mark4>, save what in mournful <mark3>guise</mark3><br>
Takes counsel with my soul <mark4>alone,?</mark4><br>
Save what is secret and <mark3>unknown,</mark3><br>
Below the earth, above the <mark3>skies.</mark3><br>
<br>
In painting her I shrin'd her <mark4>face</mark4><br>
Mid mystic trees, where light falls <mark4>in</mark4><br>
Hardly at all; a covert <mark3>place</mark3><br>
Where you might think to find a <mark3>din</mark3><br>
Of doubtful talk, and a live <mark3>flame</mark3><br>
Wandering, and many a shape whose <mark3>name</mark3><br>
Not itself knoweth, and old <mark3>dew,</mark3><br>
And your own footsteps meeting <mark3>you,</mark3><br>
And all things going as they <mark3>came.</mark3><br>
<br>
A deep dim wood; and there she <mark4>stands</mark4><br>
As in that wood that day: for <mark3>so</mark3><br>
Was the still movement of her <mark3>hands</mark3><br>
And such the pure line's gracious <mark3>flow.</mark3><br>
And passing fair the type must <mark4>seem,</mark4><br>
Unknown the presence and the <mark3>dream.</mark3><br>
'Tis she: though of herself, <mark4>alas!</mark4><br>
Less than her shadow on the <mark3>grass</mark3><br>
Or than her image in the <mark3>stream.</mark3><br>
<br>
That day we met there, I and <mark3>she</mark3><br>
One with the other all <mark1>alone;</mark1><br>
And we were blithe; yet <mark4>memory</mark4><br>
Saddens those hours, as when the <mark4>moon</mark4><br>
Looks upon daylight. And with <mark1>her</mark1><br>
I stoop'd to drink the <mark4>spring-water,</mark4><br>
Athirst where other waters <mark5>sprang;</mark5><br>
And where the echo is, she <mark3>sang,?</mark3><br>
My soul another echo <mark3>there.</mark3><br>
<br>
But when that hour my soul won <mark5>strength</mark5><br>
For words whose silence wastes and <mark4>kills,</mark4><br>
Dull raindrops smote us, and at <mark3>length</mark3><br>
Thunder'd the heat within the <mark3>hills.</mark3><br>
That eve I spoke those words <mark4>again</mark4><br>
Beside the pelted <mark4>window-pane;</mark4><br>
And there she hearken'd what I <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
With under-glances that <mark4>survey'd</mark4><br>
The empty pastures blind with <mark4>rain.</mark4><br>
<br>
Next day the memories of these <mark4>things,</mark4><br>
Like leaves through which a bird has <mark4>flown,</mark4><br>
Still vibrated with Love's warm <mark3>wings;</mark3><br>
Till I must make them all my <mark3>own</mark3><br>
And paint this picture. So, 'twixt <mark4>ease</mark4><br>
Of talk and sweet long <mark4>silences,</mark4><br>
She stood among the plants in <mark4>bloom</mark4><br>
At windows of a summer <mark3>room,</mark3><br>
To feign the shadow of the <mark4>trees.</mark4><br>
<br>
And as I wrought, while all <mark3>above</mark3><br>
And all around was fragrant <mark3>air,</mark3><br>
In the sick burthen of my <mark3>love</mark3><br>
It seem'd each sun-thrill'd blossom <mark1>there</mark1><br>
Beat like a heart among the <mark4>leaves.</mark4><br>
O heart that never beats nor <mark3>heaves,</mark3><br>
In that one darkness lying <mark5>still,</mark5><br>
What now to thee my love's great <mark3>will</mark3><br>
Or the fine web the sunshine <mark3>weaves?</mark3><br>
<br>
For now doth daylight <mark3>disavow</mark3><br>
Those days,?nought left to see or <mark4>hear.</mark4><br>
Only in solemn whispers <mark3>now</mark3><br>
At night-time these things reach mine <mark3>ear;</mark3><br>
When the leaf-shadows at a <mark4>breath</mark4><br>
Shrink in the road, and all the <mark4>heath,</mark4><br>
Forest and water, far and <mark4>wide,</mark4><br>
In limpid starlight <mark4>glorified,</mark4><br>
Lie like the mystery of <mark4>death.</mark4><br>
<br>
Last night at last I could have <mark4>slept,</mark4><br>
And yet delay'd my sleep till <mark4>dawn,</mark4><br>
Still wandering. Then it was I <mark3>wept:</mark3><br>
For unawares I came <mark4>upon</mark4><br>
Those glades where once she walk'd with <mark3>me:</mark3><br>
And as I stood there <mark4>suddenly,</mark4><br>
All wan with traversing the <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
Upon the desolate verge of <mark3>light</mark3><br>
Yearn'd loud the iron-bosom'd <mark3>sea.</mark3><br>
<br>
Even so, where Heaven holds breath and <mark4>hears</mark4><br>
The beating heart of Love's own <mark4>breast,?</mark4><br>
Where round the secret of all <mark4>spheres</mark4><br>
All angels lay their wings to <mark3>rest,?</mark3><br>
How shall my soul stand rapt and <mark4>aw'd,</mark4><br>
When, by the new birth borne <mark4>abroad</mark4><br>
Throughout the music of the <mark4>suns,</mark4><br>
It enters in her soul at <mark4>once</mark4><br>
And knows the silence there for <mark4>God!</mark4><br>
<br>
Here with her face doth memory <mark4>sit</mark4><br>
Meanwhile, and wait the day's <mark4>decline,</mark4><br>
Till other eyes shall look from <mark3>it,</mark3><br>
Eyes of the spirit's <mark4>Palestine,</mark4><br>
Even than the old gaze tenderer:<br>
While hopes and aims long lost with <mark1>her</mark1><br>
Stand round her image side by <mark4>side,</mark4><br>
Like tombs of pilgrims that have <mark3>died</mark3><br>
About the Holy Sepulchre.<br>
