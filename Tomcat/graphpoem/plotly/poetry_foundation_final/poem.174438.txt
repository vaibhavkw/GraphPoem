Pla ce <mark3>bo,</mark3><br>
Who is there, who? <br>
Di le <mark3>xi,</mark3><br>
Dame <mark4>Margery;</mark4><br>
Fa, re, <mark1>my</mark1>, <mark1>my,</mark1><br>
Wherfore and <mark1>why</mark1>, <mark3>why?</mark3><br>
For the sowle of Philip Sparowe, <br>
That was late slayn at Carowe, <br>
Among the Nones <mark3>Blake,</mark3><br>
For that swete soules <mark3>sake,</mark3><br>
And for all sparowes <mark4>soules,</mark4><br>
Set in our bederolles, <br>
Pater noster <mark3>qui,</mark3><br>
With an Ave <mark4>Mari,</mark4><br>
And with the corner of a Crede, <br>
The more shalbe your mede. <br>
<br>
Whan I remembre <mark5>agayn</mark5><br>
How mi Philyp was <mark5>slayn,</mark5><br>
Never halfe the payne <br>
Was betwene you twayne, <br>
Pyramus and Thesbe, <br>
As than befell to <mark3>me:</mark3><br>
I wept and I wayled, <br>
The tearys downe hayled; <br>
But nothinge it avayled <br>
To call Phylyp <mark5>agayne,</mark5><br>
Whom Gyb our cat hath <mark5>slayne.</mark5><br>
<br>
Gib, I saye, our <mark3>cat,</mark3><br>
Worrowyd her on <mark3>that</mark3><br>
Which I loved <mark4>best:</mark4><br>
It can not be exprest <br>
My sorowfull hevynesse, <br>
But all without redresse; <br>
For within that <mark5>stounde,</mark5><br>
Halfe slumbrynge, in a swounde <br>
I fell downe to the grounde. <br>
<br>
Unneth I kest myne <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
Towarde the cloudy <mark5>skyes:</mark5><br>
But whan I dyd beholde <br>
My sparow dead and colde, <br>
No creatuer but that wolde <br>
Have rewed upon <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
To behold and <mark1>se</mark1><br>
What hevynesse dyd me <mark5>pange;</mark5><br>
Wherewith my handes I wrange, <br>
That my senaws <mark4>cracked,</mark4><br>
As though I had ben <mark3>racked,</mark3><br>
So payned and so strayned, <br>
That no lyfe wellnye remayned. <br>
<br>
I syghed and I <mark3>sobbed,</mark3><br>
For that I was <mark3>robbed</mark3><br>
Of my sparowes <mark1>lyfe.</mark1><br>
O mayden, wydow, and <mark1>wyfe,</mark1><br>
Of what estate ye <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
Of hye or lowe degre, <br>
Great sorowe than ye myght <mark1>se,</mark1><br>
And lerne to wepe at <mark1>me!</mark1><br>
Such paynes dyd me frete, <br>
That myne hert dyd bete, <br>
My vysage pale and <mark4>dead,</mark4><br>
Wanne, and blewe as <mark3>lead;</mark3><br>
The panges of hatefull <mark5>death</mark5><br>
Wellnye had stopped my <mark3>breath.</mark3><br>
Heu, heu, <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
That I am wo for <mark4>the!</mark4><br>
Ad Dominum, cum tribularer, clamavi:  <br>
Of God nothynge els crave <mark3>I</mark3><br>
But Phyllypes soule to kepe <br>
From the marees deepe <br>
Of Acherontes <mark3>well,</mark3><br>
That is a flode of <mark3>hell;</mark3><br>
And from the great <mark4>Pluto,</mark4><br>
The prynce of endles <mark3>wo;</mark3><br>
And from foule Alecto, <br>
With vysage blacke and blo; <br>
And from Medusa, that <mark3>mare,</mark3><br>
That lyke a fende doth <mark3>stare;</mark3><br>
And from Megeras edders, <br>
For rufflynge of Phillips fethers, <br>
And from her fyry sparklynges, <br>
For burnynge of his wynges; <br>
And from the smokes sowre <br>
Of Proserpinas bowre; <br>
And from the dennes <mark4>darke,</mark4><br>
Wher Cerberus doth <mark3>barke,</mark3><br>
Whom Theseus dyd afraye, <br>
Whom Hercules dyd outraye, <br>
As famous poetes <mark2>say;</mark2><br>
From that <mark5>hell-hounde,</mark5><br>
That lyeth in cheynes bounde, <br>
With gastly hedes thre, <br>
To Jupyter pray <mark3>we</mark3><br>
That Phyllyp preserved may <mark1>be!</mark1><br>
Amen, say ye with <mark1>me!</mark1><br>
<br>
Do mi nus,  <br>
Helpe nowe, swete Jesus! <br>
Levavi oculos meos in <mark4>montes:</mark4><br>
Wolde God I had Zenophontes, <br>
Or Socrates the <mark4>wyse</mark4><br>
To shew me their devyse, <br>
Moderatly to <mark4>take</mark4><br>
This sorrow that I <mark3>make</mark3><br>
For Phylyp Sparowes <mark1>sake!</mark1><br>
So fervently I <mark3>shake,</mark3><br>
I fele my body <mark3>quake;</mark3><br>
So urgently I am <mark4>brought</mark4><br>
Into carefull <mark3>thought.</mark3><br>
Like Andromach, Hectors <mark1>wyfe,</mark1><br>
Was wery of her <mark1>lyfe,</mark1><br>
Whan she had lost her joye, <br>
Noble Hector of Troye; <br>
In lyke maner <mark4>also</mark4><br>
Encreaseth my dedly <mark1>wo,</mark1><br>
For my sparowe is <mark3>go.</mark3><br>
<br>
It was so prety a fole, <br>
It wold syt on a <mark4>stole,</mark4><br>
And lerned after my scole <br>
For to kepe his <mark4>cut,</mark4><br>
With, "Phyllyp, kepe your <mark1>cut!"</mark1><br>
<br>
It had a velvet <mark3>cap,</mark3><br>
And wold syt upon my <mark3>lap,</mark3><br>
And seke after small wormes, <br>
And somtyme white bred crommes; <br>
And many tymes and ofte <br>
Betwene my brestes softe <br>
It wolde lye and <mark4>rest;</mark4><br>
It was propre and <mark3>prest.</mark3><br>
<br>
Somtyme he wolde <mark4>gaspe</mark4><br>
Whan he sawe a waspe; <br>
A fly or a <mark4>gnat,</mark4><br>
He wolde flye at <mark1>that;</mark1><br>
And prytely he wold <mark4>pant</mark4><br>
Whan he saw an <mark3>ant;</mark3><br>
Lord, how he wolde <mark3>pry</mark3><br>
After the butterfly! <br>
Lorde, how he wolde <mark4>hop</mark4><br>
After the gressop! <br>
And whan I sayd, "Phyp! Phyp!" <br>
Than he wold lepe and <mark5>skyp,</mark5><br>
And take me by the lyp. <br>
Alas, it wyll me slo, <br>
That Phillyp is gone me <mark3>fro!</mark3><br>
