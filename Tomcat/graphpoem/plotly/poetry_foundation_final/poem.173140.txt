Title : The Ballad of Sally in our Alley <br>
Author : Henry Carey <br><br>

The ARGUMENT.  A Vulgar Error having long prevailed among many Persons, who imagine Sally Salisbury the Subject of this Ballad, the Author begs leave to undeceive and assure them it has not the least allusion to her, he being a stranger to her very Name at the time this Song was composed. For as Innocence and Virtue were ever the Boundaries of his Muse, so in this little Poem he had no other view than to set forth the Beauty of a chaste and disinterested Passion, even in the lowest Class of human Life. The real Occasion was this: A Shoemaker's 'Prentice making Holiday with his Sweet-heart, treated her with a sight of Bedlam, the Puppet-shews, the Flying-chairs, and all the Elegancies of the Moorfields: From whence proceeding to the Farthing Pye-house, he gave her a Collation of Buns, Cheesecakes, Gammon of Bacon, Stuff'd-beef, and Bottled-ale; through all which Scenes the Author dodged them (charm'd with the Simplicity of their Courtship), from whence he drew this little Sketch of Nature; but being then young and obscure, he was very much ridicul'd by some of his Acquaintance for this Performance; which nevertheless made its way into the polite World, and amply recompenced him by the Applause of the divine <mark4>Addison</mark4>, who was pleased (more than once) to mention it with <mark4>Approbation.</mark4><br>
Of all the Girls that are so <mark3>smart</mark3><br>
There's none like pretty <mark3>SALLY,</mark3><br>
She is the Darling of my <mark3>Heart,</mark3><br>
And she lives in our <mark3>Alley.</mark3><br>
There is no Lady in the <mark4>Land</mark4><br>
Is half so sweet as <mark1>SALLY,</mark1><br>
She is the Darling of my <mark1>Heart,</mark1><br>
And she lives in our <mark1>Alley.</mark1><br>
<br>
Her Father he makes Cabbage-nets,<br>
And through the Streets does cry <mark1>'em;</mark1><br>
Her Mother she sells Laces long,<br>
To such as please to buy <mark1>'em:</mark1><br>
But sure such Folks could ne'er <mark4>beget</mark4><br>
So sweet a Girl as <mark1>SALLY!</mark1><br>
She is the Darling of my <mark1>Heart,</mark1><br>
And she lives in our <mark1>Alley.</mark1><br>
<br>
When she is by I leave my <mark3>Work,</mark3><br>
(I love her so <mark4>sincerely)</mark4><br>
My Master comes like any <mark3>Turk,</mark3><br>
And bangs me most <mark3>severely;</mark3><br>
But, let him bang his Belly <mark4>full,</mark4><br>
I'll bear it all for <mark1>SALLY;</mark1><br>
She is the Darling of my <mark1>Heart,</mark1><br>
And she lives in our <mark1>Alley.</mark1><br>
<br>
Of all the Days that's in the <mark4>Week,</mark4><br>
       I dearly love but one Day,<br>
And that's the Day that comes <mark4>betwixt</mark4><br>
A Saturday and <mark4>Monday;</mark4><br>
For then I'm drest, all in my <mark4>best,</mark4><br>
To walk abroad with <mark1>SALLY;</mark1><br>
She is the Darling of my <mark1>Heart,</mark1><br>
And she lives in our <mark1>Alley.</mark1><br>
<br>
My Master carries me to <mark3>Church,</mark3><br>
And often am I <mark4>blamed,</mark4><br>
Because I leave him in the <mark3>lurch,</mark3><br>
As soon as Text is <mark3>named:</mark3><br>
I leave the Church in Sermon <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
And slink away to <mark1>SALLY;</mark1><br>
She is the Darling of my <mark1>Heart,</mark1><br>
And she lives in our <mark1>Alley.</mark1><br>
<br>
When Christmas comes about <mark4>again,</mark4><br>
O then I shall have <mark4>Money;</mark4><br>
I'll hoard it up, and Box and <mark4>all</mark4><br>
I'll give it to my <mark3>Honey:</mark3><br>
And, would it were ten thousand Pounds;<br>
I'd give it all to <mark1>SALLY;</mark1><br>
She is the Darling of my <mark1>Heart,</mark1><br>
And she lives in our <mark1>Alley.</mark1><br>
<br>
My Master and the Neighbours <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
Make game of me and <mark1>SALLY;</mark1><br>
And (but for her) I'd better <mark4>be</mark4><br>
A Slave and row a <mark4>Galley:</mark4><br>
But when my seven long Years are <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
O then I'll marry <mark1>SALLY!</mark1><br>
O then we'll wed and then we'll <mark4>bed,</mark4><br>
But not in our <mark1>Alley.</mark1><br>
