Title : Happy Hour <br>
Author : Alan R. Shapiro <br><br>

The gregarious dark is <mark4>shifting</mark4><br>
when she puts her second <mark4>drink,</mark4><br>
the free one, half on the <mark1>coaster.</mark1><br>
The tipped wine poised at the <mark3>brim</mark3><br>
is the beginning of the bad <mark1>girl</mark1><br>
she'll promise never to be again   <br>
tomorrow, who can taunt him now   <br>
to prove he doesn't love her <br>
and never could: her hand <mark4>slides</mark4><br>
up his thigh until he tenses-- <br>
'My little prig, don't you <mark5>want</mark5><br>
to fuck me?' the bad <mark1>girl</mark1><br>
she couldn't be at home, his wife on <mark4>ice.</mark4><br>
All he can do is smile <mark4>back</mark4><br>
as though she's made a <mark4>harmless</mark4><br>
good-natured joke, and <mark4>struggle</mark4><br>
not to look around to <mark5>see</mark5><br>
who's heard, who's watching. He <mark4>wants</mark4><br>
to smash the wine glass in her <mark4>face</mark4><br>
so he can know for <mark4>once</mark4><br>
exactly what he's done <mark4>wrong;</mark4><br>
but he places it <mark4>instead</mark4><br>
back safely on the <mark1>coaster</mark1><br>
quickly before she <mark4>sees.</mark4><br>
Never cautious enough, he is <mark4>prepared</mark4><br>
even if she knocks it <mark4>over</mark4><br>
to go down on his hands and <mark3>knees</mark3><br>
and wipe it up, kind and <mark4>forgiving.</mark4><br>
In all ways careful to acquit <mark5>himself</mark5><br>
so that tomorrow when she <mark4>says</mark4><br>
she doesn't deserve him, he's too <mark4>good,</mark4><br>
he can believe her. Tomorrow   <br>
will be his happy hour. There won't <mark3>be</mark3><br>
anything she wouldn't do for <mark3>him.</mark3><br>
