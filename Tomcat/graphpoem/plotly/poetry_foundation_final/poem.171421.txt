Title : The Author to His Body on Their Fifteenth Birthday, 29 ii 80 <br>
Author : Howard Nemerov <br><br>

"There's never a dull moment in the human <mark4>body.</mark4>, --The Insight <mark4>Lady</mark4><br>
Dear old equivocal and closest <mark4>friend,</mark4><br>
Grand Vizier to a weak bewildered <mark4>king,</mark4><br>
Now we approach The Ecclesiastean Age <br>
Where the heart is like to go off inside your <mark4>chest</mark4><br>
Like a party favor, or the brain blow a <mark4>fuse</mark4><br>
And the comic-book light-bulb of Idea black <mark4>out</mark4><br>
Forever, the idiot balloon of speech   <br>
Go blank, and we shall know, if it be <mark4>knowing,</mark4><br>
The world as it was before language once <mark4>again;</mark4><br>
<br>
Mighty Fortress, maybe already <mark4>mined</mark4><br>
And readying to blow up <mark4>grievances</mark4><br>
About the lifetime of your <mark4>servitude,</mark4><br>
The body of this death one talkative <mark4>saint</mark4><br>
Wanted to be delivered of (not <mark4>yet!),</mark4><br>
Aggressively asserting your ancient <mark4>right</mark4><br>
To our humiliation by the <mark4>bowel</mark4><br>
Or the rough justice of the elderly <mark4>lecher's</mark4><br>
Retiring from this incontinence to <mark4>that;</mark4><br>
<br>
Dark horse, it's you we've put the money <mark4>on</mark4><br>
Regardless, the parody and satire <mark4>and</mark4><br>
The nevertheless forgiveness of the <mark4>soul</mark4><br>
Or mind, self, spirit, will or whatever else <br>
The ever-unknowable unknown is calling itself <br>
This time around--shall we renew our <mark4>vows?</mark4><br>
How should we know by now how we might do   <br>
Divorced? Homely animal, in sickness and health,   <br>
For the duration; buddy, you know the <mark4>drill.</mark4><br>
