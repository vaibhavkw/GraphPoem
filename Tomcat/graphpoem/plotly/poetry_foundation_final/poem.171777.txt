Title : Philosophia Perennis <br>
Author : Anne Waldman <br><br>

I turned: quivering yellow stars in blackness   <br>
I wept: how speech may save a <mark4>woman</mark4><br>
The picture changes & promises the <mark4>heroine</mark4><br>
That nighttime & meditation are a mirage <br>
<br>
To discuss pro & contra here is <mark4>mute</mark4><br>
Do I not love you, day? <br>
A pure output of teleological intentions <br>
& she babbles, developing a picture-theory of <mark1>language</mark1><br>
<br>
Do I not play the delicate game of <mark1>language?</mark1><br>
yes, & it is antecedent to the affairs of the world:   <br>
The dish, the mop, the stove, the bed, the <mark4>marriage</mark4><br>
& surges forth the world in which I love <br>
<br>
I and I and I and I and I and I, infinitely reversible   <br>
Yet never secure in the long morning texture <br>
A poor existing woman-being, accept her broken <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
& yet the earth <mark1>i</mark1>, divinity, the sky is <mark1>divinity</mark1><br>
The nomads walk & walk. <br>
