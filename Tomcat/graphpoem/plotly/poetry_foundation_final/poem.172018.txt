Title : Chaplinesque <br>
Author : Hart Crane <br><br>

We make our meek <mark4>adjustments,</mark4><br>
Contented with such random <mark4>consolations</mark4><br>
As the wind <mark4>deposits</mark4><br>
In slithered and too ample <mark4>pockets.</mark4><br>
<br>
For we can still love the <mark4>world</mark4>, who <mark4>find</mark4><br>
A famished kitten on the step, and know <br>
Recesses for it from the fury of the <mark4>street,</mark4><br>
Or warm torn elbow coverts. <br>
<br>
We will sidestep, and to the final <mark4>smirk</mark4><br>
Dally the doom of that inevitable thumb <br>
That slowly chafes its puckered index toward <mark4>us,</mark4><br>
Facing the dull squint with what <mark4>innocence</mark4><br>
And what <mark4>surprise!</mark4><br>
<br>
And yet these fine collapses are not <mark3>lies</mark3><br>
More than the pirouettes of any pliant <mark4>cane;</mark4><br>
Our obsequies are, in a way, no <mark4>enterprise.</mark4><br>
We can evade you, and all else but the <mark4>heart:</mark4><br>
What blame to us if the heart live <mark4>on.</mark4><br>
<br>
The game enforces smirks; but we have <mark4>seen</mark4><br>
The moon in lonely alleys <mark4>make</mark4><br>
A grail of laughter of an empty ash <mark4>can,</mark4><br>
And through all sound of gaiety and <mark4>quest</mark4><br>
Have heard a kitten in the <mark4>wilderness.</mark4><br>
