Title : Youth and Age <br>
Author : Samuel Taylor Coleridge <br><br>

Verse, a breeze mid blossoms <mark4>straying,</mark4><br>
Where Hope clung feeding, like a <mark3>bee--</mark3><br>
Both were mine! Life went a-maying<br>
         With Nature, Hope, and Poesy,<br>
When I was <mark4>young!</mark4><br>
<br>
When I was young?--Ah, woful <mark3>When!</mark3><br>
Ah! for the change 'twixt Now and <mark3>Then!</mark3><br>
This breathing house not built with <mark3>hands,</mark3><br>
This body that does me grievous <mark4>wrong,</mark4><br>
O'er aery cliffs and glittering <mark3>sands,</mark3><br>
How lightly then it flashed <mark3>along:--</mark3><br>
Like those trim skiffs, unknown of <mark3>yore,</mark3><br>
On winding lakes and rivers <mark3>wide,</mark3><br>
That ask no aid of sail or <mark3>oar,</mark3><br>
That fear no spite of wind or <mark3>tide!</mark3><br>
Nought cared this body for wind or <mark3>weather</mark3><br>
When Youth and I lived in't <mark3>together.</mark3><br>
<br>
Flowers are lovely; Love is <mark3>flower-like;</mark3><br>
Friendship is a sheltering <mark3>tree;</mark3><br>
O! the joys, that came down <mark3>shower-like,</mark3><br>
Of Friendship, Love, and Liberty,<br>
Ere I was <mark4>old!</mark4><br>
Ere I was old? Ah woful <mark4>Ere,</mark4><br>
Which tells me, Youth's no longer <mark4>here!</mark4><br>
O Youth! for years so many and <mark3>sweet,</mark3><br>
'Tis <mark4>known</mark4>, that Thou and I were <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
I'll think it but a fond <mark3>conceit--</mark3><br>
It cannot be that Thou art <mark4>gone!</mark4><br>
<br>
Thy vesper-bell hath not yet <mark4>toll'd:--</mark4><br>
And thou wert aye a masker <mark3>bold!</mark3><br>
What strange disguise hast now put <mark3>on,</mark3><br>
To make believe, that thou are <mark1>gone?</mark1><br>
I see these locks in silvery <mark3>slips,</mark3><br>
This drooping gait, this altered <mark4>size:</mark4><br>
But Spring-tide blossoms on thy <mark3>lips,</mark3><br>
And tears take sunshine from thine <mark3>eyes!</mark3><br>
Life is but thought: so think I <mark3>will</mark3><br>
That Youth and I are house-mates <mark3>still.</mark3><br>
<br>
Dew-drops are the gems of <mark4>morning,</mark4><br>
But the tears of mournful <mark3>eve!</mark3><br>
Where no hope is, life's a <mark3>warning</mark3><br>
That only serves to make us <mark3>grieve,</mark3><br>
When we are <mark1>old:</mark1><br>
That only serves to make us <mark1>grieve</mark1><br>
With oft and tedious <mark3>taking-leave,</mark3><br>
Like some poor nigh-related <mark4>guest,</mark4><br>
That may not rudely be dismist;<br>
Yet hath outstay'd his welcome <mark4>while,</mark4><br>
And tells the jest without the <mark3>smile.</mark3><br>
