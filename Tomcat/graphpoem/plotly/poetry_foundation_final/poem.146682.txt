Title : Cock <br>
Author : Albert Goldbarth <br><br>

Chile, 1834 <br>
<br>
A month before his dinner with the visiting Spanish <mark4>lawyer,</mark4><br>
he had "set out for the purpose of geologizing," <br>
and rode back over the ridge of the Chilecauquen <br>
with a huge jute bag of living <mark4>shells</mark4><br>
from the sandy flats at the coast, and with <mark4>another,</mark4><br>
as full, of dead barnacles scraped from the <mark3>rock.</mark3><br>
A few months forward from that <mark4>dinner</mark4><br>
--on the island of San Pedro, where the Beagle was <mark4>anchored</mark4><br>
awaiting him--he would be sneaking up on a <mark1>fox</mark1><br>
"of a kind very rare" and donking it <mark4>stoutly</mark4><br>
"on the head with my geological hammer." (The <mark1>fox,</mark1><br>
he'll write, "is now in the Zoological <mark4>Society.")</mark4><br>
So what does he think, when the Spanish lawyer expresses a <mark5>disbelief</mark5><br>
that the King of England would be so loco as to <mark4>bother</mark4><br>
to ship to this sensible, orderly country a <mark4>man</mark4><br>
"to pick up beetles and <mark4>lizards</mark4>, and to break <mark4>stones"?</mark4><br>
No, the whiff of something "off "--like suspect meat--attends <br>
eccentric stunts like these. "I do not like <mark4>it:</mark4><br>
if one of us were to go and do such things in <mark4>England,</mark4><br>
do not you think the King of England would very <mark4>shortly</mark4><br>
command us to leave his shores?" Renous, <br>
another student of bugs and rocks, from <mark4>Germany,</mark4><br>
is also there at dinner, and he mentions <mark4>then</mark4><br>
that once, in a house in San Fernando, he'd been <mark4>discovered</mark4><br>
contemplating the transformation of caterpillars to <mark4>butterflies.</mark4><br>
He couldn't deny it: there they <mark3>were,</mark3><br>
the writhing green proof, in an open <mark3>box!</mark3><br>
"The Padres and the Governor <mark4>consulted</mark4>, and <mark4>agreed</mark4><br>
it must be some heresy"--and so Renous was <mark4>arrested.</mark4><br>
Darwin can only shake his head in a quiet <mark4>bemusement</mark4><br>
as his guests converse. Those inchling <mark4>creatures</mark4><br>
crawling over their chopped-up foliage, heads as <mark4>blunt</mark4><br>
as thimbled thumbs . . . heretical? <mark3>How</mark3><br>
could anybody believe that the innocent <mark4>jumble</mark4><br>
in the baskets and flasks of a naturalist is <mark4>dangerous?</mark4><br>
<br>
And Lillian Colton--the woman in Owatonna, <br>
<br>
Minnesota who for forty years has avidly <mark4>collected</mark4><br>
the seeds of that state and, with them ("poking <mark5>them</mark5><br>
into place with toothpicks and gluing them <mark4>down"),</mark4><br>
has portraitured "American <mark4>presidents,</mark4><br>
movie stars, country <mark4>musicians</mark4>, rock and roll <mark4>legends,</mark4><br>
scientific and religious leaders (including Mother <mark5>Teresa)"</mark5><br>
--what suspiciousness might seize the Spanish <mark1>lawyer</mark1><br>
if he saw her on her rounds? What edgy <mark4>wariness</mark4><br>
would grip him if he chanced on Nellie <mark4>Staves,</mark4><br>
"at 87 perhaps the most famous Adirondack <mark4>trapper,"</mark4><br>
out in the summer to harvest shell-shaped <mark4>fungus</mark4><br>
off the dead trees of those shaded, spinous <mark4>hills?</mark4><br>
--she'll work for twenty hours straight on <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
with the point of an old school compass, stippling <mark1>it</mark1><br>
into the scene of a great alert-eyed <mark4>ram</mark4><br>
or a sunrise, watching as the fungus's own <mark4>interior,</mark4><br>
brown juices dye the image into <mark4>permanence.</mark4><br>
Who would these represent, for the Spanish lawyer, <mark4>what</mark4><br>
forbidden Other?--a girl in the corner, walling her <mark4>attention</mark4><br>
away from her sisters' strident hip-hop, by <mark4>reading</mark4><br>
a fanciful tale of witches? a girl on a dancer <mark4>pole</mark4><br>
at Sturgis, strobing her tits for the boys in a quick 1-2-1 <br>
semaphore of fuck-the-work-week revelry? <mark4>Surely</mark4><br>
not. Surely these are no threat to his world. And <mark4>yet</mark4><br>
for nothing more than positing a newly <mark4>ordered</mark4><br>
sky map, Giordano Bruno was led in <mark4>chains</mark4><br>
from his cell in the Roman prison of Castel San'Angelo, <mark5>there</mark5><br>
where he'd spent eight years as the Inquisition <mark4>hammered</mark4><br>
at his ideas and his calm resolve. It was February 19th, <br>
was stuffed in his mouth, to prevent any <mark4>final</mark4><br>
<br>
utterance of blasphemy; and he was burned <mark4>alive.</mark4><br>
The leg skin bubbled off of his body like a Christmas <mark4>pig's.</mark4><br>
It turns out that a redone sky <mark4>implies</mark4><br>
a redone God--and a God is intolerant of <mark4>this,</mark4><br>
a God is jealous of any counter claim to the <mark4>pedigree</mark4><br>
of His cosmos. Yes, but . . . surely <mark4>not</mark4><br>
this mushroom picker? not this boy who simply <mark4>speaks</mark4><br>
to invisible friends as he wanders around the <mark4>alleys?</mark4><br>
Oh but that would depend on the given Spanish <mark1>lawyer</mark1><br>
of that given day and circumstance. In <mark4>Ghent,</mark4><br>
a cock was put on trial and sentenced to <mark4>death</mark4><br>
for repeatedly disturbing the peace of the Lord's <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
Sunday. It had been warned; so <mark3>now</mark3><br>
it was just, to lead this beast to a chopping <mark3>block</mark3><br>
--restoring the sanctified <mark4>order.</mark4><br>
Kansas, 2004 <br>
<br>
Ah, for a witty transition from <mark3>"cock"</mark3><br>
<br>
to my neighbors Suzette and Edie!--lesbians, <mark1>now</mark1><br>
<br>
in love with each other for over a decade and <mark4>wanting</mark4><br>
only to declare their love in a marriage <mark3>vow,</mark3><br>
"like anyone," as Edie says. Not <mark4>that</mark4><br>
my schoolboy humor would find <mark4>favor</mark4><br>
in their reading life . . . although we get <mark4>along;</mark4><br>
some shared affinity enables The <mark4>Church</mark4><br>
of the Gay Girls and The Orthodox Congregation of Guy <br>
to coexist with an amiability. Still, I've <mark4>witnessed</mark4><br>
other people pass them by with the <mark5>slitted,</mark5><br>
ophidian stare of xenophobia. Suzette and <mark4>Edie</mark4><br>
--are they the new apostasy? are they our <mark4>own</mark4><br>
Anne Hutchinson? In 1638 she was found <mark4>guilty,</mark4><br>
after a two-day trial, of heresy--of being "a <mark4>woman</mark4><br>
not fitt for our Society." With will, she had <mark4>embraced</mark4><br>
doctrinal misinterpretations, "some of them blasphemus, <mark4>others</mark4><br>
erroneus and all Unsafe, and of the Devill of <mark4>Hell,"</mark4><br>
and she was excommunicated from Massachusetts Bay <mark4>Colony</mark4><br>
"evermore." Her actual crime?--a <mark4>claim</mark4><br>
"the Holy Spirit illumines the heart of every true <mark4>believer"</mark4><br>
without the need of a minister <mark4>intervening.</mark4><br>
For this, she was harried into the <mark4>wilds</mark4><br>
--it was called a "hiving-out"--and set at the mercy of <mark4>wolf</mark4><br>
and of winter, "and it were Death to return." Her <mark4>other</mark4><br>
actual crime?--that after a pregnancy, she had been <mark4>delivered</mark4><br>
"of thirtie monstrus Births or therabowts at <mark4>once,</mark4><br>
some of them Bigger, some Lessr, some of one <mark4>shape,</mark4><br>
some of An other, few of any Perfect shape, None at all of <mark1>them</mark1><br>
of Human shape"--which perhaps is what you'd <mark4>expect</mark4><br>
from a woman of "nimble Witt and active Spirit and verie <br>
Voluble Tonggue." At the Republican <mark4>convention,</mark4><br>
it was, indeed, the voluble tongue that Edie always <mark4>flapped</mark4><br>
so saucily (and too, I'd guess, her <mark5>rainbow-hue</mark5><br>
WE'RE ALREADY BEDDED . . . WHY NOT WEDDED? <mark4>T-shirt)</mark4><br>
that (on her side) led inevitably to the <mark4>violence.</mark4><br>
A surly officer suggested that she move. She pointed <mark4>out</mark4><br>
how she was already in the caged-off <mark3>square</mark3><br>
allowed for free-speech protest, and had no <mark4>intention</mark4><br>
of leaving. There were "gestures they exchanged". . . and <mark1>then</mark1><br>
a stun gun's 50,000 volts were suddenly alive inside <mark3>her,</mark3><br>
just enough to crumple her into helplessness so <mark1>that,</mark1><br>
when the panic began, she was trampled by friends and <mark4>police</mark4><br>
alike. A lung was crushed, and when I <mark4>visited</mark4><br>
three weeks later, her skin was still a <mark4>nightmare</mark4><br>
Turkish rug of bruise. (For a moment, I saw in the <mark4>air</mark4><br>
around her the first disabling gust of snow in the <mark4>woods</mark4><br>
at the border of Massachusetts Bay in 1638.) To be <mark3>fair,</mark3><br>
I should add that the confrontational officer doing crowd <mark4>control</mark4><br>
went home with his head little <mark4>more</mark4><br>
than a pocket of blood and neural damage. Do <mark1>not,</mark1><br>
I warn you, ever lightly cross a Wiccan <mark4>bowler.</mark4><br>
Terms I haven't yet used, from my pile of <mark4>notes:</mark4><br>
separatist, sedition, dogma. Finally, though, when those <mark4>clouds</mark4><br>
<br>
of abstraction open up, it's always one <mark4>specific</mark4><br>
<br>
ordinary rainy day, in Chicago, in 1961. I'm <mark4>thirteen,</mark4><br>
squeaky-voiced, and with an adam's apple <mark4>popping</mark4><br>
from my thin throat like a doorknob--while my father is large, <br>
he fought the neighbor's crazy German <mark4>shepherd</mark4><br>
to a standstill once, and behind him are generations of <mark4>him,</mark4><br>
solemn and knowing. We're standing <mark1>there</mark1><br>
in front of the house, in a dim autumnal <mark4>downpour,</mark4><br>
and it wouldn't look to anyone else like an even <mark4>match,</mark4><br>
my scrawny <mark4>shouts</mark4>, his thousands of years of <mark4>righteousness;</mark4><br>
and yet, in emotional terms, I have the upper <mark4>hand.</mark4><br>
I won't believe in his God. I won't <mark4>believe</mark4><br>
in any God, in any synagogue, in any mumbo <mark5>jumbo</mark5><br>
or rabbinical teetotum, and I'm screaming <mark1>this</mark1><br>
and screaming this and screaming this, until I <mark3>see</mark3><br>
the rain become his face, and for the only <mark4>time</mark4><br>
except his mother's funeral on a similar <mark1>day</mark1><br>
of wet and chill in a shivering <mark4>mix,</mark4><br>
my father cries in front of <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
And God, if He's there, must write my name <mark1>down</mark1><br>
on a list that He'll turn over to His deputies on <mark4>Earth</mark4><br>
--His Spanish <mark4>lawyers.</mark4><br>
There are many terms for <mark1>this,</mark1><br>
but only one rain. Now it's falling, grayish <mark4>twill,</mark4><br>
on a hill along the coast of the Chonos Archipelago <mark4>islands.</mark4><br>
asleep: they appeared to be of a loving <mark4>disposition;</mark4><br>
but even pigs would be ashamed of their <mark4>dirt,"</mark4><br>
which is picked at by the <mark4>turkey-buzzards</mark4>, <mark4>Terns,</mark4><br>
<br>
gulls, black-necked swans. A deposit of <mark4>sandstone.</mark4><br>
"Four great snowy cones" of the local <mark4>volcanoes.</mark4><br>
He couldn't be happier. He has computed the number of <mark4>eggs</mark4><br>
in a tenth-of-an-inch of a sea-slug's potent <mark3>slime,</mark3><br>
he has suggested how "a great volume might be <mark4>written,</mark4><br>
describing one of these beds of sea-weed." The <mark4>otter.</mark4><br>
The spunky Chilean mouse. He has <mark4>read</mark4><br>
"a most interesting discussion on the <mark4>history</mark4><br>
of the common potato." He couldn't be more <mark4>mesmerized</mark4><br>
in the grand salons of Paris than here, in the <mark4>rain,</mark4><br>
with his sodden insect net. And <mark3>who</mark3><br>
would complain? He isn't any rooster. He <mark4>isn't</mark4><br>
going to rudely wake anyone from a long sound <mark4>sleep.</mark4><br>
