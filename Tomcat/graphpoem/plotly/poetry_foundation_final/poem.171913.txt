Title : The Air Base at Chateauroux, France <br>
Author : Sherod Santos <br><br>

In the American <mark4>schoolyard</mark4><br>
where we lunged <mark5>headfirst</mark5><br>
onto the rocky ground scrab- <br>
bling for a <mark4>ball</mark4><br>
                         as if <br>
for love, the crossed <mark3>chalk-</mark3><br>
line still electrified <mark1>our</mark1><br>
tough boyish hearts, and no   <br>
one much <mark4>cared</mark4><br>
                      for such <br>
exotic gods as loomed up   <br>
out of the Palatine <mark4>Hills</mark4><br>
in the required <mark4>guidebooks</mark4><br>
dumped in <mark4>heaps</mark4><br>
behind <mark1>our</mark1><br>
makeshift goal. We <mark3>knew</mark3><br>
what we knew. Sweatstains   <br>
darkened our blue <mark4>school</mark4><br>
shirts <mark4>while</mark4><br>
our <mark4>fathers'</mark4><br>
fighters strafed the <mark3>mock-</mark3><br>
ups in the practice <mark4>fields,</mark4><br>
never far enough from town   <br>
it didn't <mark4>thunder</mark4><br>
                           all day <br>
through the <mark4>blackened</mark4><br>
cottages' stony stares <mark4>locked</mark4><br>
up tight behind their <mark4>shot</mark4><br>
bolts; nor <mark3>through</mark3><br>
the <mark4>evening,</mark4><br>
either, when drifting home,   <br>
stripped to the waist, <mark4>we'd</mark4><br>
dance feet-chalked <mark4>across</mark4><br>
the <mark4>marketplace</mark4><br>
like <mark4>young,</mark4><br>
uneasy gods, a little <mark4>drunk</mark4><br>
on our shame, our <mark4>power.</mark4><br>
