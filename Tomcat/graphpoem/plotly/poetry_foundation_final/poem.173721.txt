Title : To John Donne <br>
Author : Ben Jonson <br><br>

Donne, the delight of Phoebus and each <mark3>Muse</mark3><br>
Who, to thy one, all other brains <mark3>refuse;</mark3><br>
Whose every work of thy most early <mark4>wit</mark4><br>
Came forth example, and remains so <mark4>yet;</mark4><br>
Longer a-knowing than most wits do <mark3>live;</mark3><br>
And which no affection praise enough can <mark3>give!</mark3><br>
To it, thy language, letters, arts, best <mark3>life,</mark3><br>
Which might with half mankind maintain a <mark3>strife.</mark3><br>
All which I meant to praise, and yet I <mark3>would;</mark3><br>
But leave, because I cannot as I <mark3>should!</mark3><br>
