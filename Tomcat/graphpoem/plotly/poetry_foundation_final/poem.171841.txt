They are weighing the babies again on color <mark3>television.</mark3><br>
They are hanging these small bags of bones up in canvas <mark4>slings</mark4><br>
to determine which ones will receive the dried-milk <mark4>mush,</mark4><br>
the concentrate made out of ground-up trash <mark4>fish.</mark4><br>
<br>
For years we have watched them, back-lit by the <mark4>desert,</mark4><br>
these miles of dusty hands holding out goatskins or <mark4>cups,</mark4><br>
their animals dead or dying of rinderpest, <br>
and after the credits come up I continue to <mark4>sit</mark4><br>
<br>
through Dinner with Julia, where, in a French <mark1>fish</mark1><br>
poacher big enough for a small brown baby, <mark3>an</mark3><br>
Alaska salmon simmers in a court <mark3>bouillon.</mark3><br>
For a first course, steak tartare to awaken the <mark4>palate.</mark4><br>
<br>
With it Julia suggests a zinfandel. This <mark4>scene</mark4><br>
has a <mark4>polite</mark4>, a touristy flavor to <mark3>it,</mark3><br>
and I let it play. But somewhere Oxfam goes <mark4>on</mark4><br>
spooning gluey gruel between the parched <mark4>lips</mark4><br>
<br>
of potbellied children, the ones who perhaps can be <mark4>saved</mark4><br>
from kwashiorkor--an ancient Ghanaian <mark4>word--</mark4><br>
though with probable lowered IQs, the voiceover <mark4>explains,</mark4><br>
caused by protein deficiencies linked to the <mark4>drought</mark4><br>
<br>
and the drought has grown worse with the gradual increase in <mark4>herds</mark4><br>
overgrazing the thin forage grasses of the Sahel. <br>
This, says the voice, can be laid to the natural <mark4>greed</mark4><br>
of the nomad deceived by technicians digging new <mark4>wells</mark4><br>
<br>
which means (a slow pan of the sand) that the water table has <mark4>dropped.</mark4><br>
And now to Julia's table is borne the resplendent <mark1>fish.</mark1><br>
Always the camera is angled so that the guests look <mark1>up.</mark1><br>
Among them I glimpse that sly Dean, Jonathan <mark4>Swift.</mark4><br>
<br>
After the credits come up I continue to <mark1>sit</mark1><br>
with those who are starving to death in a distant <mark4>nation</mark4><br>
squatting, back-lit by the desert, hands out, in my <mark4>head</mark4><br>
and the Dublin Dean squats there too, observing the <mark3>population</mark3><br>
<br>
that waits for too little dried milk, white rice, trash <mark1>fish.</mark1><br>
Always the camera is angled so they look <mark1>up</mark1><br>
while their babies are weighed in slings on color <mark1>television,</mark1><br>
look into our living rooms and the shaded rooms we sleep <mark4>in.</mark4><br>
