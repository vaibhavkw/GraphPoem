Title : Politics <br>
Author : William Meredith <br><br>

Tonight Hazard's father and stepmother are <mark4>having</mark4><br>
jazz for McGovern. In the old game-room <br>
the old liberals listen as the quintet builds <br>
crazy houses out of skin and brass, <mark4>crumbling</mark4><br>
the house of decorum, everybody likes <mark4>that.</mark4><br>
<br>
For decades they have paid for the <mark4>refurbishing</mark4><br>
of America and they have not got their money's worth. <br>
Now they listen, <mark4>hopeful,</mark4><br>
to the hard rock for <mark4>McGovern.</mark4><br>
<br>
The ceiling in this palace needs <mark4>fixing,</mark4><br>
the chalky blue paint is like an old <mark4>heaven</mark4><br>
but there are holes and <mark4>flaking.</mark4><br>
They had movies here when grandpa was <mark4>solvent.</mark4><br>
<br>
Hazard desires his wife, the way <mark4>people</mark4><br>
on the trains to the death camps were <mark4>seized</mark4><br>
by irrational lust. She is the youngest <mark4>woman</mark4><br>
in the room, he would like to be in <mark4>bed</mark4><br>
with her now, he would like to be <mark4>president.</mark4><br>
<br>
He has not been to his studio<br>
in four days, he asks the bartender,<br>
a college boy with a ponytail, for more <mark4>gin.</mark4><br>
He stands in the doorway. Forsythia and lilac <br>
have overgrown the <mark4>porch</mark4>, there is the <mark4>rich</mark4><br>
smell of wood-rot. What twenty years will do<br>
to untended shrubbery and America and <mark4>Hazard.</mark4><br>
