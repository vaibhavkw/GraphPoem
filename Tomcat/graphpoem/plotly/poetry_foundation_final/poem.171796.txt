Title : A Baroque Wall-Fountain in the Villa Sciarra <br>
Author : Richard Wilbur <br><br>

for Dore and Adja<br>
Under the bronze <mark3>crown</mark3><br>
Too big for the head of the stone cherub whose <mark3>feet</mark3><br>
A serpent has begun to <mark3>eat,</mark3><br>
Sweet water brims a cockle and braids <mark3>down</mark3><br>
<br>
Past spattered mosses, <mark3>breaks</mark3><br>
On the tipped edge of a second shell, and <mark3>fills</mark3><br>
The massive third below. It <mark3>spills</mark3><br>
In threads then from the scalloped rim, and <mark3>makes</mark3><br>
<br>
A scrim or summery <mark4>tent</mark4><br>
For a faun-menage and their familiar <mark4>goose.</mark4><br>
Happy in all that ragged, <mark3>loose</mark3><br>
Collapse of water, its effortless <mark3>descent</mark3><br>
<br>
And flatteries of <mark3>spray,</mark3><br>
The stocky god upholds the shell with <mark4>ease,</mark4><br>
Watching, about his shaggy <mark3>knees,</mark3><br>
The goatish innocence of his babes at <mark3>play;</mark3><br>
<br>
His fauness all the <mark3>while</mark3><br>
Leans forward, slightly, into a clambering <mark3>mesh</mark3><br>
Of water-lights, her sparkling <mark3>flesh</mark3><br>
In a saecular ecstasy, her blinded <mark3>smile</mark3><br>
<br>
Bent on the sand <mark3>floor</mark3><br>
Of the trefoil pool, where ripple-shadows come <br>
      And go in swift reticulum, <br>
More addling to the eye than wine, and <mark3>more</mark3><br>
<br>
Interminable to <mark4>thought</mark4><br>
Than pleasure's calculus. Yet since this <mark4>all</mark4><br>
Is pleasure, flash, and <mark4>waterfall,</mark4><br>
Must it not be too simple? Are we <mark4>not</mark4><br>
<br>
More intricately <mark4>expressed</mark4><br>
In the plain fountains that Maderna <mark4>set</mark4><br>
Before St. Peter's--the main <mark3>jet</mark3><br>
Struggling aloft until it seems at <mark4>rest</mark4><br>
<br>
In the act of rising, <mark4>until</mark4><br>
The very wish of water is <mark4>reversed,</mark4><br>
That heaviness borne up to <mark3>burst</mark3><br>
In a clear, high, cavorting head, to <mark3>fill</mark3><br>
<br>
With <mark4>blaze</mark4>, and then in <mark4>gauze</mark4><br>
Delays, in a gnatlike shimmering, in a <mark4>fine</mark4><br>
Illumined version of itself, <mark3>decline,</mark3><br>
And patter on the stones its own <mark3>applause?</mark3><br>
<br>
If that is what men <mark4>are</mark4><br>
Or should be, if those water-saints <mark3>display</mark3><br>
The pattern of our <mark5>arete,</mark5><br>
What of these showered fauns in their <mark3>bizarre,</mark3><br>
<br>
Spangled, and plunging <mark4>house?</mark4><br>
They are at rest in fulness of <mark3>desire</mark3><br>
For what is given, they do not <mark3>tire</mark3><br>
Of the smart of the sun, the pleasant <mark3>water-douse</mark3><br>
<br>
And riddled pool <mark3>below,</mark3><br>
Reproving our disgust and our ennui   <br>
      With humble insatiety. <br>
Francis, perhaps, who lay in sister <mark3>snow</mark3><br>
<br>
Before the wealthy <mark4>gate</mark4><br>
Freezing and praising, might have seen in <mark4>this</mark4><br>
No trifle, but a shade of <mark3>bliss--</mark3><br>
That land of tolerable flowers, that <mark3>state</mark3><br>
<br>
As near and far as <mark4>grass</mark4><br>
Where eyes become the sunlight, and the <mark3>hand</mark3><br>
Is worthy of water: the dreamt <mark3>land</mark3><br>
Toward which all hungers leap, all pleasures <mark3>pass.</mark3><br>
