Title : Infidelity <br>
Author : Louis Untermeyer <br><br>

You have not conquered me?it is the <mark3>surge</mark3><br>
Of love itself that beats against my <mark3>will;</mark3><br>
It is the sting of conflict, the old <mark3>urge</mark3><br>
That calls me <mark3>still.</mark3><br>
<br>
It is not you I love?it is the <mark3>form</mark3><br>
And shadow of all lovers who have <mark3>died</mark3><br>
That gives you all the freshness of a <mark3>warm</mark3><br>
And unfamiliar <mark3>bride.</mark3><br>
<br>
It is your name I breathe, your hands I <mark3>seek;</mark3><br>
It will be you when you are <mark3>gone.</mark3><br>
And yet the dream, the name I never <mark3>speak,</mark3><br>
Is that that lures me <mark3>on.</mark3><br>
<br>
It is the golden summons, the bright <mark3>wave</mark3><br>
Of banners calling me <mark3>anew;</mark3><br>
It is all beauty, perilous and <mark3>grave?</mark3><br>
It is not <mark3>you.</mark3><br>
