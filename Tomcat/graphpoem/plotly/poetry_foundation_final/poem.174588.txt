Title : Crossing the Bar <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

Sunset and evening <mark3>star,</mark3><br>
And one clear call for <mark3>me!</mark3><br>
And may there be no moaning of the <mark3>bar,</mark3><br>
When I put out to <mark3>sea,</mark3><br>
<br>
But such a tide as moving seems <mark3>asleep,</mark3><br>
Too full for sound and <mark3>foam,</mark3><br>
When that which drew from out the boundless <mark3>deep</mark3><br>
Turns again <mark3>home.</mark3><br>
<br>
Twilight and evening <mark3>bell,</mark3><br>
And after that the <mark3>dark!</mark3><br>
And may there be no sadness of <mark3>farewell,</mark3><br>
When I <mark3>embark;</mark3><br>
<br>
For tho' from out our bourne of Time and <mark3>Place</mark3><br>
The flood may bear me <mark3>far,</mark3><br>
I hope to see my Pilot face to <mark3>face</mark3><br>
When I have crost the <mark1>bar.</mark1><br>
