Title : The Rights of Women <br>
Author : Anna Laetitia Barbauld <br><br>

Yes, injured Woman! rise, assert thy <mark3>right!</mark3><br>
Woman! too long degraded, scorned, opprest;<br>
O born to rule in partial Law's <mark3>despite,</mark3><br>
Resume thy native empire o'er the <mark4>breast!</mark4><br>
<br>
Go forth arrayed in panoply <mark4>divine;</mark4><br>
That angel pureness which admits no <mark4>stain;</mark4><br>
Go, bid proud Man his boasted rule <mark4>resign,</mark4><br>
And kiss the golden sceptre of thy <mark4>reign.</mark4><br>
<br>
Go, gird thyself with grace; collect thy <mark4>store</mark4><br>
Of bright artillery glancing from <mark4>afar;</mark4><br>
Soft melting tones thy thundering cannon's <mark4>roar,</mark4><br>
Blushes and fears thy magazine of <mark3>war.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thy rights are empire: urge no meaner <mark3>claim,--</mark3><br>
Felt, not defined, and if debated, <mark4>lost;</mark4><br>
Like sacred mysteries, which withheld from <mark3>fame,</mark3><br>
Shunning discussion, are revered the <mark4>most.</mark4><br>
<br>
Try all that wit and art suggest to <mark3>bend</mark3><br>
Of thy imperial foe the stubborn <mark3>knee;</mark3><br>
Make treacherous Man thy subject, not thy <mark3>friend;</mark3><br>
Thou mayst command, but never canst be <mark3>free.</mark3><br>
<br>
Awe the licentious, and restrain the <mark4>rude;</mark4><br>
Soften the sullen, clear the cloudy <mark3>brow:</mark3><br>
Be, more than princes' gifts, thy favours <mark3>sued;--</mark3><br>
She hazards all, who will the least <mark3>allow.</mark3><br>
<br>
But hope not, courted idol of <mark4>mankind,</mark4><br>
On this proud eminence secure to <mark5>stay;</mark5><br>
Subduing and <mark4>subdued</mark4>, thou soon shalt <mark3>find</mark3><br>
Thy coldness soften, and thy pride give <mark3>way.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then, then, abandon each ambitious <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
Conquest or rule thy heart shall feebly <mark4>move,</mark4><br>
In Nature's school, by her soft maxims <mark3>taught,</mark3><br>
That separate rights are lost in mutual <mark4>love.</mark4><br>
