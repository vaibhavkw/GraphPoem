Title : Felix Randal <br>
Author : Gerard Manley Hopkins <br><br>

Felix Randal the farrier, O is he dead then? my duty all <mark3>ended,</mark3><br>
Who have watched his mould of man, big-boned and <mark4>hardy-handsome</mark4><br>
Pining, pining, till time when reason rambled in it, and <mark4>some</mark4><br>
Fatal four disorders, fleshed there, all <mark3>contended?</mark3><br>
<br>
Sickness broke him. Impatient, he cursed at first, but <mark3>mended</mark3><br>
Being anointed and all; though a heavenlier heart began <mark1>some</mark1><br>
Months earlier, since I had our sweet reprieve and <mark4>ransom</mark4><br>
Tendered to him. Ah well, God rest him all road ever he <mark3>offended!</mark3><br>
<br>
This seeing the sick endears them to us, us too it <mark5>endears.</mark5><br>
My tongue had taught thee comfort, touch had quenched thy <mark3>tears,</mark3><br>
Thy tears that touched my heart, child, Felix, poor Felix <mark3>Randal;</mark3><br>
<br>
How far from then forethought of, all thy more boisterous <mark3>years,</mark3><br>
When thou at the random grim forge, powerful amidst <mark3>peers,</mark3><br>
Didst fettle for the great grey drayhorse his bright and battering <mark3>sandal!</mark3><br>
