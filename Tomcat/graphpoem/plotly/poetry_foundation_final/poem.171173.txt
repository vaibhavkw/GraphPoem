Title : Playing Dead <br>
Author : Andrew Hudgins <br><br>

Our father liked to play a <mark4>game.</mark4><br>
He played that he was <mark3>dead.</mark3><br>
He took his thick black glasses off    <br>
and stretched out on the <mark3>bed.</mark3><br>
<br>
He wouldn't twitch and didn't <mark4>snore</mark4><br>
or move in any <mark3>way.</mark3><br>
He didn't even seem to breathe!   <br>
We asked, Are you <mark3>okay?</mark3><br>
<br>
We tickled fingers up and down   <br>
his huge, pink, stinky <mark4>feet--</mark4><br>
He didn't move; he lay as <mark4>still</mark4><br>
as last year's <mark4>parakeet.</mark4><br>
<br>
We pushed our fingers up his <mark4>nose,</mark4><br>
and wiggled them <mark4>inside--</mark4><br>
Next, we peeled his eyelids back.   <br>
Are you okay? we <mark3>cried.</mark3><br>
<br>
I really thought he might be <mark1>dead</mark1><br>
and not just playing <mark4>possum,</mark4><br>
because his eyeballs didn't twitch   <br>
when I slid my tongue across <mark3>'em.</mark3><br>
<br>
He's dead, we sobbed--but to be <mark4>sure,</mark4><br>
I jabbed him in the <mark4>jewels.</mark4><br>
He rose, like Jesus, from the <mark1>dead,</mark1><br>
though I don't think Jesus drools.   <br>
<br>
His right hand lashed both right and <mark4>left.</mark4><br>
His left hand clutched his scrotum.   <br>
And the words he yelled--I know damn <mark4>well</mark4><br>
I'm way too young to quote <mark1>'em.</mark1><br>
