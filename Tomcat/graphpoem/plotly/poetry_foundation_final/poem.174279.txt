Title : The House of Life: 66. The Heart of the Night <br>
Author : Dante Gabriel Rossetti <br><br>

From child to youth; from youth to arduous <mark3>man;</mark3><br>
From lethargy to fever of the <mark3>heart;</mark3><br>
From faithful life to dream-dower'd days <mark3>apart;</mark3><br>
From trust to doubt; from doubt to brink of <mark3>ban;?</mark3><br>
Thus much of change in one swift cycle <mark3>ran</mark3><br>
         Till now. Alas, the soul!?how soon must she<br>
         Accept her primal immortality,?<br>
The flesh resume its dust whence it <mark3>began?</mark3><br>
<br>
O Lord of work and peace! O Lord of <mark3>life!</mark3><br>
O Lord, the awful Lord of will! though <mark4>late,</mark4><br>
Even yet renew this soul with duteous <mark3>breath:</mark3><br>
That when the peace is garner'd in from <mark3>strife,</mark3><br>
The work retriev'd, the will <mark4>regenerate,</mark4><br>
This soul may see thy face, O Lord of <mark3>death!</mark3><br>
