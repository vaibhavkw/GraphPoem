Title : Paradise Regain'd: Book 2 (1671 version) <br>
Author : John Milton <br><br>

MEan while the new-baptiz'd, who yet <mark4>remain'd</mark4><br>
At Jordan with the Baptist, and had <mark3>seen</mark3><br>
Him whom they heard so late expresly <mark4>call'd</mark4><br>
Jesus Messiah Son of God <mark5>declar'd,</mark5><br>
And on that high Authority had believ'd, <br>
And with him talkt, and with him lodg'd, I <mark3>mean</mark3><br>
Andrew and <mark4>Simon</mark4>, famous after <mark4>known</mark4><br>
With others though in Holy Writ not <mark4>nam'd,</mark4><br>
Now missing him thir joy so lately <mark4>found,</mark4><br>
So lately found, and so abruptly <mark4>gone,</mark4><br>
Began to doubt, and doubted many <mark4>days,</mark4><br>
And as the days increas'd, increas'd thir <mark4>doubt:</mark4><br>
Sometimes they thought he might be only <mark5>shewn,</mark5><br>
And for a time caught up to God, as <mark4>once</mark4><br>
Moses was in the Mount, and missing <mark1>long;</mark1><br>
And the great Thisbite who on fiery <mark4>wheels</mark4><br>
Rode up to Heaven, yet once again to <mark1>come.</mark1><br>
Therefore as those young Prophets then with <mark4>care</mark4><br>
Sought lost Eliah, so in each place <mark4>these</mark4><br>
Nigh to Bethabara; in Jerico <br>
The City of Palms, AEnon, and Salem <mark4>Old,</mark4><br>
Machaerus and each Town or City <mark4>wall'd</mark4><br>
On this side the broad lake Genezaret, <br>
Or in Perea, but return'd in <mark4>vain.</mark4><br>
Then on the bank of Jordan, by a <mark4>Creek:</mark4><br>
Where winds with Reeds, and Osiers whisp'ring <mark3>play</mark3><br>
Plain Fishermen, no greater men them <mark5>call,</mark5><br>
Close in a Cottage low together <mark4>got</mark4><br>
Thir unexpected loss and plaints out <mark4>breath'd.</mark4><br>
<mark4>Alas</mark4>, from what high hope to what <mark4>relapse</mark4><br>
Unlook'd for are we fall'n, our eyes <mark4>beheld</mark4><br>
Messiah certainly now come, so <mark1>long</mark1><br>
Expected of our Fathers; we have <mark4>heard</mark4><br>
His words, his wisdom full of grace and <mark4>truth,</mark4><br>
Now, now, for sure, deliverance is at <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
The Kingdom shall to Israel be <mark5>restor'd:</mark5><br>
Thus we rejoyc'd, but soon our joy is <mark4>turn'd</mark4><br>
Into perplexity and new <mark4>amaze:</mark4><br>
For whither is he gone, what <mark4>accident</mark4><br>
Hath rapt him from us? will he now <mark4>retire</mark4><br>
After appearance, and again <mark3>prolong</mark3><br>
Our expectation?   God of <mark4>Israel,</mark4><br>
Send thy Messiah forth, the time is <mark1>come;</mark1><br>
Behold the Kings of the Earth how they <mark4>oppress</mark4><br>
Thy chosen, to what highth thir pow'r <mark4>unjust</mark4><br>
They have exalted, and behind them <mark4>cast</mark4><br>
All fear of thee, arise and <mark4>vindicate</mark4><br>
Thy Glory, free thy people from thir <mark4>yoke,</mark4><br>
But let us wait; thus far he hath <mark4>perform'd,</mark4><br>
Sent his Anointed, and to us reveal'd <mark4>him,</mark4><br>
By his great Prophet, pointed at and <mark4>shown,</mark4><br>
In publick, and with him we have <mark5>convers'd;</mark5><br>
Let us be glad of this, and all our <mark4>fears</mark4><br>
Lay on his Providence; he will not <mark4>fail</mark4><br>
Nor will withdraw him now, nor will <mark4>recall,</mark4><br>
Mock us with his blest sight, then snatch him <mark4>hence,</mark4><br>
Soon we shall see our hope, our joy <mark4>return.</mark4><br>
Thus they out of their plaints new hope <mark4>resume</mark4><br>
To find whom at the first they found unsought: <br>
But to his Mother Mary, when she <mark1>saw</mark1><br>
Others return'd from Baptism, not her <mark4>Son,</mark4><br>
Nor left at <mark4>Jordan</mark4>, tydings of him <mark3>none;</mark3><br>
Within her brest, though calm; her brest though <mark4>pure,</mark4><br>
Motherly cares and fears got head, and <mark4>rais'd</mark4><br>
Some troubl'd thoughts, which she in sighs thus <mark4>clad.</mark4><br>
O what avails me now that honour <mark3>high</mark3><br>
To have conceiv'd of God, or that <mark4>salute</mark4><br>
Hale highly favour'd, among women <mark4>blest;</mark4><br>
While I to sorrows am no less <mark5>advanc't,</mark5><br>
And fears as <mark4>eminent</mark4>, above the <mark4>lot</mark4><br>
Of other women, by the birth I <mark4>bore,</mark4><br>
In such a season born when scarce a <mark4>Shed</mark4><br>
Could be obtain'd to shelter him or <mark3>me</mark3><br>
From the bleak air; a Stable was our <mark4>warmth,</mark4><br>
A Manger his, yet soon enforc't to <mark3>flye</mark3><br>
Thence into Egypt, till the Murd'rous <mark4>King</mark4><br>
Were dead, who sought his life, and missing <mark4>fill'd</mark4><br>
With Infant blood the streets of <mark4>Bethlehem;</mark4><br>
From Egypt home return'd, in <mark4>Nazareth</mark4><br>
Hath been our dwelling many years, his <mark4>life</mark4><br>
Private, unactive, calm, <mark5>contemplative,</mark5><br>
Little suspicious to any King; but <mark1>now</mark1><br>
Full grown to Man, acknowledg'd, as I <mark4>hear,</mark4><br>
By John the Baptist, and in publick <mark1>shown,</mark1><br>
Son own'd from Heaven by his Father's <mark4>voice;</mark4><br>
I look't for some great change; to Honour? <mark2>no,</mark2><br>
But trouble, as old Simeon plain <mark4>fore-told,</mark4><br>
That to the fall and rising he should <mark3>be</mark3><br>
Of many in Israel, and to a <mark4>sign</mark4><br>
Spoken against, that through my very <mark4>Soul</mark4><br>
A sword shall pierce, this is my favour'd <mark1>lot,</mark1><br>
My Exaltation to Afflictions <mark1>high;</mark1><br>
Afflicted I may be, it seems, and <mark1>blest;</mark1><br>
I will not argue that, nor will <mark5>repine.</mark5><br>
But where delays he now? some great <mark4>intent</mark4><br>
Conceals him: when twelve years he scarce had <mark1>seen,</mark1><br>
I lost him, but so found, as well I <mark1>saw</mark1><br>
He could not lose himself; but went <mark4>about</mark4><br>
His Father's business; what he meant I mus'd, <br>
Since understand; much more his absence <mark1>now</mark1><br>
Thus long to some great purpose he <mark4>obscures.</mark4><br>
But I to wait with patience am inur'd; <br>
My heart hath been a store-house long of <mark4>things</mark4><br>
And sayings laid up, portending strange <mark4>events.</mark4><br>
Thus Mary pondering oft, and oft to <mark4>mind</mark4><br>
Recalling what remarkably had <mark4>pass'd</mark4><br>
Since first her Salutation heard, with <mark4>thoughts</mark4><br>
Meekly compos'd awaited the <mark4>fulfilling:</mark4><br>
The while her Son tracing the Desert <mark4>wild,</mark4><br>
Sole but with holiest Meditations <mark4>fed,</mark4><br>
Into himself descended, and at <mark1>once</mark1><br>
All his great work to come before him <mark4>set;</mark4><br>
How to begin, how to accomplish <mark4>best</mark4><br>
His end of being on Earth, and mission <mark1>high:</mark1><br>
For Satan with slye preface to <mark1>return</mark1><br>
Had left him vacant, and with speed was <mark5>gon</mark5><br>
Up to the middle Region of thick <mark4>Air,</mark4><br>
Where all his Potentates in Council <mark4>sate;</mark4><br>
There without sign of boast, or sign of <mark3>joy,</mark3><br>
Sollicitous and blank he thus <mark4>began.</mark4><br>
Princes, Heavens antient Sons, AEthereal <mark5>Thrones,</mark5><br>
Demonian Spirits now, from the <mark4>Element</mark4><br>
Each of his reign allotted, rightlier <mark1>call'd,</mark1><br>
Powers of Fire, Air, Water, and Earth <mark4>beneath,</mark4><br>
So may we hold our place and these mild <mark4>seats</mark4><br>
Without new trouble; such an <mark4>Enemy</mark4><br>
Is ris'n to invade <mark3>us</mark3>, who no <mark4>less</mark4><br>
Threat'ns then our expulsion down to <mark4>Hell;</mark4><br>
I, as I undertook, and with the <mark4>vote</mark4><br>
Consenting in full frequence was <mark5>impowr'd,</mark5><br>
Have found him, view'd him, tasted him, but <mark4>find</mark4><br>
Far other labour to be undergon <br>
Then when I dealt with Adam first of <mark4>Men,</mark4><br>
Though Adam by his Wives allurement <mark3>fell,</mark3><br>
However to this Man inferior <mark4>far,</mark4><br>
If he be Man by Mothers side at <mark4>least,</mark4><br>
With more then humane gifts from Heaven <mark4>adorn'd,</mark4><br>
Perfections absolute, Graces <mark4>divine,</mark4><br>
And amplitude of mind to greatest <mark4>Deeds.</mark4><br>
Therefore I am return'd, lest <mark4>confidence</mark4><br>
Of my success with Eve in <mark4>Paradise</mark4><br>
Deceive ye to perswasion <mark4>over-sure</mark4><br>
Of like succeeding here; I summon <mark4>all</mark4><br>
Rather to be in readiness, with <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
Or counsel to assist; lest I who erst <br>
Thought none my equal, now be <mark5>over-match'd.</mark5><br>
So spake the old Serpent doubting, and from <mark1>all</mark1><br>
With clamour was assur'd thir utmost <mark4>aid</mark4><br>
At his command; when from amidst them <mark4>rose</mark4><br>
Belial the dissolutest Spirit that <mark1>fell,</mark1><br>
The sensuallest, and after Asmodai <br>
The fleshliest Incubus, and thus <mark5>advis'd.</mark5><br>
Set women in his eye and in his <mark4>walk,</mark4><br>
Among daughters of men the fairest <mark1>found;</mark1><br>
Many are in each Region passing <mark4>fair</mark4><br>
As the noon Skie; more like to <mark4>Goddesses</mark4><br>
Then Mortal Creatures, graceful and <mark4>discreet,</mark4><br>
Expert in amorous Arts, enchanting <mark4>tongues</mark4><br>
Perswasive, Virgin majesty with <mark4>mild</mark4><br>
And sweet allay'd, yet terrible to <mark5>approach,</mark5><br>
Skill'd to retire, and in retiring <mark3>draw</mark3><br>
Hearts after them tangl'd in Amorous <mark4>Nets.</mark4><br>
Such object hath the power to soft'n and <mark4>tame</mark4><br>
Severest temper, smooth the rugged'st <mark3>brow,</mark3><br>
Enerve, and with voluptuous hope <mark4>dissolve,</mark4><br>
Draw out with credulous desire, and <mark4>lead</mark4><br>
At will the manliest, resolutest <mark4>brest,</mark4><br>
As the Magnetic hardest Iron <mark4>draws.</mark4><br>
Women, when nothing else, beguil'd the <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
Of wisest Solomon, and made him <mark4>build,</mark4><br>
And made him bow to the Gods of his <mark4>Wives.</mark4><br>
To whom quick answer Satan thus <mark4>return'd.</mark4><br>
Belial, in much uneven scale thou <mark4>weigh'st</mark4><br>
All others by thy self; because of <mark1>old</mark1><br>
Thou thy self doat'st on womankind, <mark4>admiring</mark4><br>
Thir shape, thir colour, and attractive <mark4>grace,</mark4><br>
None are, thou <mark4>think'st</mark4>, but taken with such <mark4>toys.</mark4><br>
Before the Flood thou with thy lusty <mark5>Crew,</mark5><br>
False titl'd Sons of God, roaming the <mark4>Earth</mark4><br>
Cast wanton eyes on the daughters of <mark1>men,</mark1><br>
And coupl'd with them, and begot a <mark3>race.</mark3><br>
Have we not seen, or by relation <mark1>heard,</mark1><br>
In Courts and Regal Chambers how thou <mark4>lurk'st,</mark4><br>
In Wood or Grove by mossie Fountain <mark4>side,</mark4><br>
In Valley or Green Meadow to <mark3>way-lay</mark3><br>
Some beauty rare, Calisto, <mark4>Clymene,</mark4><br>
Daphne, or Semele, Antiopa, <br>
Or Amymone, Syrinx, many <mark4>more</mark4><br>
Too long, then lay'st thy scapes on names <mark4>ador'd,</mark4><br>
Apollo, Neptune, Jupiter, or <mark4>Pan,</mark4><br>
Satyr, or Fawn, or Silvan?   But these <mark4>haunts</mark4><br>
Delight not all; among the Sons of <mark1>Men,</mark1><br>
How many have with a smile made small <mark4>account</mark4><br>
Of beauty and her <mark4>lures</mark4>, easily <mark4>scorn'd</mark4><br>
All her assaults, on worthier things <mark1>intent?</mark1><br>
Remember that Pellean Conquerour, <br>
A youth, how all the Beauties of the <mark4>East</mark4><br>
He slightly view'd, and slightly <mark5>over-pass'd;</mark5><br>
How hee sirnam'd of Africa <mark4>dismiss'd</mark4><br>
In his prime youth the fair Iberian <mark4>maid.</mark4><br>
For Solomon he liv'd at ease, and <mark4>full</mark4><br>
Of honour, wealth, high fare, aim'd not <mark4>beyond</mark4><br>
Higher design then to enjoy his <mark4>State;</mark4><br>
Thence to the bait of Women lay <mark4>expos'd;</mark4><br>
But he whom we attempt is wiser <mark1>far</mark1><br>
Then Solomon, of more exalted <mark1>mind,</mark1><br>
Made and set wholly on the <mark4>accomplishment</mark4><br>
Of greatest things; what woman will you <mark1>find,</mark1><br>
Though of this Age the wonder and the <mark3>fame,</mark3><br>
On whom his leisure will vouchsafe an <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
Of fond desire? or should she <mark4>confident,</mark4><br>
As sitting Queen ador'd on Beauties <mark4>Throne,</mark4><br>
Descend with all her winning charms <mark5>begirt</mark5><br>
To enamour, as the Zone of Venus <mark1>once</mark1><br>
Wrought that effect on Jove, so Fables <mark4>tell;</mark4><br>
How would one look from his Majestick <mark1>brow</mark1><br>
Seated as on the top of Vertues <mark4>hill,</mark4><br>
Discount'nance her despis'd, and put to <mark4>rout</mark4><br>
All her array; her female pride <mark4>deject,</mark4><br>
Or turn to reverent awe? for Beauty <mark4>stands</mark4><br>
In the admiration only of weak <mark4>minds</mark4><br>
Led captive; cease to admire, and all her <mark4>Plumes</mark4><br>
Fall flat and shrink into a trivial <mark3>toy,</mark3><br>
At every sudden slighting quite abasht: <br>
Therefore with manlier objects we must <mark3>try</mark3><br>
His constancy, with such as have more <mark3>shew</mark3><br>
Of worth, of honour, glory, and popular <mark4>praise;</mark4><br>
Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest <mark4>wreck'd;</mark4><br>
Or that which only seems to <mark5>satisfie</mark5><br>
Lawful desires of Nature, not <mark1>beyond;</mark1><br>
And now I know he hungers where no <mark4>food</mark4><br>
Is to be found, in the wide <mark4>Wilderness;</mark4><br>
The rest commit to me, I shall let <mark4>pass</mark4><br>
No advantage, and his strength as oft <mark4>assay.</mark4><br>
He ceas'd, and heard thir grant in loud <mark3>acclaim;</mark3><br>
Then forthwith to him takes a chosen <mark4>band</mark4><br>
Of Spirits likest to himself in <mark4>guile</mark4><br>
To be at hand, and at his beck <mark4>appear,</mark4><br>
If cause were to unfold some active <mark4>Scene</mark4><br>
Of various persons each to know his <mark4>part;</mark4><br>
Then to the Desert takes with these his <mark4>flight;</mark4><br>
Where still from shade to shade the Son of <mark4>God</mark4><br>
After forty days fasting had <mark1>remain'd,</mark1><br>
Now hungring first, and to himself thus <mark4>said.</mark4><br>
Where will this end? four times ten days I have <mark1>pass'd</mark1><br>
Wandring this woody maze, and humane <mark1>food</mark1><br>
Nor tasted, nor had <mark4>appetite</mark4>, that <mark4>Fast</mark4><br>
To Vertue I impute <mark4>not</mark4>, or count <mark1>part</mark1><br>
Of what I suffer here; if Nature need <mark4>not,</mark4><br>
Or God support Nature without <mark5>repast</mark5><br>
Though needing, what praise is it to <mark4>endure?</mark4><br>
But now I feel I hunger, which <mark4>declares,</mark4><br>
Nature hath need of what she asks; yet <mark1>God</mark1><br>
Can satisfie that need some other <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
Though hunger still remain: so it <mark4>remain</mark4><br>
Without this bodies wasting, I content <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
And from the sting of Famine fear no <mark4>harm,</mark4><br>
Nor mind it, fed with better thoughts that <mark4>feed</mark4><br>
Mee hungring more to do my Fathers <mark4>will.</mark4><br>
It was the hour of night, when thus the <mark1>Son</mark1><br>
Commun'd in silent walk, then laid him <mark4>down</mark4><br>
Under the hospitable covert <mark3>nigh</mark3><br>
Of Trees thick interwoven; there he <mark4>slept,</mark4><br>
And dream'd, as appetite is wont to <mark4>dream,</mark4><br>
Of meats and drinks, Natures refreshment <mark4>sweet;</mark4><br>
Him thought, he by the Brook of Cherith <mark4>stood</mark4><br>
And saw the Ravens with their horny <mark5>beaks</mark5><br>
Food to Elijah bringing Even and <mark4>Morn,</mark4><br>
Though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they <mark4>brought:</mark4><br>
He saw the Prophet also how he <mark4>fled</mark4><br>
Into the <mark4>Desert</mark4>, and how there he <mark1>slept</mark1><br>
Under a Juniper; then how awakt, <br>
He found his Supper on the coals prepar'd, <br>
And by the Angel was bid rise and <mark4>eat,</mark4><br>
And eat the second time after <mark4>repose,</mark4><br>
The strength whereof suffic'd him forty <mark1>days;</mark1><br>
Sometimes that with Elijah he <mark5>partook,</mark5><br>
Or as a guest with Daniel at his <mark4>pulse.</mark4><br>
Thus wore out night, and now the Herald <mark4>Lark</mark4><br>
Left his ground-nest, high towring to <mark5>descry</mark5><br>
The morns approach, and greet her with his <mark4>Song:</mark4><br>
As lightly from his grassy Couch up <mark1>rose</mark1><br>
Our Saviour, and found all was but a <mark1>dream,</mark1><br>
Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting wak'd. <br>
Up to a hill anon his steps he <mark4>rear'd,</mark4><br>
From whose high top to ken the prospect <mark4>round,</mark4><br>
If Cottage were in view, Sheep-cote or <mark4>Herd;</mark4><br>
But Cottage, Herd or Sheep-cote none he <mark1>saw,</mark1><br>
Only in a bottom saw a pleasant <mark4>Grove,</mark4><br>
With chaunt of tuneful Birds resounding <mark4>loud;</mark4><br>
Thither he bent his way, determin'd <mark4>there</mark4><br>
To rest at noon, and entr'd soon the <mark4>shade</mark4><br>
High rooft and walks beneath, and alleys <mark4>brown</mark4><br>
That open'd in the midst a woody <mark1>Scene,</mark1><br>
Natures own work it seem'd (Nature taught <mark4>Art)</mark4><br>
And to a Superstitious eye the <mark4>haunt</mark4><br>
Of Wood-Gods and Wood-Nymphs; he view'd it <mark1>round,</mark1><br>
When suddenly a man before him <mark1>stood,</mark1><br>
Not rustic as before, but seemlier <mark1>clad,</mark1><br>
As one in City, or Court, or Palace <mark4>bred,</mark4><br>
And with fair speech these words to him <mark4>address'd.</mark4><br>
With granted leave officious I <mark1>return,</mark1><br>
But much more wonder that the Son of <mark1>God</mark1><br>
In this wild solitude so long should <mark4>bide</mark4><br>
Of all things destitute, and well I <mark2>know,</mark2><br>
Not without hunger.   Others of some <mark4>note,</mark4><br>
As story tells, have trod this <mark1>Wilderness;</mark1><br>
The Fugitive Bond-woman with her <mark1>Son</mark1><br>
Out cast Nebaioth, yet found he <mark4>relief</mark4><br>
By a providing Angel; all the <mark1>race</mark1><br>
Of Israel here had famish'd, had not <mark1>God</mark1><br>
Rain'd from Heaven Manna, and that Prophet <mark4>bold</mark4><br>
Native of Thebes wandring here was <mark1>fed</mark1><br>
Twice by a voice inviting him to <mark1>eat.</mark1><br>
Of thee these forty days none hath <mark4>regard,</mark4><br>
Forty and more deserted here <mark4>indeed.</mark4><br>
To whom thus <mark4>Jesus</mark4>, what conclud'st thou <mark1>hence?</mark1><br>
They all had need, I as thou seest have <mark1>none.</mark1><br>
How hast thou hunger then? Satan <mark4>reply'd,</mark4><br>
Tell me if Food were now before thee <mark1>set,</mark1><br>
Would'st thou not eat? Thereafter as I <mark4>like</mark4><br>
The giver, answer'd Jesus. Why should <mark4>that</mark4><br>
Cause thy refusal, said the subtle <mark4>Fiend,</mark4><br>
Hast thou not right to all Created <mark1>things,</mark1><br>
Owe not all Creatures by just right to <mark3>thee</mark3><br>
Duty and Service, nor to stay till <mark4>bid,</mark4><br>
But tender all their power? nor mention <mark3>I</mark3><br>
Meats by the Law unclean, or offer'd <mark4>first</mark4><br>
To <mark4>Idols</mark4>, those young Daniel could <mark4>refuse;</mark4><br>
Nor proffer'd by an Enemy, though <mark3>who</mark3><br>
Would scruple that, with want opprest? <mark4>behold</mark4><br>
Nature asham'd, or better to <mark4>express,</mark4><br>
Troubl'd that thou shouldst hunger, hath <mark4>purvey'd</mark4><br>
From all the Elements her choicest <mark4>store</mark4><br>
To treat thee as beseems, and as her <mark4>Lord</mark4><br>
With honour, only deign to sit and <mark1>eat.</mark1><br>
He spake no dream, for as his words had <mark4>end,</mark4><br>
Our Saviour lifting up his eyes <mark1>beheld</mark1><br>
In ample space under the broadest <mark1>shade</mark1><br>
A Table richly spred, in regal <mark4>mode,</mark4><br>
With dishes pill'd, and meats of noblest <mark4>sort</mark4><br>
And savour, Beasts of chase, or Fowl of <mark4>game,</mark4><br>
In pastry built, or from the spit, or boyl'd, <br>
Gris-amber-steam'd; all Fish from Sea or <mark3>Shore,</mark3><br>
Freshet, or purling Brook, of shell or <mark4>fin,</mark4><br>
And exquisitest name, for which was <mark4>drain'd</mark4><br>
Pontus and Lucrine Bay, and Afric <mark4>Coast.</mark4><br>
Alas how simple, to these Cates <mark5>compar'd,</mark5><br>
Was that crude Apple that diverted <mark4>Eve!</mark4><br>
And at a stately side-board by the <mark4>wine</mark4><br>
That fragrant smell diffus'd, in order <mark1>stood</mark1><br>
Tall stripling youths rich clad, of fairer <mark3>hew</mark3><br>
Then Ganymed or Hylas, distant <mark1>more</mark1><br>
Under the Trees now trip'd, now solemn <mark1>stood</mark1><br>
Nymphs of Diana's train, and Naiades <br>
With fruits and flowers from Amalthea's <mark4>horn,</mark4><br>
And Ladies of th' Hesperides, that <mark4>seem'd</mark4><br>
Fairer then feign'd of old, or fabl'd <mark4>since</mark4><br>
Of Fairy Damsels met in Forest <mark4>wide</mark4><br>
By Knights of Logres, or of Lyones, <br>
Lancelot or Pelleas, or Pellenore, <br>
And all the while Harmonious Airs were <mark1>heard</mark1><br>
Of chiming <mark4>strings</mark4>, or charming pipes and <mark4>winds</mark4><br>
Of gentlest gale Arabian odors <mark4>fann'd</mark4><br>
From their soft <mark4>wings</mark4>, and Flora's earliest <mark4>smells.</mark4><br>
Such was the Splendour, and the Tempter <mark1>now</mark1><br>
His invitation earnestly <mark4>renew'd.</mark4><br>
What doubts the Son of God to sit and <mark1>eat?</mark1><br>
These are not Fruits forbidden, no <mark4>interdict</mark4><br>
Defends the touching of these viands <mark1>pure,</mark1><br>
Thir taste no knowledge works, at least of <mark4>evil,</mark4><br>
But life preserves, destroys life's <mark1>enemy,</mark1><br>
Hunger, with sweet restorative <mark4>delight.</mark4><br>
All these are Spirits of Air, and <mark4>Woods</mark4>, and <mark4>Springs,</mark4><br>
Thy gentle Ministers, who come to <mark3>pay</mark3><br>
Thee homage, and acknowledge thee thir <mark1>Lord:</mark1><br>
What doubt'st thou Son of God? sit down and <mark1>eat.</mark1><br>
To whom thus Jesus temperately <mark1>reply'd:</mark1><br>
Said'st thou not that to all things I had <mark4>right?</mark4><br>
And who withholds my pow'r that right to <mark4>use?</mark4><br>
Shall I receive by gift what of my <mark4>own,</mark4><br>
When and where likes me best, I can <mark4>command?</mark4><br>
I can at will, doubt not, as soon as <mark3>thou,</mark3><br>
Command a Table in this <mark1>Wilderness,</mark1><br>
And call swift flights of Angels <mark5>ministrant</mark5><br>
Array'd in Glory on my cup to <mark4>attend:</mark4><br>
Why shouldst thou then obtrude this <mark4>diligence,</mark4><br>
In vain, where no acceptance it can <mark1>find,</mark1><br>
And with my hunger what has thou to <mark3>do?</mark3><br>
Thy pompous Delicacies I <mark5>contemn,</mark5><br>
And count thy specious gifts no gifts but <mark4>guiles.</mark4><br>
   To whom thus answer'd Satan malecontent: <br>
That I have also power to give thou <mark5>seest,</mark5><br>
If of that pow'r I bring thee <mark4>voluntary</mark4><br>
What I might have bestow'd on whom I <mark4>pleas'd,</mark4><br>
And rather opportunely in this <mark4>place</mark4><br>
Chose to impart to thy apparent <mark4>need,</mark4><br>
Why shouldst thou not accept it? but I <mark3>see</mark3><br>
What I can do or offer is <mark4>suspect;</mark4><br>
Of these things others quickly will <mark4>dispose</mark4><br>
Whose pains have earn'd the far fet spoil. With <mark1>that</mark1><br>
Both Table and Provision vanish'd <mark4>quite</mark4><br>
With sound of Harpies wings, and Talons <mark1>heard;</mark1><br>
Only the importune Tempter still <mark1>remain'd,</mark1><br>
And with these words his temptation <mark5>pursu'd.</mark5><br>
By hunger, that each other Creature <mark4>tames,</mark4><br>
Thou art not to be harm'd, therefore not mov'd; <br>
Thy temperance invincible <mark4>besides,</mark4><br>
For no allurement yields to <mark4>appetite,</mark4><br>
And all thy heart is set on high <mark4>designs,</mark4><br>
High actions; but wherewith to be atchiev'd? <br>
Great acts require great means of <mark4>enterprise,</mark4><br>
Thou art unknown, unfriended, low of <mark3>birth,</mark3><br>
A Carpenter thy Father known, thy <mark4>self</mark4><br>
Bred up in poverty and streights at <mark4>home;</mark4><br>
Lost in a Desert here and <mark4>hunger-bit:</mark4><br>
Which way or from what hope dost thou <mark4>aspire</mark4><br>
To greatness? whence Authority deriv'st, <br>
What Followers, what Retinue canst thou <mark4>gain,</mark4><br>
Or at thy heels the dizzy <mark4>Multitude,</mark4><br>
Longer then thou canst feed them on thy <mark4>cost?</mark4><br>
Money brings Honour, Friends, Conquest, and <mark4>Realms;</mark4><br>
What rais'd Antipater the Edomite, <br>
And his Son Herod plac'd on Juda's <mark1>Throne;</mark1><br>
(Thy throne) but gold that got him puissant <mark4>friends?</mark4><br>
Therefore, if at great things thou wouldst <mark4>arrive,</mark4><br>
Get Riches first, get Wealth, and Treasure <mark5>heap,</mark5><br>
Not difficult, if thou hearken to <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Riches are mine, Fortune is in my <mark1>hand;</mark1><br>
They whom I favour thrive in wealth <mark5>amain,</mark5><br>
While Virtue, Valour, Wisdom sit in <mark4>want.</mark4><br>
To whom thus Jesus patiently <mark1>reply'd;</mark1><br>
Yet Wealth without these three is <mark4>impotent,</mark4><br>
To gain dominion or to keep it <mark4>gain'd.</mark4><br>
Witness those antient Empires of the <mark1>Earth,</mark1><br>
In highth of all thir flowing wealth <mark5>dissolv'd:</mark5><br>
But men endu'd with these have oft <mark3>attain'd</mark3><br>
In lowest poverty to highest <mark1>deeds;</mark1><br>
Gideon and Jephtha, and the Shepherd <mark4>lad,</mark4><br>
Whose off-spring on the Throne of Juda <mark4>sat</mark4><br>
So many Ages, and shall yet <mark4>regain</mark4><br>
That seat, and reign in Israel without <mark1>end.</mark1><br>
Among the Heathen, (for throughout the <mark4>World</mark4><br>
To me is not unknown what hath been <mark4>done</mark4><br>
Worthy of Memorial) canst thou not <mark4>remember</mark4><br>
Quintius, Fabricius, Curius, Regulus? <br>
For I esteem those names of men so <mark4>poor</mark4><br>
Who could do mighty things, and could <mark1>contemn</mark1><br>
Riches though offer'd from the hand of <mark4>Kings.</mark4><br>
And what in me seems wanting, but that <mark1>I</mark1><br>
May also in this poverty as <mark4>soon</mark4><br>
Accomplish what they did, perhaps and <mark1>more?</mark1><br>
Extol not Riches then, the toyl of <mark4>Fools,</mark4><br>
The wise mans cumbrance if not snare, more <mark4>apt</mark4><br>
To slacken Virtue, and abate her edge, <br>
Then prompt her to do aught may merit <mark1>praise.</mark1><br>
What if with like aversion I <mark4>reject</mark4><br>
Riches and Realms; yet not for that a <mark4>Crown,</mark4><br>
Golden in shew, is but a wreath of <mark4>thorns,</mark4><br>
Brings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless <mark4>nights</mark4><br>
To him who wears the Regal <mark4>Diadem,</mark4><br>
When on his shoulders each mans burden <mark4>lies;</mark4><br>
For therein stands the office of a <mark1>King,</mark1><br>
His Honour, Vertue, Merit and chief <mark1>Praise,</mark1><br>
That for the Publick all this weight he <mark4>bears.</mark4><br>
Yet he who reigns within himself, and <mark4>rules</mark4><br>
Passions, Desires, and Fears, is more a <mark1>King;</mark1><br>
Which every wise and vertuous man <mark4>attains:</mark4><br>
And who attains not, ill aspires to <mark4>rule</mark4><br>
Cities of men or head-strong <mark4>Multitudes,</mark4><br>
Subject himself to Anarchy <mark4>within,</mark4><br>
Or lawless passions in him which he <mark4>serves.</mark4><br>
But to guide Nations in the way of <mark1>truth</mark1><br>
By saving Doctrine, and from errour <mark1>lead</mark1><br>
To know, and knowing worship God aright, <br>
Is yet more Kingly, this attracts the <mark1>Soul,</mark1><br>
Governs the inner man, the nobler <mark1>part,</mark1><br>
That other o're the body only <mark4>reigns,</mark4><br>
And oft by force, which to a generous <mark1>mind</mark1><br>
So reigning can be no sincere <mark1>delight.</mark1><br>
Besides to give a Kingdom hath been <mark4>thought</mark4><br>
Greater and nobler <mark4>done</mark4>, and to lay <mark1>down</mark1><br>
Far more magnanimous, then to <mark4>assume.</mark4><br>
Riches are needless then, both for <mark4>themselves,</mark4><br>
And for thy reason why they should be <mark3>sought,</mark3><br>
To gain a Scepter, oftest better <mark4>miss't.</mark4><br>
