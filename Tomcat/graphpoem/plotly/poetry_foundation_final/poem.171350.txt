THE MIND IS AN ANCIENT AND FAMOUS <mark1>CAPITAL</mark1><br>
<br>
The mind is a city like <mark4>London,</mark4><br>
Smoky and populous: it is a <mark1>capital</mark1><br>
Like Rome, ruined and <mark4>eternal,</mark4><br>
Marked by the monuments which no <mark4>one</mark4><br>
Now remembers. For the mind, like Rome, <mark4>contains</mark4><br>
Catacombs, aqueducts, amphitheatres, <mark4>palaces,</mark4><br>
Churches and equestrian statues, fallen, broken or <mark4>soiled.</mark4><br>
The mind possesses and is possessed by all the <mark4>ruins</mark4><br>
Of every haunted, hunted generation's <mark4>celebration.</mark4><br>
<br>
"Call us what you will: we are made such by <mark1>love."</mark1><br>
We are such studs as dreams are made on, <mark4>and</mark4><br>
Our little lives are ruled by the gods, by <mark4>Pan,</mark4><br>
Piping of all, seeking to grasp or <mark4>grasping</mark4><br>
All of the grapes; and by the bow-and-arrow <mark4>god,</mark4><br>
Cupid, piercing the heart through, suddenly and <mark5>forever.</mark5><br>
<br>
Dusk we are, to dusk returning, after the burbing,   <br>
After the gold fall, the fallen ash, the <mark4>bronze,</mark4><br>
Scattered and rotten, after the white null statues which   <br>
Are winter, sleep, and nothingness: <mark4>when</mark4><br>
Will the houselights of the <mark4>universe</mark4><br>
Light up and <mark4>blaze?</mark4><br>
For it is not the <mark3>sea</mark3><br>
Which murmurs in a <mark4>shell,</mark4><br>
And it is not only heart, at harp <mark4>o'clock,</mark4><br>
It is the dread terror of the <mark4>uncontrollable</mark4><br>
Horses of the apocalypse, running in wild <mark4>dread</mark4><br>
Toward Arcturus--and returning as suddenly <mark4>...</mark4><br>
<br>
THE FEAR AND DREAD OF THE MIND OF THE <mark4>OTHERS</mark4><br>
--The others were the despots of <mark4>despair--</mark4><br>
<br>
The river's freshness sailed from unknown <mark4>sources--</mark4><br>
<br>
... They snickered giggled, laughed aloud at <mark4>last,</mark4><br>
<br>
They mocked and marvelled at the statue which <mark4>was</mark4><br>
A caricature, as strained and stiff, and <mark4>yet</mark4><br>
A statue of self-love!--since self-love <mark1>was</mark1><br>
To them, truly my true love, how, then, was I a stillness of <mark4>nervousness</mark4><br>
So nervous a caricature: did they <mark4>suppose</mark4><br>
Self-love was <mark4>unrequited</mark4>, or <mark4>betrayed?</mark4><br>
They thought I had fallen in love with my own <mark4>face,</mark4><br>
And this belief became the night-like <mark4>obstacle</mark4><br>
To understanding all my unbroken <mark4>suffering,</mark4><br>
My studious self-regard, the pain of <mark1>hope,</mark1><br>
The torment of possibility: <br>
How then could I have expected them to see <mark3>me</mark3><br>
As I saw myself, within my gaze, or <mark3>see</mark3><br>
That being thus seemed as a toad, a frog, a wen, a <mark4>mole.</mark4><br>
Knowing their certainty that I was <mark4>only</mark4><br>
A monument, a monster who had fallen in <mark1>love</mark1><br>
With himself alone, how could I <mark4>have</mark4><br>
Told them what was in me, within my <mark4>heart</mark4>, trembling and <mark4>passionate</mark4><br>
Within the labyrinth and caves of my mind, which <mark4>is</mark4><br>
Like every mind partly or wholly hidden from <mark1>itself?</mark1><br>
The words for what is in my heart and in my <mark4>mind</mark4><br>
Do not exist. But I must seek and search to <mark3>find</mark3><br>
Amid the vines and orchards of the vivid world of <mark3>day</mark3><br>
Approximate <mark4>images</mark4>, imaginary <mark4>parallels</mark4><br>
For what is my heart and dark within my <mark1>mind:</mark1><br>
Comparisons and mere metaphors: for <mark4>all</mark4><br>
Of them are substitutes, both counterfeit and vague: <br>
They are, at most, deceptive <mark4>resemblances,</mark4><br>
False in their very likeness, like the <mark4>sons</mark4><br>
Who are alike and kin and more unlike and <mark4>false</mark4><br>
Because they seem the father's very self: but each one <mark1>is</mark1><br>
--Although begotten by the same <mark5>forbears--himself,</mark5><br>
The unique self, each one is unique, like every other <mark1>one,</mark1><br>
And everything, older or younger, <mark4>nevertheless</mark4><br>
A passionate nonesuch who has before has <mark4>been.</mark4><br>
Do you hear, do you see? Do you understand me <mark3>now</mark3>, and <mark3>how</mark3><br>
The words for what is my heart do not <mark4>exist?</mark4><br>
THE RIVER WAS THE EMBLEM OF ALL BEAUTY:   <mark1>ALL</mark1><br>
<br>
The river was the abundant belly of beauty <mark1>itself</mark1><br>
The river was the dream space where I <mark4>walked,</mark4><br>
<br>
The river was itself and yet it was--flowing and <mark4>freshening--</mark4><br>
A self anew, another self, or self <mark4>renewed</mark4><br>
At every tick of eternity, and by each glint of <mark4>light</mark4><br>
Mounting or sparkling, descending to shade and <mark4>black</mark4><br>
--Had I but told them my heart, told how it <mark1>was</mark1><br>
Taunted at noon and pacified at dusk, at starfall <mark4>midnight</mark4><br>
Strong in hope once more, ever in <mark4>eagerness</mark4><br>
Jumping like joy, would they have heard? How could <mark3>they?</mark3><br>
How, when what they knew was, like the <mark4>grass,</mark4><br>
Simple and certain, known through the truth of touch, another form and fountain of falsehood's <mark4>fecundity--</mark4><br>
Gazing upon their faces as they <mark4>gazed</mark4><br>
Could they have seen my faces as whores who <mark4>are</mark4><br>
Holy and deified as priestesses of <mark1>hope</mark1><br>
                         --the sacred virgins of futurity-- <br>
Promising dear divinity precisely <mark3>because</mark3><br>
They were disfigured ducks who might <mark5>become</mark5><br>
And be, and ever beloved, white swans, noble and <mark4>beautiful.</mark4><br>
                                    Could they have seen how my faces were <br>
Bonfires of worship and vigil, blazes of adoration and <mark1>hope</mark1><br>
--Surely they would have laughed <mark4>again</mark4>, renewed their <mark4>scorn,</mark4><br>
Giggled and snickered, cruel. Surely have <mark4>said</mark4><br>
This is the puerile mania of the <mark4>obsessed,</mark4><br>
The living logic of the <mark4>lunatic:</mark4><br>
I was the statue of their merriment, <br>
Dead and a death, Pharoah and monster forsaken and <mark4>lost.</mark4><br>
My faces were my apes: my apes <mark4>became</mark4><br>
Performers in the Sundays of their <mark4>parks,</mark4><br>
Buffoons or clowns in the farce or <mark4>comedy</mark4><br>
<br>
When they took pleasure in knowing that they were not like <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
I waited like obsession in <mark4>solitude:</mark4><br>
The sun's white terror tore and roared at <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
The moonlight, almond <mark3>white</mark3>, at <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
Whether awake or sleeping, arrested <mark1>me</mark1><br>
<br>
And sang, softly, haunted, unlike the <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
But as the sun. Withheld from me or took <mark3>away</mark3><br>
Despair or peace, making me once <mark4>more</mark4><br>
With thought of what had never been <mark3>before----</mark3><br>
