Author : Siegfried Sassoon <br><br>

Adam, a brown old vulture in the <mark3>rain,</mark3><br>
Shivered below his wind-whipped <mark3>olive-trees;</mark3><br>
Huddling sharp chin on scarred and scraggy <mark3>knees,</mark3><br>
He moaned and mumbled to his darkening <mark3>brain;</mark3><br>
'He was the grandest of them all--was <mark3>Cain!</mark3><br>
'A lion laired in the hills, that none could <mark3>tire;</mark3><br>
'Swift as a stag; a stallion of the <mark3>plain,</mark3><br>
'Hungry and fierce with deeds of huge <mark3>desire.'</mark3><br>
<br>
Grimly he thought of Abel, soft and <mark3>fair--</mark3><br>
A lover with disaster in his <mark3>face,</mark3><br>
And scarlet blossom twisted in bright <mark3>hair.</mark3><br>
'Afraid to fight; was murder more disgrace? <mark3>...</mark3><br>
'God always hated Cain' ... He bowed his <mark3>head--</mark3><br>
The gaunt wild man whose lovely sons were <mark3>dead.</mark3><br>
