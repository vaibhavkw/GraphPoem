Title : Finis <br>
Author : Marjorie Pickthall <br><br>

Give me a few more hours to <mark3>pass</mark3><br>
With the mellow flower of the elm-bough <mark4>falling,</mark4><br>
And then no more than the lonely <mark3>grass</mark3><br>
And the birds <mark4>calling.</mark4><br>
<br>
Give me a few more days to <mark3>keep</mark3><br>
With a little love and a little sorrow,<br>
And then the dawn in the skies of <mark3>sleep</mark3><br>
And a clear to-morrow.<br>
<br>
Give me a few more years to <mark3>fill</mark3><br>
With a little work and a little <mark4>lending,</mark4><br>
And then the night on a starry <mark3>hill</mark3><br>
And the road's <mark3>ending.</mark3><br>
