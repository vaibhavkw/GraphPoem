Title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 39 <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

Old warder of these buried <mark3>bones,</mark3><br>
And answering now my random <mark3>stroke</mark3><br>
With fruitful cloud and living <mark3>smoke,</mark3><br>
Dark yew, that graspest at the <mark3>stones</mark3><br>
<br>
And dippest toward the dreamless <mark3>head,</mark3><br>
To thee too comes the golden <mark3>hour</mark3><br>
When flower is feeling after <mark3>flower;</mark3><br>
But Sorrowifixt upon the <mark3>dead,</mark3><br>
<br>
And darkening the dark graves of men,i <br>
What whisper'd from her lying <mark3>lips?</mark3><br>
Thy gloom is kindled at the <mark3>tips,</mark3><br>
And passes into gloom again. <br>
