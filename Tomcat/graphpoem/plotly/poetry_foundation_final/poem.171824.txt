Title : Witch Doctor <br>
Author : Robert Hayden <br><br>

<br>
He dines alone surrounded by <mark4>reflections</mark4><br>
of himself. Then after sleep and benzedrine   <br>
descends the Cinquecento stair his <mark4>magic</mark4><br>
wrought from hypochondria of the well- <br>
to-do and nagging deathwish of the <mark4>poor;</mark4><br>
swirls on smiling genuflections <mark1>of</mark1><br>
his liveried chauffeur into a <mark4>crested</mark4><br>
lilac limousine, the cynosure <br>
of mousey neighbors tittering <mark4>behind</mark4><br>
Venetian blinds and half afraid of <mark4>him</mark4><br>
and half admiring his outrageous <mark4>flair.</mark4><br>
<br>
Meanwhile his mother, priestess in gold <mark4>lame,</mark4><br>
precedes him to the quondam <mark4>theater</mark4><br>
now Israel Temple of the Highest Alpha,   <br>
where the bored, the sick, the alien, the <mark4>tired</mark4><br>
await euphoria. With deadly <mark4>vigor</mark4><br>
she prepares the way for mystery <br>
and lucre. Shouts in blues-contralto, <mark4>"He's</mark4><br>
God's dictaphone of all-redeeming <mark4>truth.</mark4><br>
Oh he's the holyweight champeen who's <mark4>come</mark4><br>
to give the knockout lick to your bad <mark4>luck;</mark4><br>
say he's the holyweight champeen who's <mark4>here</mark4><br>
to deal a knockout punch to your hard <mark1>luck."</mark1><br>
Reposing on cushions of black leopard <mark4>skin,</mark4><br>
<br>
he telephones instructions for a <mark3>long</mark3><br>
slow drive across the park that burgeons <mark1>now</mark1><br>
with spring and sailors. Peers questingly   <br>
into the green fountainous twilight, <mark4>sighs</mark4><br>
and turns the gold-plate dial to Music <mark4>For</mark4><br>
Your Dining-Dancing Pleasure. Smoking <mark4>Egyptian</mark4><br>
cigarettes rehearses in his <mark4>mind</mark4><br>
a new device that he must use <mark4>tonight.</mark4><br>
Approaching Israel Temple, mask in <mark4>place,</mark4><br>
he hears ragtime allegros of a <mark3>"Song</mark3><br>
<br>
of Zion" that becomes when he <mark4>appears</mark4><br>
a hallelujah wave for him to <mark4>walk.</mark4><br>
His mother and a rainbow-surpliced <mark4>cordon</mark4><br>
conduct him choiring to the <mark4>altar-stage,</mark4><br>
and there he kneels and seems to pray <mark3>before</mark3><br>
a lighted Jesus painted <mark4>sealskin-brown.</mark4><br>
Then with a glittering flourish he <mark4>arises,</mark4><br>
<mark4>turns</mark4>, gracefully extends his draperied <mark4>arms:</mark4><br>
"Israelites, true Jews, O found lost tribe   <br>
of Israel, receive my blessing <mark1>now.</mark1><br>
Selah, selah." He feels them yearn toward <mark1>him</mark1><br>
as toward a lover, exults before the <mark4>image</mark4><br>
of himself their trust gives back. Stands as though   <br>
in meditation, letting their eyes <mark4>caress</mark4><br>
his garments jewelled and chatoyant, <mark4>cut</mark4><br>
to fall, to flow from his tall <mark4>figure</mark4><br>
dramatically just so. Then all at <mark4>once</mark4><br>
he sways, quivers, gesticulates as <mark4>if</mark4><br>
to ward off blows or kisses, and when he <mark4>speaks</mark4><br>
again he utters wildering vocables, <br>
hypnotic no-words planned (and never <mark4>failing)</mark4><br>
to enmesh his flock in theopathic <mark4>tension.</mark4><br>
Cries of eudaemonic pain <mark4>attest</mark4><br>
his artistry. Behind the mask he <mark4>smiles.</mark4><br>
And now in subtly altering light he <mark4>chants</mark4><br>
and sinuously <mark1>trembles</mark1>, chants and <mark1>trembles</mark1><br>
while convulsive energies of eager <mark4>faith</mark4><br>
surcharge the theater with power <mark1>of</mark1><br>
their <mark4>own</mark4>, a power he has counted <mark4>on</mark4><br>
and for a space allows to carry <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
Dishevelled antiphons proclaim the <mark4>moment</mark4><br>
his followers all day have hungered <mark1>for,</mark1><br>
but which is his <mark4>alone.</mark4><br>
He signals: tambourines begin, <mark4>frenetic</mark4><br>
drumbeat and glissando. He dances from the <mark4>altar,</mark4><br>
robes hissing, flaring, shimmering; down <mark3>aisles</mark3><br>
where mantled guardsmen intercept wild <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
that arduously strain to clutch his <mark4>vestments,</mark4><br>
he dances, dances, ensorcelled and <mark4>aloof,</mark4><br>
the fervid juba of God as <mark4>lover</mark4>, <mark4>healer,</mark4><br>
conjurer. And of himself as <mark4>God.</mark4><br>
