Title : Afterimages <br>
Author : Audre Lorde <br><br>

<br>
However the image <mark4>enters</mark4><br>
its force remains <mark4>within</mark4><br>
my <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
rockstrewn caves where dragonfish <mark4>evolve</mark4><br>
wild for life, relentless and <mark4>acquisitive</mark4><br>
learning to <mark4>survive</mark4><br>
where there is no <mark4>food</mark4><br>
my eyes are always <mark4>hungry</mark4><br>
and <mark4>remembering</mark4><br>
however the image <mark1>enters</mark1><br>
its force <mark4>remains.</mark4><br>
A white woman stands bereft and <mark4>empty</mark4><br>
a black boy hacked into a murderous <mark4>lesson</mark4><br>
recalled in me <mark4>forever</mark4><br>
like a lurch of earth on the edge of <mark3>sleep</mark3><br>
etched into my <mark4>visions</mark4><br>
food for dragonfish that <mark4>learn</mark4><br>
to live upon whatever they must <mark4>eat</mark4><br>
fused images beneath my <mark4>pain.</mark4><br>
<br>
The Pearl River floods through the streets of <mark4>Jackson</mark4><br>
A Mississippi summer <mark4>televised.</mark4><br>
Trapped houses kneel like sinners in the <mark4>rain</mark4><br>
a white woman climbs from her roof to a passing <mark4>boat</mark4><br>
her fingers tarry for a moment on the <mark4>chimney</mark4><br>
now <mark4>awash</mark4><br>
tearless and no longer young, she <mark4>holds</mark4><br>
a tattered baby's blanket in her <mark4>arms.</mark4><br>
In a flickering afterimage of the nightmare <mark1>rain</mark1><br>
a <mark4>microphone</mark4><br>
thrust up against her flat bewildered <mark4>words</mark4><br>
          "we jest come from the bank yestiddy   <br>
borrowing money to pay the income <mark4>tax</mark4><br>
now everything's gone. I never <mark3>knew</mark3><br>
it could be so <mark4>hard."</mark4><br>
Despair weighs down her voice like Pearl River <mark4>mud</mark4><br>
caked around the <mark4>edges</mark4><br>
her pale eyes scanning the camera for help or <mark4>explanation</mark4><br>
she shifts her search across the watered street, <mark4>dry-eyed</mark4><br>
<br>
<mark1>"hard</mark1>, but not this <mark1>hard."</mark1><br>
Two tow-headed children hurl themselves against her   <br>
hanging upon her coat like <mark4>mirrors</mark4><br>
until a man with ham-like hands pulls her <mark4>aside</mark4><br>
snarling "She ain't got nothing more to <mark3>say!"</mark3><br>
and that lie hangs in his mouth <br>
like a shred of rotting <mark4>meat.</mark4><br>
I inherited Jackson, <mark4>Mississippi.</mark4><br>
<br>
For my majority it gave me Emmett <mark4>Till</mark4><br>
his 15 years puffed out like <mark4>bruises</mark4><br>
on plump <mark4>boy-cheeks</mark4><br>
his only Mississippi <mark4>summer</mark4><br>
whistling a 21 gun salute to <mark4>Dixie</mark4><br>
as a white girl passed him in the <mark3>street</mark3><br>
and he was baptized my son <mark1>forever</mark1><br>
in the midnight waters of the <mark4>Pearl.</mark4><br>
His broken body is the afterimage of my 21st <mark4>year</mark4><br>
when I walked through a northern <mark1>summer</mark1><br>
<br>
my eyes <mark4>averted</mark4><br>
from each corner's photographies   <br>
newspapers protest posters <mark4>magazines</mark4><br>
Police Story, Confidential, <mark3>True</mark3><br>
the avid insistence of <mark4>detail</mark4><br>
pretending insight or <mark3>information</mark3><br>
the length of gash across the dead boy's loins <br>
his grieving mother's lamentation   <br>
the severed lips, how many <mark4>burns</mark4><br>
his gouged out <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
sewed shut upon the screaming <mark4>covers</mark4><br>
louder than life <br>
all <mark4>over</mark4><br>
the veiled warning, the secret <mark4>relish</mark4><br>
of a black child's mutilated <mark4>body</mark4><br>
fingered by street-corner <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
bruise upon livid <mark4>bruise</mark4><br>
and wherever I looked that <mark1>summer</mark1><br>
I learned to be at home with children's <mark4>blood</mark4><br>
with savored <mark4>violence</mark4><br>
with pictures of black broken <mark4>flesh</mark4><br>
used, <mark4>crumpled</mark4>, and <mark4>discarded</mark4><br>
lying amid the sidewalk <mark3>refuse</mark3><br>
like a raped woman's <mark4>face.</mark4><br>
A black boy from Chicago <br>
whistled on the streets of Jackson, <mark1>Mississippi</mark1><br>
<br>
testing what he'd been taught was a manly thing to <mark3>do</mark3><br>
his <mark4>teachers</mark4><br>
ripped his eyes out his sex his <mark4>tongue</mark4><br>
and flung him to the Pearl weighted with <mark4>stone</mark4><br>
in the name of white <mark4>womanhood</mark4><br>
they took their aroused <mark4>honor</mark4><br>
back to <mark1>Jackson</mark1><br>
and celebrated in a <mark4>whorehouse</mark4><br>
the double ritual of white <mark3>manhood</mark3><br>
"If earth and air and water do not judge them who <mark3>are</mark3><br>
we to refuse a crust of <mark4>bread?"</mark4><br>
<br>
Emmett Till rides the crest of the Pearl, <mark4>whistling</mark4><br>
<br>
24 years his ghost lay like the shade of a raped <mark4>woman</mark4><br>
and a white girl has grown older in costly <mark1>honor</mark1><br>
<br>
(what did she pay to never know its <mark4>price?)</mark4><br>
now the Pearl River speaks its muddy <mark4>judgment</mark4><br>
and I can withhold my pity and my <mark1>bread.</mark1><br>
<mark1>"Hard</mark1>, but not this <mark1>hard."</mark1><br>
Her face is flat with resignation and <mark4>despair</mark4><br>
with ancient and familiar <mark4>sorrows</mark4><br>
<br>
a woman surveying her crumpled <mark4>future</mark4><br>
as the white girl besmirched by Emmett's <mark4>whistle</mark4><br>
never allowed her own <mark1>tongue</mark1><br>
without power or <mark4>conclusion</mark4><br>
she stands adrift in the ruins of her <mark1>honor</mark1><br>
and a man with an executioner's <mark1>face</mark1><br>
pulls her <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
<br>
Within my <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
the flickering afterimages of a nightmare <mark1>rain</mark1><br>
a woman wrings her <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
<br>
beneath the weight of agonies <mark4>remembered</mark4><br>
I wade through summer <mark4>ghosts</mark4><br>
betrayed by <mark4>vision</mark4><br>
hers and my <mark4>own</mark4><br>
becoming dragonfish to <mark1>survive</mark1><br>
the horrors we are <mark4>living</mark4><br>
with tortured <mark4>lungs</mark4><br>
adapting to breathe <mark1>blood.</mark1><br>
A woman measures her life's damage <br>
my eyes are caves, chunks of etched rock <br>
tied to the ghost of a black <mark5>boy</mark5><br>
<br>
crying and <mark4>frightened</mark4><br>
her tow-headed children <mark4>cluster</mark4><br>
like little mirrors of <mark1>despair</mark1><br>
<br>
their father's hands upon them   <br>
and soundlessly <br>
a woman begins to <mark3>weep.</mark3><br>
