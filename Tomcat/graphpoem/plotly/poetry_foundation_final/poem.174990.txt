Title : Success is counted sweetest (112) <br>
Author : Emily Dickinson <br><br>

Success is counted <mark4>sweetest</mark4><br>
By those who ne'er <mark3>succeed.</mark3><br>
To comprehend a nectar <br>
Requires sorest <mark3>need.</mark3><br>
<br>
Not one of all the purple <mark4>Host</mark4><br>
Who took the Flag today <br>
Can tell the definition <br>
So clear of victory <br>
<br>
As he defeated - dying - <br>
On whose forbidden <mark3>ear</mark3><br>
The distant strains of triumph <br>
Burst agonized and <mark3>clear!</mark3><br>
