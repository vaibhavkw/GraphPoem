Title : Too Many Daves <br>
Author : Theodor Geisel <br><br>

Did I ever tell you that Mrs. <mark5>McCave</mark5><br>
Had twenty-three sons and she named them all <mark5>Dave?</mark5><br>
Well, she did.   And that wasn't a smart thing to <mark3>do.</mark3><br>
You see, when she wants one and calls out, <mark3>"Yoo-Hoo!</mark3><br>
Come into the house, Dave!" she doesn't get <mark3>one.</mark3><br>
All twenty-three Daves of hers come on the <mark3>run!</mark3><br>
This makes things quite difficult at the <mark5>McCaves'</mark5><br>
As you can imagine, with so many <mark5>Daves.</mark5><br>
And often she wishes that, when they were <mark4>born,</mark4><br>
She had named one of them Bodkin Van <mark3>Horn</mark3><br>
And one of them Hoos-Foos.   And one of them Snimm. <br>
And one of them Hot-Shot.   And one Sunny Jim. <br>
And one of them Shadrack.   And one of them Blinkey. <br>
And one of them Stuffy.   And one of them Stinkey. <br>
Another one Putt-Putt.   Another one Moon <mark1>Face.</mark1><br>
Another one Marvin O'Gravel Balloon <mark1>Face.</mark1><br>
And one of them Ziggy.   And one Soggy <mark3>Muff.</mark3><br>
One Buffalo Bill.   And one Biffalo <mark3>Buff.</mark3><br>
And one of them Sneepy.   And one Weepy <mark3>Weed.</mark3><br>
And one Paris Garters.   And one Harris <mark3>Tweed.</mark3><br>
And one of them Sir Michael Carmichael Zutt <br>
And one of them Oliver Boliver <mark4>Butt</mark4><br>
And one of them Zanzibar Buck-Buck McFate <mark4>...</mark4><br>
But she didn't do <mark4>it</mark4>, And now it's too <mark3>late.</mark3><br>
