Title : Bereavement <br>
Author : William Lisle Bowles <br><br>

Whose was that gentle voice, <mark4>that</mark4>, whispering <mark4>sweet,</mark4><br>
Promised methought long days of bliss <mark3>sincere!</mark3><br>
Soothing it stole on my deluded <mark3>ear,</mark3><br>
Most like soft music, that might sometimes <mark3>cheat</mark3><br>
Thoughts dark and drooping! 'Twas the voice of <mark3>Hope.</mark3><br>
Of love and social scenes, it seemed to <mark3>speak,</mark3><br>
Of truth, of friendship, of affection <mark3>meek;</mark3><br>
That, oh! poor friend, might to life's downward <mark3>slope</mark3><br>
Lead us in peace, and bless our latest <mark3>hours.</mark3><br>
Ah me! the prospect saddened as she <mark3>sung;</mark3><br>
Loud on my startled ear the death-bell <mark3>rung;</mark3><br>
Chill darkness wrapt the pleasurable <mark3>bowers,</mark3><br>
Whilst Horror, pointing to yon breathless <mark3>clay,</mark3><br>
"No peace be thine," exclaimed, <mark2>"away</mark2>, <mark3>away!"</mark3><br>
