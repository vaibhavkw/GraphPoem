Title : Friendship's Mystery, To my Dearest Lucasia <br>
Author : Katherine Philips <br><br>

<br>
Come, my Lucasia, since we <mark3>see</mark3><br>
That Miracles Mens faith do <mark3>move,</mark3><br>
By wonder and by <mark5>prodigy</mark5><br>
To the dull angry world let's <mark3>prove</mark3><br>
There's a Religion in our <mark4>Love.</mark4><br>
For though we were design'd t' <mark3>agree,</mark3><br>
<br>
      That Fate no liberty destroyes,<br>
<br>
But our Election is as <mark3>free</mark3><br>
As Angels, who with greedy <mark4>choice</mark4><br>
      Are yet determin'd to their joyes.<br>
Our hearts are doubled by the <mark4>loss,</mark4><br>
Here Mixture is Addition grown <mark4>;</mark4><br>
We both diffuse, and both ingross :<br>
<br>
And we whose minds are so much <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
<br>
Never, yet ever are <mark4>alone.</mark4><br>
We court our own <mark4>Captivity</mark4><br>
Than Thrones more great and innocent <mark4>:</mark4><br>
'Twere banishment to be set <mark1>free,</mark1><br>
Since we wear fetters whose <mark4>intent</mark4><br>
Not Bondage is, but <mark4>Ornament.</mark4><br>
<br>
Divided joyes are tedious <mark3>found,</mark3><br>
<br>
And griefs united easier grow <mark5>:</mark5><br>
We are our selves but by <mark3>rebound,</mark3><br>
And all our Titles shuffled <mark3>so,</mark3><br>
      Both Princes, and both Subjects too.<br>
Our Hearts are mutual Victims <mark4>laid,</mark4><br>
While they (such power in Friendship <mark3>lies)</mark3><br>
<br>
Are Altars, Priests, and Off'rings made <mark3>:</mark3><br>
<br>
And each Heart which thus kindly <mark3>dies,</mark3><br>
Grows deathless by the <mark4>Sacrifice.</mark4><br>
