mon semblable, mon <mark4>frere</mark4><br>
<br>
Our epoch takes a voluptuous <mark3>satisfaction</mark3><br>
In that perspective of the <mark3>action</mark3><br>
Which pictures us inhabiting the <mark3>end</mark3><br>
Of everything with death for only <mark3>friend.</mark3><br>
<br>
Not that we love <mark3>death,</mark3><br>
Not truly, not the fluttering <mark3>breath,</mark3><br>
The obscene shudder of the finished <mark5>act--</mark5><br>
What the doe feels when the ultimate <mark3>fact</mark3><br>
Tears at her bowels with its <mark3>jaws.</mark3><br>
<br>
Our taste is for the opulent <mark3>pause</mark3><br>
Before the end comes. If the end is <mark4>certain</mark4><br>
All of us are players at the final <mark3>curtain:</mark3><br>
All of us, silence for a time <mark4>deferred,</mark4><br>
Find time before us for one sad last <mark3>word.</mark3><br>
Victim, rebel, convert, <mark3>stoic--</mark3><br>
Every role but the <mark3>heroic--</mark3><br>
We turn our tragic faces to the <mark4>stalls</mark4><br>
To wince our moment till the curtain <mark3>falls.</mark3><br>
<br>
A world ends when its metaphor has <mark4>died.</mark4><br>
An age becomes an age, all else <mark3>beside,</mark3><br>
<br>
When sensuous poets in their pride <mark4>invent</mark4><br>
Emblems for the soul's <mark3>consent</mark3><br>
That speak the meanings men will never <mark3>know</mark3><br>
But man-imagined images can <mark3>show:</mark3><br>
It perishes when those images, though <mark4>seen,</mark4><br>
No longer <mark3>mean.</mark3><br>
A world was ended when the <mark3>womb</mark3><br>
<br>
Where girl held God became the <mark3>tomb</mark3><br>
Where God lies buried in a <mark4>man:</mark4><br>
Botticelli's image neither speaks nor <mark3>can</mark3><br>
To our kind. His star-guided <mark3>stranger</mark3><br>
Teaches no longer, by the child, the <mark3>manger,</mark3><br>
The meaning of the beckoning <mark4>skies.</mark4><br>
<mark4>Sophocles</mark4>, when his reverent actors <mark3>rise</mark3><br>
To play the king with bleeding <mark3>eyes,</mark3><br>
<br>
No longer shows us on the stage <mark3>advance</mark3><br>
God's purpose in the terrible fatality of <mark3>chance.</mark3><br>
No woman living, when the girl and <mark4>swan</mark4><br>
Embrace in verses, feels <mark3>upon</mark3><br>
<br>
Her breast the awful thunder of that <mark4>breast</mark4><br>
Where God, made <mark4>beast</mark4>, is by the blood <mark3>confessed.</mark3><br>
Empty as conch shell by the waters <mark4>cast</mark4><br>
The metaphor still sounds but cannot <mark3>tell,</mark3><br>
<br>
And we, like parasite crabs, put on the <mark3>shell</mark3><br>
And drag it at the sea's edge up and <mark4>down.</mark4><br>
This is the destiny we say we <mark4>own.</mark4><br>
But are we <mark4>sure</mark4><br>
<br>
The age that dies upon its <mark4>metaphor</mark4><br>
<br>
Among these Roman <mark4>heads</mark4>, these mediaeval <mark4>towers,</mark4><br>
Is <mark3>ours?--</mark3><br>
Or ours the ending of that <mark5>story?</mark5><br>
The meanings in a man that <mark3>quarry</mark3><br>
Images from blinded <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
And white birds and the turning <mark1>skies</mark1><br>
To make a world of were not spent with <mark4>these</mark4><br>
Abandoned <mark4>presences.</mark4><br>
The journey of our history has not <mark4>ceased:</mark4><br>
Earth turns us still toward the rising <mark3>east,</mark3><br>
The metaphor still struggles in the <mark3>stone,</mark3><br>
<br>
The allegory of the flesh and <mark3>bone</mark3><br>
Still stares into the summer <mark4>grass</mark4><br>
That is its <mark3>glass,</mark3><br>
The ignorant <mark4>blood</mark4><br>
Still knocks at silence to be <mark4>understood.</mark4><br>
Poets, deserted by the world <mark4>before,</mark4><br>
Turn round into the actual <mark4>air:</mark4><br>
Invent the age! Invent the <mark1>metaphor!</mark1><br>
