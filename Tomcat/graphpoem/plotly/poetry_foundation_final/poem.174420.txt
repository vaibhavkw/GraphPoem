Title : Astrophil and Stella 3: Let dainty wits cry on the sisters nine <br>
Author : Sir Philip Sidney <br><br>

Let dainty wits cry on the sisters <mark3>nine,</mark3><br>
That, bravely mask'd, their fancies may be <mark3>told;</mark3><br>
Or, Pindar's apes, flaunt they in phrases <mark3>fine,</mark3><br>
Enam'ling with pied flowers their thoughts of <mark3>gold.</mark3><br>
Or else let them in statelier glory <mark3>shine,</mark3><br>
Ennobling newfound tropes with problems <mark3>old;</mark3><br>
Or with strange similes enrich each <mark3>line,</mark3><br>
Of herbs or beasts which Ind or Afric <mark3>hold.</mark3><br>
For me, in sooth, no Muse but one I <mark3>know;</mark3><br>
Phrases and problems from my reach do <mark3>grow,</mark3><br>
And strange things cost too dear for my poor sprites. <br>
How then? even thus: in Stella's face I <mark4>read</mark4><br>
What love and beauty be; then all my <mark3>deed</mark3><br>
But copying is, what in her Nature writes.<br>
