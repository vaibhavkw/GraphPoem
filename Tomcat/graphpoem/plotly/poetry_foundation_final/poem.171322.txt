Title : The History of America <br>

--for Paul Metcalf<br>
A linear projection: a route. It <mark4>crosses</mark4><br>
The ocean in many ships. Arriving in the new   <br>
Land, it cuts through and down forests and <mark4>it</mark4><br>
Keeps moving. Terrain: Rock, <mark4>weaponry.</mark4><br>
Dark trees, mastery. Grass, to yield. Earth,   <br>
Reproachful. Fox, bear, coon, <mark4>wildcat</mark4><br>
Prowl gloomily, it kills <mark1>them</mark1>, it skins <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
Its language alters, no account varmint, <mark4>its</mark4><br>
Teeth set, nothing defeats its obsession, it <mark4>becomes</mark4><br>
A snake in the reedy river. Spits and <mark4>prays,</mark4><br>
Keeps moving. Behind it, a steel track. <mark4>Cold,</mark4><br>
Permanent. Not permanent. It will decay. <mark4>This</mark4><br>
Does not matter, it does not actually <mark4>care,</mark4><br>
Murdering the buffalo, driving the laggard <mark4>regiments,</mark4><br>
The caring was a necessary myth, an eagle like   <br>
A speck in heaven <mark4>dives</mark4>, The line <mark4>believes</mark4><br>
That the entire wrinkled mountain range is <mark4>the</mark4><br>
Eagle's nest, and everything tumbles in <mark4>place.</mark4><br>
It buries its balls at Wounded Knee, it <mark4>rushes</mark4><br>
Gold, it gambles. It buys plastics. <mark4>Another</mark4><br>
Ocean stops it. Soon, soon, up by its <mark4>roots,</mark4><br>
Severed, irrecoverably torn, that does not <mark4>matter,</mark4><br>
It decides, perpendicular from here: escape. <br>
<br>
A prior circle: a mouth. It is <mark4>nowhere,</mark4><br>
Everywhere, swollen, warm. Expanding and contracting   <br>
It absorbs and projects children, <mark4>jungles,</mark4><br>
Black shoes, pennies, blood. It <mark4>speaks</mark4><br>
Too many dark, suffering languages. Reaching a <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
Toward its throat, you disappear entirely. No <br>
Wonder you fear this bleeding pulse, no <mark4>wonder.</mark4><br>
