Title : A Forsaken Garden <br>
Author : Algernon Charles Swinburne <br><br>

In a coign of the cliff between lowland and <mark3>highland,</mark3><br>
At the sea-down's edge between windward and <mark3>lee,</mark3><br>
Walled round with rocks as an inland <mark3>island,</mark3><br>
The ghost of a garden fronts the <mark3>sea.</mark3><br>
A girdle of brushwood and thorn encloses <br>
The steep square slope of the blossomless <mark4>bed</mark4><br>
Where the weeds that grew green from the graves of its <mark4>roses</mark4><br>
Now lie <mark3>dead.</mark3><br>
<br>
The fields fall southward, abrupt and <mark3>broken,</mark3><br>
To the low last edge of the long lone <mark4>land.</mark4><br>
If a step should sound or a word be <mark3>spoken,</mark3><br>
Would a ghost not rise at the strange guest's <mark3>hand?</mark3><br>
So long have the grey bare walks lain guestless, <br>
Through branches and briars if a man make <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
He shall find no life but the sea-wind's, restless <br>
Night and <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
<br>
The dense hard passage is blind and <mark4>stifled</mark4><br>
That crawls by a track none turn to <mark3>climb</mark3><br>
To the strait waste place that the years have <mark3>rifled</mark3><br>
Of all but the thorns that are touched not of <mark3>time.</mark3><br>
The thorns he spares when the rose is <mark4>taken;</mark4><br>
The rocks are left when he wastes the <mark4>plain.</mark4><br>
The wind that wanders, the weeds <mark4>wind-shaken,</mark4><br>
These <mark4>remain.</mark4><br>
<br>
Not a flower to be pressed of the foot that falls <mark1>not;</mark1><br>
As the heart of a dead man the seed-plots are <mark3>dry;</mark3><br>
From the thicket of thorns whence the nightingale calls <mark1>not,</mark1><br>
Could she call, there were never a rose to <mark3>reply.</mark3><br>
Over the meadows that blossom and <mark3>wither</mark3><br>
Rings but the note of a sea-bird's <mark3>song;</mark3><br>
Only the sun and the rain come <mark3>hither</mark3><br>
All year <mark3>long.</mark3><br>
<br>
The sun burns sere and the rain dishevels <br>
One gaunt bleak blossom of scentless <mark3>breath.</mark3><br>
Only the wind here hovers and <mark4>revels</mark4><br>
In a round where life seems barren as <mark3>death.</mark3><br>
Here there was laughing of old, there was <mark4>weeping,</mark4><br>
Haply, of lovers none ever will <mark3>know,</mark3><br>
Whose eyes went seaward a hundred <mark3>sleeping</mark3><br>
Years <mark3>ago.</mark3><br>
<br>
Heart handfast in heart as they stood, "Look thither," <br>
Did he whisper? "look forth from the flowers to the <mark1>sea;</mark1><br>
For the foam-flowers endure when the rose-blossoms <mark1>wither,</mark1><br>
And men that love lightly may die--but <mark3>we?"</mark3><br>
And the same wind sang and the same waves <mark5>whitened,</mark5><br>
And or ever the garden's last petals were <mark4>shed,</mark4><br>
In the lips that had <mark4>whispered</mark4>, the eyes that had <mark4>lightened,</mark4><br>
Love was <mark1>dead.</mark1><br>
<br>
Or they loved their life through, and then went <mark2>whither?</mark2><br>
And were one to the end--but what end who <mark4>knows?</mark4><br>
Love deep as the sea as a rose must <mark1>wither,</mark1><br>
As the rose-red seaweed that mocks the <mark3>rose.</mark3><br>
Shall the dead take thought for the dead to love <mark4>them?</mark4><br>
What love was ever as deep as a <mark3>grave?</mark3><br>
They are loveless now as the grass above <mark1>them</mark1><br>
Or the <mark3>wave.</mark3><br>
<br>
All are at one now, roses and <mark4>lovers,</mark4><br>
Not known of the cliffs and the fields and the <mark1>sea.</mark1><br>
Not a breath of the time that has been <mark3>hovers</mark3><br>
In the air now soft with a summer to <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
Not a breath shall there sweeten the seasons <mark4>hereafter</mark4><br>
Of the flowers or the lovers that laugh now or <mark5>weep,</mark5><br>
When as they that are free now of weeping and <mark3>laughter</mark3><br>
We shall <mark3>sleep.</mark3><br>
<br>
Here death may deal not again for <mark4>ever;</mark4><br>
Here change may come not till all change <mark4>end.</mark4><br>
From the graves they have made they shall rise up <mark3>never,</mark3><br>
       Who have left nought living to ravage and rend. <br>
Earth, stones, and thorns of the wild ground <mark4>growing,</mark4><br>
While the sun and the rain live, these shall <mark1>be;</mark1><br>
Till a last wind's breath upon all these <mark3>blowing</mark3><br>
Roll the <mark1>sea.</mark1><br>
<br>
Till the slow sea rise and the sheer cliff <mark3>crumble,</mark3><br>
Till terrace and meadow the deep gulfs <mark3>drink,</mark3><br>
Till the strength of the waves of the high tides <mark3>humble</mark3><br>
The fields that lessen, the rocks that <mark3>shrink,</mark3><br>
Here now in his triumph where all things <mark4>falter,</mark4><br>
Stretched out on the spoils that his own hand <mark4>spread,</mark4><br>
As a god self-slain on his own strange <mark3>altar,</mark3><br>
Death lies <mark1>dead.</mark1><br>
