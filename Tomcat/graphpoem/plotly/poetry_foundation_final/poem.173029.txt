Title : Prospice <br>
Author : Robert Browning <br><br>

Fear death??to feel the fog in my <mark3>throat,</mark3><br>
The mist in my <mark3>face,</mark3><br>
When the snows begin, and the blasts <mark3>denote</mark3><br>
I am nearing the <mark3>place,</mark3><br>
The power of the night, the press of the <mark3>storm,</mark3><br>
The post of the <mark3>foe;</mark3><br>
Where he stands, the Arch Fear in a visible <mark3>form,</mark3><br>
Yet the strong man must <mark3>go:</mark3><br>
For the journey is done and the summit <mark3>attained,</mark3><br>
And the barriers <mark3>fall,</mark3><br>
Though a battle's to fight ere the guerdon be <mark3>gained,</mark3><br>
The reward of it <mark3>all.</mark3><br>
I was ever a fighter, so?one fight more,<br>
The best and the <mark4>last!</mark4><br>
I would hate that death bandaged my eyes and <mark5>forbore,</mark5><br>
And bade me creep <mark3>past.</mark3><br>
No! let me taste the whole of it, fare like my <mark3>peers</mark3><br>
The heroes of <mark4>old,</mark4><br>
Bear the brunt, in a minute pay glad life's <mark3>arrears</mark3><br>
Of pain, darkness and <mark3>cold.</mark3><br>
For sudden the worst turns the best to the <mark3>brave,</mark3><br>
The black minute's at <mark4>end,</mark4><br>
And the elements' rage, the fiend-voices that <mark3>rave,</mark3><br>
Shall dwindle, shall <mark3>blend,</mark3><br>
Shall change, shall become first a peace out of <mark3>pain,</mark3><br>
Then a <mark4>light</mark4>, then thy <mark4>breast,</mark4><br>
O thou soul of my soul! I shall clasp thee <mark3>again,</mark3><br>
And with God be the <mark3>rest!</mark3><br>
