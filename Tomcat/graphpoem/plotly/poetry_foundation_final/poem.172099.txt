Title : Arise, Go Down <br>
Author : Li-Young Lee <br><br>

It wasn't the bright hems of the Lord's skirts   <br>
that brushed my face and I opened my <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
to see from a cleft in rock His <mark4>backside;</mark4><br>
<br>
it's a wasp perched on my left cheek. I keep   <br>
my eyes closed and stand perfectly still   <br>
in the garden till it leaves me <mark4>alone,</mark4><br>
<br>
not to contemplate how this century   <br>
ends and the next begins with no <mark4>one</mark4><br>
I know having seen God, but to <mark4>wonder</mark4><br>
<br>
why I get through most days unscathed, though I   <br>
live in a time when it might be <mark4>otherwise,</mark4><br>
and I grow more fatherless each day. <br>
<br>
For years now I have come to <mark4>conclusions</mark4><br>
without my father's help, <mark4>discovering</mark4><br>
on my own what I <mark1>know</mark1>, what I don't <mark1>know,</mark1><br>
<br>
and seeing how one cancels the <mark4>other.</mark4><br>
I've become a scholar of <mark4>cancellations.</mark4><br>
Here, I stand among my father's <mark4>roses</mark4><br>
<br>
and see that what punctures outnumbers <mark4>what</mark4><br>
consoles, the cruel and the tender <mark4>never</mark4><br>
make peace, though one <mark4>climbs</mark4>, though one <mark4>descends</mark4><br>
<br>
petal by petal to the hidden <mark4>ground</mark4><br>
no one owns. I see that which is <mark4>taken</mark4><br>
away by violence or <mark4>persuasion.</mark4><br>
<br>
The rose announces on earth the <mark4>kingdom</mark4><br>
of gravity. A bird cancels <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
My eyelids cancel the bird. <mark4>Anything</mark4><br>
<br>
might cancel my eyes: distance, time, war.   <br>
My father said, Never take your both <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
off of the world, before he rocked <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
<br>
All night we waited for the <mark5>knock</mark5><br>
that would have signalled, All clear, come now;   <br>
it would have meant escape; it never <mark4>came.</mark4><br>
<br>
I didn't make the world I leave you <mark4>with,</mark4><br>
he said, and then, being poor, he left <mark1>me</mark1><br>
only this world, in which there is <mark4>always</mark4><br>
<br>
a family waiting in <mark4>terror</mark4><br>
before they're rended, this world wherein a <mark4>man</mark4><br>
might arise, go down, and walk along a <mark4>path</mark4><br>
<br>
and pause and bow to <mark1>roses</mark1>, <mark1>roses</mark1><br>
his father raised, and admire them, for one <mark4>moment</mark4><br>
unable, thank <mark4>God</mark4>, to see in each <mark4>and</mark4><br>
every flower the world cancelling itself. <br>
