Title : Song: Fair Iris I love and hourly I die <br>
Author : John Dryden <br><br>

from Amphitryon<br>
Fair Iris I love and hourly I <mark3>die,</mark3><br>
But not for a lip nor a languishing <mark3>eye:</mark3><br>
She's fickle and false, and there I <mark3>agree;</mark3><br>
For I am as false and as fickle as <mark3>she:</mark3><br>
We neither believe what either can <mark3>say;</mark3><br>
And, neither believing, we neither <mark3>betray.</mark3><br>
<br>
'Tis civil to swear and say things, of <mark4>course;</mark4><br>
We mean not the taking for better or <mark4>worse.</mark4><br>
When present we love, when absent <mark1>agree;</mark1><br>
I think not of Iris, nor Iris of <mark3>me:</mark3><br>
The legend of love no couple can find <br>
So easy to part, or so equally join'd.<br>
