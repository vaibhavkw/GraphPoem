Title : Up at a Villa?Down in the City <br>
Author : Robert Browning <br><br>

(As Distinguished by an Italian Person of <mark4>Quality)</mark4><br>
Had I but plenty of money, money enough and to <mark3>spare,</mark3><br>
The house for me, no doubt, were a house in the <mark3>city-square;</mark3><br>
Ah, such a life, such a life, as one leads at the window <mark3>there!</mark3><br>
<br>
Something to see, by Bacchus, something to hear, at <mark3>least!</mark3><br>
There, the whole day long, one's life is a perfect <mark3>feast;</mark3><br>
While up at a villa one lives, I maintain <mark4>it</mark4>, no more than a <mark3>beast.</mark3><br>
<br>
Well now, look at our villa! stuck like the horn of a <mark4>bull</mark4><br>
Just on a mountain-edge as bare as the creature's <mark4>skull,</mark4><br>
Save a mere shag of a bush with hardly a leaf to <mark4>pull!</mark4><br>
?I scratch my own, sometimes, to see if the hair's turned <mark3>wool.</mark3><br>
<br>
But the city, oh the city?the square with the houses! <mark3>Why?</mark3><br>
They are stone-faced, white as a curd, there's something to take the <mark3>eye!</mark3><br>
Houses in four straight lines, not a single front <mark3>awry;</mark3><br>
You watch who crosses and gossips, who saunters, who hurries <mark3>by;</mark3><br>
Green blinds, as a matter of course, to draw when the sun gets <mark3>high;</mark3><br>
And the shops with fanciful signs which are painted <mark4>properly.</mark4><br>
<br>
What of a villa? Though winter be over in March by <mark3>rights,</mark3><br>
'Tis May perhaps ere the snow shall have withered well off the <mark3>heights:</mark3><br>
You've the brown ploughed land before, where the oxen steam and <mark3>wheeze,</mark3><br>
And the hills over-smoked behind by the faint gray <mark3>olive-trees.</mark3><br>
<br>
Is it better in May, I ask you? You've summer all at <mark4>once;</mark4><br>
In a day he leaps complete with a few strong April <mark4>suns.</mark4><br>
'Mid the sharp short emerald wheat, scarce risen three fingers <mark4>well,</mark4><br>
The wild tulip, at end of its tube, blows out its great red <mark3>bell</mark3><br>
Like a thin clear bubble of blood, for the children to pick and <mark3>sell.</mark3><br>
<br>
Is it ever hot in the square? There's a fountain to spout and <mark3>splash!</mark3><br>
In the shade it sings and springs: in the shine such foambows <mark3>flash</mark3><br>
On the horses with curling fish-tails, that prance and paddle and <mark3>pash</mark3><br>
Round the lady atop in her conch?fifty gazers do not <mark3>abash,</mark3><br>
Though all that she wears is some weeds round her waist in a sort of <mark3>sash.</mark3><br>
<br>
All the year long at the villa, nothing to see though you <mark4>linger,</mark4><br>
Except yon cypress that points like death's lean lifted <mark4>forefinger.</mark4><br>
Some think fireflies pretty, when they mix in the corn and <mark4>mingle,</mark4><br>
Or thrid the stinking hemp till the stalks of it seem <mark3>a-tingle.</mark3><br>
Late August or early September, the stunning cicala is <mark4>shrill,</mark4><br>
And the bees keep their tiresome whine round the resinous firs on the <mark3>hill.</mark3><br>
Enough of the seasons,?I spare you the months of the fever and <mark3>chill.</mark3><br>
<br>
Ere you open your eyes in the city, the blessed church-bells <mark3>begin:</mark3><br>
No sooner the bells leave off than the diligence rattles <mark3>in:</mark3><br>
You get the pick of the news, and it costs you never a <mark3>pin.</mark3><br>
By and by there's the travelling doctor gives pills, lets blood, draws <mark3>teeth;</mark3><br>
Or the Pulcinello-trumpet breaks up the market <mark3>beneath.</mark3><br>
At the post-office such a scene-picture?the new play, piping <mark4>hot!</mark4><br>
And a notice how, only this morning, three liberal thieves were <mark3>shot.</mark3><br>
<br>
Above it, behold the Archbishop's most fatherly of <mark4>rebukes,</mark4><br>
And beneath, with his crown and his lion, some little new law of the <mark3>Duke's!</mark3><br>
Or a sonnet with flowery marge, to the Reverend Don So-and so,<br>
Who is Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarca, Saint Jerome and Cicero,<br>
"And moreover," (the sonnet goes rhyming,) "the skirts of Saint Paul has <mark4>reached,</mark4><br>
Having preached us those six Lent-lectures more unctuous than ever he <mark3>preached."</mark3><br>
Noon strikes,?here sweeps the procession! our Lady borne smiling and <mark4>smart</mark4><br>
With a pink gauze gown all spangles, and seven swords stuck in her <mark3>heart!</mark3><br>
Bang-whang-whang goes the drum, tootle-te-tootle the <mark3>fife.</mark3><br>
No keeping one's haunches still: it's the greatest pleasure in <mark3>life.</mark3><br>
<br>
But bless you, it's dear?it's dear! fowls, wine, at double the <mark4>rate.</mark4><br>
They have clapped a new tax upon <mark4>salt</mark4>, and what oil pays passing the <mark3>gate</mark3><br>
It's a horror to think of. And so, the villa for me, not the <mark4>city!</mark4><br>
Beggars can scarcely be choosers: but still?ah, the <mark1>pity</mark1>, the <mark3>pity!</mark3><br>
Look, two and two go the priests, then the monks with cowls and <mark4>sandals,</mark4><br>
And the penitents dressed in white shirts a-holding the yellow <mark3>candles;</mark3><br>
One, he carries a flag up straight, and another a cross with <mark3>handles.</mark3><br>
And the Duke's guard brings up the rear, for the better prevention of <mark3>scandals:</mark3><br>
Bang-whang-whang goes the drum, tootle-te-tootle the <mark1>fife;</mark1><br>
Oh, a day in the city-square, there is no such pleasure in <mark1>life!</mark1><br>
