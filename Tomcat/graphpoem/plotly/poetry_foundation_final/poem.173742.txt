Title : Ode on a Grecian Urn <br>
Author : John Keats <br><br>

Thou still unravish'd bride of <mark4>quietness,</mark4><br>
Thou foster-child of silence and slow <mark3>time,</mark3><br>
Sylvan historian, who canst thus <mark4>express</mark4><br>
A flowery tale more sweetly than our <mark3>rhyme:</mark3><br>
What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy <mark3>shape</mark3><br>
Of deities or mortals, or of <mark4>both,</mark4><br>
               In Tempe or the dales of Arcady? <br>
What men or gods are these? What maidens <mark4>loth?</mark4><br>
What mad pursuit? What struggle to <mark3>escape?</mark3><br>
               What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy? <br>
<br>
Heard melodies are sweet, but those <mark4>unheard</mark4><br>
Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play <mark4>on;</mark4><br>
Not to the sensual ear, but, more <mark4>endear'd,</mark4><br>
Pipe to the spirit ditties of no <mark4>tone:</mark4><br>
Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not <mark3>leave</mark3><br>
Thy song, nor ever can those trees be <mark3>bare;</mark3><br>
Bold Lover, never, never canst thou <mark4>kiss,</mark4><br>
Though winning near the goal yet, do not <mark3>grieve;</mark3><br>
She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy <mark3>bliss,</mark3><br>
For ever wilt thou love, and she be <mark3>fair!</mark3><br>
<br>
Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot <mark4>shed</mark4><br>
Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring <mark3>adieu;</mark3><br>
And, happy melodist, unwearied, <br>
For ever piping songs for ever <mark3>new;</mark3><br>
More happy love! more happy, happy <mark4>love!</mark4><br>
For ever warm and still to be <mark4>enjoy'd,</mark4><br>
For ever <mark4>panting</mark4>, and for ever <mark4>young;</mark4><br>
All breathing human passion far <mark3>above,</mark3><br>
That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and <mark3>cloy'd,</mark3><br>
A burning forehead, and a parching <mark3>tongue.</mark3><br>
<br>
Who are these coming to the <mark4>sacrifice?</mark4><br>
To what green altar, O mysterious <mark4>priest,</mark4><br>
Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the <mark4>skies,</mark4><br>
         And all her silken flanks with garlands drest? <br>
What little town by river or sea <mark4>shore,</mark4><br>
Or mountain-built with peaceful <mark4>citadel,</mark4><br>
Is emptied of this folk, this pious <mark4>morn?</mark4><br>
And, little town, thy streets for <mark4>evermore</mark4><br>
Will silent be; and not a soul to <mark4>tell</mark4><br>
Why thou art desolate, can e'er <mark4>return.</mark4><br>
<br>
O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with <mark4>brede</mark4><br>
Of marble men and maidens <mark4>overwrought,</mark4><br>
With forest branches and the trodden <mark3>weed;</mark3><br>
Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of <mark3>thought</mark3><br>
As doth eternity: Cold <mark4>Pastoral!</mark4><br>
When old age shall this generation <mark4>waste,</mark4><br>
Thou shalt remain, in midst of other <mark3>woe</mark3><br>
Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou <mark4>say'st,</mark4><br>
"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,--that is <mark4>all</mark4><br>
Ye know on earth, and all ye need to <mark3>know."</mark3><br>
