Title : Fable of the Ant and the Word<br>
Author : Mary Barnard<br><br>

Ink-black, but moving <mark4>independently</mark4><br>
across the black and white parquet of print,   <br>
the ant cancels the author out. The page,   <br>
translated to itself, bears hair-like legs   <br>
disturbing the fine hairs of its fiber. <br>
These are the feet of summer, pillaging meaning,   <br>
destroying Alexandria. Sunlight is silence   <br>
laying waste all languages, until, <mark4>thinly,</mark4><br>
the fictional dialogue begins again:   <br>
the page goes on telling another <mark4>story.</mark4><br>
