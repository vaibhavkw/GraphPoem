Title : Fragment 3: Come, come thou bleak December wind <br>
Author : Samuel Taylor Coleridge <br><br>

Come, come thou bleak December wind,<br>
And blow the dry leaves from the <mark3>tree!</mark3><br>
Flash, like a Love-thought, thro' me, Death<br>
And take a Life that wearies <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
