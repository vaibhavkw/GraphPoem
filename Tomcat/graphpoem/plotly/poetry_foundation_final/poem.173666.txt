Title : The Starlight Night <br>
Author : Gerard Manley Hopkins <br><br>

Look at the stars! look, look up at the <mark3>skies!</mark3><br>
O look at all the fire-folk sitting in the <mark3>air!</mark3><br>
The bright boroughs, the circle-citadels <mark3>there!</mark3><br>
Down in dim woods the diamond delves! the <mark3>elves'-eyes!</mark3><br>
The grey lawns cold where gold, where quickgold <mark3>lies!</mark3><br>
Wind-beat whitebeam! airy abeles set on a <mark3>flare!</mark3><br>
Flake-doves sent floating forth at a farmyard <mark3>scare!</mark3><br>
Ah well! it is all a purchase, all is a <mark3>prize.</mark3><br>
<br>
Buy then! bid then! -- What? -- Prayer, patience, <mark4>alms</mark4>, <mark4>vows.</mark4><br>
Look, look: a May-mess, like on orchard <mark3>boughs!</mark3><br>
   Look! March-bloom, like on mealed-with-yellow sallows! <br>
These are indeed the barn; withindoors <mark3>house</mark3><br>
The <mark4>shocks</mark4>, This piece-bright paling shuts the <mark3>spouse</mark3><br>
Christ home, Christ and his mother and all his <mark4>hallows.</mark4><br>
