Title : Eleventh Song <br>
Author : Sir Philip Sidney <br><br>

"Who is it that this dark <mark3>night</mark3><br>
Underneath my window plaineth?"<br>
It is one who from thy <mark3>sight</mark3><br>
Being, ah, exil'd, disdaineth<br>
Every other vulgar <mark3>light.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Why, alas, and are you <mark3>he?</mark3><br>
Be not yet those fancies <mark3>changed?"</mark3><br>
Dear, when you find change in <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
Though from me you be <mark3>estranged,</mark3><br>
Let my change to ruin <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Well, in absence this will <mark3>die;</mark3><br>
Leave to see, and leave to <mark3>wonder."</mark3><br>
Absence sure will help, if <mark3>I</mark3><br>
Can learn how myself to <mark3>sunder</mark3><br>
From what in my heart doth <mark3>lie.</mark3><br>
<br>
"But time will these thoughts <mark3>remove;</mark3><br>
Time doth work what no man knoweth."<br>
Time doth as the subject <mark3>prove;</mark3><br>
With time still the affection groweth<br>
In the faithful <mark4>turtle-dove.</mark4><br>
<br>
"What if you new beauties <mark3>see?</mark3><br>
Will not they stir new <mark3>affection?"</mark3><br>
I will think they pictures <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
Image-like, of saints' <mark3>perfection,</mark3><br>
Poorly counterfeiting <mark3>thee.</mark3><br>
<br>
"But your reason's purest <mark1>light</mark1><br>
Bids you leave such minds to <mark3>nourish."</mark3><br>
Dear, do reason no such <mark3>spite;</mark3><br>
Never doth thy beauty <mark3>flourish</mark3><br>
More than in my reason's <mark1>sight.</mark1><br>
<br>
"But the wrongs love bears will <mark3>make</mark3><br>
Love at length leave <mark4>undertaking."</mark4><br>
No, the more fools it do <mark3>shake,</mark3><br>
In a ground of so firm <mark4>making</mark4><br>
Deeper still they drive the <mark3>stake.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Peace, I think that some give <mark4>ear!</mark4><br>
Come no more, lest I get <mark4>anger!"</mark4><br>
Bliss, I will my bliss forbear;<br>
Fearing, sweet, you to <mark4>endanger;</mark4><br>
But my soul shall harbour <mark4>there.</mark4><br>
<br>
"Well, begone; begone, I <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
Lest that Argus' eyes perceive <mark1>you!"</mark1><br>
Oh, unjust Fortune's <mark3>sway,</mark3><br>
Which can make me thus to leave <mark1>you;</mark1><br>
And from louts to run <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
