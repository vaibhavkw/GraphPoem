Title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 72 <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

Risest thou thus, dim <mark4>dawn</mark4>, <mark4>again,</mark4><br>
And howlest, issuing out of <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
With blasts that blow the poplar <mark3>white,</mark3><br>
And lash with storm the streaming <mark3>pane?</mark3><br>
<br>
Day, when my crown'd estate <mark4>begun</mark4><br>
To pine in that reverse of <mark3>doom,</mark3><br>
Which sicken'd every living <mark3>bloom,</mark3><br>
And blurr'd the splendour of the <mark3>sun;</mark3><br>
<br>
Who usherest in the dolorous <mark3>hour</mark3><br>
With thy quick tears that make the <mark3>rose</mark3><br>
Pull <mark4>sideways</mark4>, and the daisy <mark3>close</mark3><br>
Her crimson fringes to the <mark3>shower;</mark3><br>
<br>
Who might'st have heaved a windless <mark4>flame</mark4><br>
Up the deep East, or, whispering, <mark4>play'd</mark4><br>
A chequer-work of beam and <mark4>shade</mark4><br>
Along the hills, yet look'd the <mark3>same.</mark3><br>
<br>
As wan, as chill, as wild as <mark3>now;</mark3><br>
Day, mark'd as with some hideous <mark4>crime,</mark4><br>
When the dark hand struck down thro' <mark3>time,</mark3><br>
And cancell'd nature's best: but <mark3>thou,</mark3><br>
<br>
Lift as thou may'st thy burthen'd <mark4>brows</mark4><br>
Thro' clouds that drench the morning <mark4>star,</mark4><br>
And whirl the ungarner'd sheaf <mark3>afar,</mark3><br>
And sow the sky with flying <mark3>boughs,</mark3><br>
<br>
And up thy vault with roaring <mark4>sound</mark4><br>
Climb thy thick noon, disastrous <mark3>day;</mark3><br>
Touch thy dull goal of joyless <mark3>gray,</mark3><br>
And hide thy shame beneath the <mark3>ground.</mark3><br>
