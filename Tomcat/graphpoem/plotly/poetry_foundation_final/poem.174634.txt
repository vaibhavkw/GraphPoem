Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

A Monodrama<br>
Come into the garden, <mark1>Maud,</mark1><br>
For the black bat, night, has <mark3>flown,</mark3><br>
Come into the garden, <mark1>Maud,</mark1><br>
I am here at the gate <mark3>alone;</mark3><br>
And the woodbine spices are wafted <mark3>abroad,</mark3><br>
And the musk of the rose is <mark3>blown.</mark3><br>
<br>
For a breeze of morning <mark4>moves,</mark4><br>
And the planet of Love is on <mark3>high,</mark3><br>
Beginning to faint in the light that she <mark4>loves</mark4><br>
In a bed of daffodil <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
To faint in the light of the sun she <mark1>loves,</mark1><br>
To faint in his light, and to <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
<br>
All night have the roses <mark4>heard</mark4><br>
The flute, <mark4>violin</mark4>, <mark4>bassoon;</mark4><br>
All night has the casement jessamine stirr'd <br>
To the dancers dancing in <mark3>tune;</mark3><br>
Till a silence fell with the waking <mark3>bird,</mark3><br>
And a hush with the setting <mark3>moon.</mark3><br>
<br>
I said to the lily, "There is but <mark4>one</mark4><br>
With whom she has heart to be <mark3>gay.</mark3><br>
When will the dancers leave her <mark1>alone?</mark1><br>
She is weary of dance and <mark3>play."</mark3><br>
Now half to the setting moon are <mark4>gone,</mark4><br>
And half to the rising <mark3>day;</mark3><br>
Low on the sand and loud on the <mark4>stone</mark4><br>
The last wheel echoes <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
<br>
I said to the <mark3>rose</mark3>, "The brief night <mark4>goes</mark4><br>
In babble and revel and <mark4>wine.</mark4><br>
O young lord-lover, what sighs are <mark3>those,</mark3><br>
For one that will never be <mark3>thine?</mark3><br>
But mine, but mine," so I sware to the <mark3>rose,</mark3><br>
"For ever and ever, <mark3>mine."</mark3><br>
<br>
And the soul of the rose went into my <mark4>blood,</mark4><br>
As the music clash'd in the <mark3>hall;</mark3><br>
And long by the garden lake I <mark4>stood,</mark4><br>
For I heard your rivulet <mark3>fall</mark3><br>
From the lake to the meadow and on to the <mark3>wood,</mark3><br>
Our wood, that is dearer than <mark3>all;</mark3><br>
<br>
From the meadow your walks have left so <mark3>sweet</mark3><br>
That whenever a March-wind <mark4>sighs</mark4><br>
He sets the jewel-print of your <mark3>feet</mark3><br>
In violets blue as your <mark3>eyes,</mark3><br>
To the woody hollows in which we <mark3>meet</mark3><br>
      And the valleys of Paradise. <br>
<br>
The slender acacia would not <mark3>shake</mark3><br>
One long milk-bloom on the <mark3>tree;</mark3><br>
The white lake-blossom fell into the <mark3>lake</mark3><br>
As the pimpernel dozed on the <mark3>lea;</mark3><br>
But the rose was awake all night for your <mark3>sake,</mark3><br>
Knowing your promise to <mark3>me;</mark3><br>
The lilies and roses were all <mark3>awake,</mark3><br>
They sigh'd for the dawn and <mark3>thee.</mark3><br>
<br>
Queen rose of the rosebud garden of <mark4>girls,</mark4><br>
Come hither, the dances are <mark4>done,</mark4><br>
In gloss of satin and glimmer of <mark3>pearls,</mark3><br>
Queen lily and rose in <mark1>one;</mark1><br>
Shine out, little head, sunning over with <mark3>curls,</mark3><br>
To the flowers, and be their <mark3>sun.</mark3><br>
<br>
There has fallen a splendid <mark3>tear</mark3><br>
From the passion-flower at the <mark4>gate.</mark4><br>
She is coming, my dove, my <mark3>dear;</mark3><br>
She is coming, my life, my <mark3>fate;</mark3><br>
The red rose cries, "She is <mark1>near</mark1>, she is <mark3>near;"</mark3><br>
And the white rose weeps, "She is <mark3>late;"</mark3><br>
The larkspur listens, "I <mark1>hear</mark1>, I <mark4>hear;"</mark4><br>
And the lily whispers, "I <mark3>wait."</mark3><br>
<br>
She is coming, my own, my <mark1>sweet;</mark1><br>
Were it ever so airy a <mark4>tread,</mark4><br>
My heart would hear her and <mark3>beat,</mark3><br>
Were it earth in an earthy <mark3>bed;</mark3><br>
My dust would hear her and <mark1>beat,</mark1><br>
Had I lain for a century <mark3>dead,</mark3><br>
Would start and tremble under her <mark1>feet,</mark1><br>
And blossom in purple and <mark3>red.</mark3><br>
