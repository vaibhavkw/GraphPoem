Title : The Life of Lincoln West <br>
Author : Gwendolyn Brooks <br><br>

Ugliest little boy <br>
that everyone ever saw.   <br>
That is what everyone <mark4>said.</mark4><br>
<br>
Even to his mother it was <mark4>apparent--</mark4><br>
when the blue-aproned nurse came into <mark4>the</mark4><br>
northeast end of the maternity <mark4>ward</mark4><br>
bearing his squeals and plump <mark4>bottom</mark4><br>
looped up in a scant receiving <mark4>blanket,</mark4><br>
bending, to pass the bundle <mark4>carefully</mark4><br>
into the waiting mother-hands--that <mark4>this</mark4><br>
was no cute little ugliness, no sly baby waywardness   <br>
that was going to inch <mark3>away</mark3><br>
as would baby fat, baby curl, <mark4>and</mark4><br>
baby spot-rash. The pendulous lip, <mark1>the</mark1><br>
branching ears, the eyes so wide and <mark4>wild,</mark4><br>
the vague unvibrant brown of the <mark4>skin,</mark4><br>
and, most disturbing, the great <mark4>head.</mark4><br>
These components of That Look <mark5>bespoke</mark5><br>
the sure fibre. The deep <mark4>grain.</mark4><br>
<br>
His father could not bear the sight of <mark4>him.</mark4><br>
His mother high-piled her pretty dyed hair <mark1>and</mark1><br>
put him among her hairpins and <mark4>sweethearts,</mark4><br>
dance <mark4>slippers</mark4>, torn paper <mark4>roses.</mark4><br>
He was not less than <mark4>these,</mark4><br>
he was not <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
<br>
As the little Lincoln <mark3>grew,</mark3><br>
uglily upward and out, he <mark4>began</mark4><br>
to understand that something <mark4>was</mark4><br>
<mark4>wrong</mark4>, His little ways of <mark4>trying</mark4><br>
to please his father, the <mark4>bringing</mark4><br>
of matches, the jumping aside <mark4>at</mark4><br>
warning sound of oh-so-large <mark1>and</mark1><br>
rushing stride, the smile that <mark5>gave</mark5><br>
and gave and <mark5>gave--Unsuccessful!</mark5><br>
<br>
Even Christmases and Easters were <mark4>spoiled.</mark4><br>
He would be sitting at <mark1>the</mark1><br>
family feasting table, <mark4>really</mark4><br>
delighting in the displays of mashed <mark4>potatoes</mark4><br>
and the rich <mark4>golden</mark4><br>
fat-crust of the ham or the <mark4>festive</mark4><br>
fowl, when he would look up and <mark4>find</mark4><br>
somebody feeling indignant about <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
<br>
What a pity what a pity. No <mark4>love</mark4><br>
for one so loving. The little <mark4>Lincoln</mark4><br>
loved Everybody. Ants. The <mark4>changing</mark4><br>
<mark4>caterpillar</mark4>, His much-missing <mark4>mother.</mark4><br>
His kindergarten <mark4>teacher.</mark4><br>
<br>
His kindergarten <mark5>teacher--whose</mark5><br>
concern for him was composed of <mark4>one</mark4><br>
part sympathy and two parts repulsion. <br>
The others ran up with their little <mark4>drawings.</mark4><br>
He ran up with <mark4>his.</mark4><br>
<br>
tried to be as pleasant with him <mark4>as</mark4><br>
with others, but it was <mark4>difficult.</mark4><br>
For she was all pretty! all daintiness, <br>
all tiny vanilla, with blue eyes and <mark4>fluffy</mark4><br>
sun-hair. One afternoon <mark1>she</mark1><br>
saw him in the hall looking bleak <mark4>against</mark4><br>
the wall. It was strange because <mark1>the</mark1><br>
bell had long since rung and no <mark4>other</mark4><br>
child was in sight. Pity flooded <mark1>her.</mark1><br>
She buttoned her gloves and <mark4>suggested</mark4><br>
cheerfully that she walk him home. <mark1>She</mark1><br>
started out <mark4>bravely</mark4>, holding him by <mark1>the</mark1><br>
hand. But she had not walked far <mark3>before</mark3><br>
she regretted it. The little <mark4>monkey.</mark4><br>
Must everyone look? And clutching <mark1>her</mark1><br>
hand like that. . . . Literally <mark4>pinching</mark4><br>
it. . . <mark4>.</mark4><br>
<br>
At seven, the little Lincoln <mark4>loved</mark4><br>
the brother and sister <mark3>who</mark3><br>
moved next door. Handsome. <mark4>Well-</mark4><br>
dressed. Charitable, often, to him. <mark3>They</mark3><br>
enjoyed him because he <mark1>was</mark1><br>
resourceful, made <mark1>up</mark1><br>
games, told stories. But <mark4>when</mark4><br>
their More Acceptable friends came they <mark4>turned</mark4><br>
their handsome backs on him. <mark3>He</mark3><br>
hated himself for his <mark4>feeling</mark4><br>
of well-being when with them <mark4>despite--</mark4><br>
<br>
He spent much time looking at <mark5>himself</mark5><br>
in mirrors. What could be <mark4>done?</mark4><br>
But there was <mark1>no</mark1><br>
shrinking his head. There was <mark1>no</mark1><br>
binding his <mark4>ears.</mark4><br>
"Don't touch me!" cried the <mark4>little</mark4><br>
<br>
fairy-like being in the <mark4>playground.</mark4><br>
Her name was Nerissa. The <mark4>many</mark4><br>
<br>
children were playing tag, but <mark1>when</mark1><br>
he caught her, she recoiled, jerked <mark3>free</mark3><br>
and ran. It was like all <mark1>the</mark1><br>
rainbow that ever was, going <mark4>off</mark4><br>
forever, all, all the sparklings <mark3>in</mark3><br>
the sunset <mark4>west.</mark4><br>
One day, while he was yet <mark4>seven,</mark4><br>
<br>
a thing happened. In the down-town <mark4>movies</mark4><br>
with his mother a <mark4>white</mark4><br>
man in the seat beside him <mark4>whispered</mark4><br>
loudly to a companion, and pointed <mark1>at</mark1><br>
the little <mark5>Linc.</mark5><br>
"THERE! That's the kind I've been <mark4>wanting</mark4><br>
to show you! One of the <mark4>best</mark4><br>
examples of the specie. Not <mark4>like</mark4><br>
those diluted Negroes you see so much of <mark4>on</mark4><br>
the streets these days, but <mark1>the</mark1><br>
real <mark4>thing.</mark4><br>
Black, ugly, and odd. <mark3>You</mark3><br>
<br>
can see the savagery. The <mark4>blunt</mark4><br>
blankness. That is the <mark4>real</mark4><br>
His mother--her hair had never looked <mark3>so</mark3><br>
<br>
red around the dark <mark4>brown</mark4><br>
velvet of her face--jumped <mark1>up,</mark1><br>
shrieked "Go to--" She did not <mark5>finish.</mark5><br>
She yanked to his feet the <mark1>little</mark1><br>
Lincoln, who was sitting <mark4>there</mark4><br>
staring in fascination at his assessor. At the author of <mark1>his</mark1><br>
new <mark4>idea.</mark4><br>
All the way home he was happy. Of <mark4>course,</mark4><br>
he had not liked the <mark4>word</mark4><br>
<br>
But, after all, should he <mark4>not</mark4><br>
be used to that by now? What <mark4>had</mark4><br>
<br>
struck him, among words and <mark4>meanings</mark4><br>
he could little understand, was the <mark4>phrase</mark4><br>
"the real <mark1>thing."</mark1><br>
He didn't know quite why, <br>
but he liked <mark4>that.</mark4><br>
He liked that very <mark1>much.</mark1><br>
When he was hurt, too <mark1>much</mark1><br>
stared <mark1>at--</mark1><br>
<br>
too <mark1>much</mark1><br>
left alone--he <br>
thought about that. He told <mark1>himself</mark1><br>
"After all, <mark4>I'm</mark4><br>
the real <mark1>thing."</mark1><br>
It comforted <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
