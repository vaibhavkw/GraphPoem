Title : Inscription for a Fountain on a Heath <br>
Author : Samuel Taylor Coleridge <br><br>

This Sycamore, oft musical with <mark1>bees,--</mark1><br>
Such tents the Patriarchs loved! O long <mark4>unharmed</mark4><br>
May all its aged boughs o'er-canopy<br>
The small round <mark4>basin</mark4>, which this jutting <mark4>stone</mark4><br>
Keeps pure from falling leaves! Long may the Spring,<br>
Quietly as a sleeping infant's breath,<br>
Send up cold waters to the traveller<br>
With soft and even pulse! Nor ever <mark4>cease</mark4><br>
Yon tiny cone of sand its soundless <mark4>dance,</mark4><br>
Which at the bottom, like a Fairy's Page,<br>
As merry and no taller, dances still,<br>
Nor wrinkles the smooth surface of the Fount.<br>
Here Twilight is and Coolness: here is <mark4>moss,</mark4><br>
A soft seat, and a deep and ample <mark4>shade.</mark4><br>
Thou may'st toil far and find no second tree.<br>
Drink, Pilgrim, here; Here rest! and if thy heart<br>
Be innocent, here too shalt thou refresh<br>
Thy spirit, listening to some gentle <mark4>sound,</mark4><br>
Or passing gale or hum of murmuring <mark1>bees!</mark1><br>
