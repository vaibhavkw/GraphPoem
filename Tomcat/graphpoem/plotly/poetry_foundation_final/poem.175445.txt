Title : One With The Sun <br>
Author : A. F. Moritz <br><br>

<br>
one with the <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
in trackless <mark4>fields</mark4><br>
of yellow grass and thistle, <mark4>scent</mark4><br>
of humid heavy air and the wing <mark4>music</mark4><br>
of bees and <mark4>flies.</mark4><br>
<br>
Child, <mark4>slender</mark4><br>
nakedness to itself <mark4>unknown,</mark4><br>
true colour of the <mark4>light</mark4><br>
dispersed invisibly <br>
or glowing around the black <mark4>hulls</mark4><br>
of distant thunderheads, <mark4>around</mark4><br>
the grasshopper's <mark4>countenance,</mark4><br>
solemn, vigilant and <mark4>wise.</mark4><br>
<br>
Green apples, poured <mark4>full</mark4><br>
of density, of crispness, float <mark4>unmoved</mark4><br>
under leaves on the slope. <mark3>Brown</mark3><br>
fallen apples <mark4>nest</mark4><br>
in secret whorls of grass. The apple <mark1>tree:</mark1><br>
alone in so much space. And below <br>
in the woods by the <mark4>water</mark4><br>
a sweet dead branch <br>
cracks <mark5>lightly</mark5><br>
in the shadow in the <mark4>wind.</mark4><br>
<br>
But here is an old <mark4>track</mark4><br>
through the grass head-high <br>
to a child: <mark3>who</mark3><br>
made it? They must have <br>
passed and passed by this one <mark1>tree,</mark1><br>
by the abandoned, tireless <mark4>car</mark4><br>
where rabbits peer out, and the <mark4>circle</mark4><br>
of black <mark4>embers,</mark4><br>
cans, <mark4>springs</mark4>, <mark4>skeletons</mark4><br>
of furniture. They <mark3>too</mark3><br>
passed here many <mark4>times</mark4><br>
on their way from the street's <mark4>end</mark4><br>
to the oaks that <mark4>screen</mark4><br>
the river. <mark4>There</mark4><br>
the sun is nesting now, <mark4>night</mark4><br>
rises with pale flutterings <br>
of white wings from <mark4>roots</mark4><br>
of plants and the black <mark1>water.</mark1><br>
