Title : Astrophil and Stella 23: The curious wits, seeing dull pensiveness <br>
Author : Sir Philip Sidney <br><br>

The curious wits, seeing dull pensiveness <br>
Bewray itself in my long-settl'd <mark3>eyes,</mark3><br>
Whence those same fumes of melancholy <mark3>rise,</mark3><br>
With idle pains and missing aim do <mark3>guess.</mark3><br>
Some, that know how my spring I did <mark3>address,</mark3><br>
Deem that my Muse some fruit of knowledge <mark3>plies;</mark3><br>
<mark4>Others</mark4>, because the prince my service <mark3>tries,</mark3><br>
Think that I think state errors to <mark3>redress;</mark3><br>
But harder judges judge ambition's ragei <br>
Scourge of itself, still climbing slipp'ry placei <br>
Holds my young brain captiv'd in golden cage. <br>
O fool or over-wise! <mark4>alas</mark4>, the <mark4>race</mark4><br>
Of all my thoughts hath neither stop nor <mark3>start</mark3><br>
But only Stella's eyes and Stella's <mark3>heart.</mark3><br>
