Title : The Way to the River <br>
Author : W. S. Merwin <br><br>

The way to the river leads past the names of   <br>
Ash the sleeves the wreaths of <mark4>hinges</mark4><br>
Through the song of the bandage <mark3>vendor</mark3><br>
<br>
I lay your name by my <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
As I <mark3>go</mark3><br>
<br>
The way to the river leads past the late <br>
Doors and the games of the children born looking <mark4>backwards</mark4><br>
They play that they are broken <mark4>glass</mark4><br>
The numbers wait in the halls and the <mark4>clouds</mark4><br>
<br>
From <mark4>windows</mark4><br>
They play that they are old they are putting the <mark4>horizon</mark4><br>
Into baskets they are escaping they <mark3>are</mark3><br>
<br>
I step over the sleepers the fires the <mark4>calendars</mark4><br>
My voice turns to you <br>
I go past the juggler's condemned building the hollow   <br>
<br>
Windows <mark4>gallery</mark4><br>
Of invisible presidents the same motion in them <mark4>all</mark4><br>
In a parked cab by the sealed wall the hats are <mark4>playing</mark4><br>
Sort of poker with <mark4>somebody's</mark4><br>
Old snapshots game I don't understand they <mark4>lose</mark4><br>
<br>
The rivers <mark4>one</mark4><br>
After the other I begin to know where I <mark4>am</mark4><br>
I am <mark4>home</mark4><br>
Be here the flies from the house of the mapmaker   <br>
<br>
Walk on our letters I can <mark4>tell</mark4><br>
And the days hang medals between <mark4>us</mark4><br>
I have lit our room with a glove of yours <mark4>be</mark4><br>
Here I <mark4>turn</mark4><br>
To your name and the hour <mark4>remembers</mark4><br>
Its one word <br>
Be here what can <mark3>we</mark3><br>
<br>
Do for the dead the footsteps full of <mark4>money</mark4><br>
I offer you what I have my <br>
To the city of wires I have brought home a <mark4>handful</mark4><br>
Of water I walk <mark4>slowly</mark4><br>
<br>
In front of me they are building the <mark4>empty</mark4><br>
Ages I see them reflected not for <mark4>long</mark4><br>
Be here I am no longer ashamed of time it is too brief its <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
Have no <mark4>names</mark4><br>
I have passed it I <mark3>know</mark3><br>
         Oh Necessity you with the face you with   <br>
All the <mark4>faces</mark4><br>
This is written on the back of <mark4>everything</mark4><br>
<br>
But <mark1>we</mark1><br>
Will read it <mark3>together</mark3><br>
