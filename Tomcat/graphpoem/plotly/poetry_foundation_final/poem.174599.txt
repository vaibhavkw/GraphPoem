Title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 7 <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

Dark house, by which once more I <mark3>stand</mark3><br>
Here in the long unlovely <mark3>street,</mark3><br>
Doors, where my heart was used to <mark3>beat</mark3><br>
So quickly, waiting for a <mark3>hand,</mark3><br>
<br>
A hand that can be clasp'd no <mark3>more--</mark3><br>
Behold me, for I cannot <mark3>sleep,</mark3><br>
And like a guilty thing I <mark3>creep</mark3><br>
At earliest morning to the <mark3>door.</mark3><br>
<br>
He is not here; but far <mark3>away</mark3><br>
The noise of life begins <mark3>again,</mark3><br>
And ghastly thro' the drizzling <mark3>rain</mark3><br>
On the bald street breaks the blank <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
