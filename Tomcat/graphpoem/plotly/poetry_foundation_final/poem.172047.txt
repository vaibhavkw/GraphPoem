Title : Snow on the Desert <br>
Author : Agha Shahid Ali <br><br>

"Each ray of sunshine is seven minutes <mark4>old,"</mark4><br>
Serge told me in New York one December <mark4>night.</mark4><br>
<br>
"So when I look at the sky, I see the <mark4>past?"</mark4><br>
"Yes, Yes," he said. "especially on a clear <mark3>day."</mark3><br>
<br>
On January 19, 1987, <br>
as I very early in the <mark4>morning</mark4><br>
drove my sister to Tucson <mark4>International,</mark4><br>
<br>
suddenly on Alvernon and 22nd <mark4>Street</mark4><br>
the sliding doors of the fog were <mark4>opened,</mark4><br>
<br>
and the snow, which had fallen all night, now   <br>
sun-dazzled, blinded us, the earth whitened <br>
<br>
out, as if by cocaine, the desert's <mark4>plants,</mark4><br>
its mineral-hard colors <mark4>extinguished,</mark4><br>
wine frozen in the veins of the <mark4>cactus.</mark4><br>
<br>
*   *   <mark1>*</mark1><br>
<br>
The Desert Smells Like Rain: in it I <mark4>read:</mark4><br>
The syrup from which sacred wine is <mark4>made</mark4><br>
<br>
is extracted from the saguaros <mark1>each</mark1><br>
summer. The Papagos place it in <mark4>jars,</mark4><br>
<br>
where the last of it softens, then <mark5>darkens</mark5><br>
into a color of blood though it <mark4>tastes</mark4><br>
<br>
strangely sweet, almost white, like a dry <mark4>wine.</mark4><br>
As I tell Sameetah this, we are <mark4>still</mark4><br>
<br>
seven miles away. "And you know the <mark4>flowers</mark4><br>
of the saguaros bloom only at <mark1>night?"</mark1><br>
<br>
We are driving slowly, the road is <mark4>glass.</mark4><br>
"Imagine where we are was a sea <mark4>once.</mark4><br>
<br>
Just imagine!" The sky is <mark4>relentlessly</mark4><br>
sapphire, and the past is happening <mark4>quickly:</mark4><br>
<br>
the saguaros have opened themselves, <mark4>stretched</mark4><br>
out their arms to rays millions of years <mark1>old,</mark1><br>
<br>
in each ray a secret of the <mark4>planet's</mark4><br>
origin, the rays hurting each <mark1>cactus</mark1><br>
<br>
into <mark1>memory</mark1>, a human <mark4>memory</mark4><br>
for they are human, the Papagos <mark3>say:</mark3><br>
<br>
not only because they have arms and <mark4>veins</mark4><br>
and secrets. But because they too are a tribe, <br>
<br>
vulnerable to massacre. "It is <mark4>like</mark4><br>
the <mark4>end</mark4>, perhaps the beginning of the <mark4>world,"</mark4><br>
<br>
Sameetah says, staring at their <mark4>snow-sleeved</mark4><br>
arms. And we are driving by the <mark4>ocean</mark4><br>
<br>
that evaporated here, by its <mark4>shores,</mark4><br>
the past now happening so quickly that <mark1>each</mark1><br>
<br>
stoplight hurts us into memory, the sky   <br>
taking rapid notes on us as we <mark4>turn</mark4><br>
<br>
at Tucson Boulevard and drive into   <br>
the airport, and I realize that the <mark1>earth</mark1><br>
<br>
is thawing from longing into longing <mark4>and</mark4><br>
that we are being forgotten by those <mark4>arms.</mark4><br>
<br>
*   *   <mark1>*</mark1><br>
<br>
At the airport I stared after her <mark4>plane</mark4><br>
till the window <mark4>was</mark4><br>
<br>
                      again a mirror. <br>
As I drove back to the foothills, the fog <br>
<br>
shut its doors behind me on Alvernon,   <br>
and I breathed the dried <mark4>seas</mark4><br>
<br>
the earth had <mark4>lost,</mark4><br>
their forsaken shores. And I <mark4>remembered</mark4><br>
<br>
another moment that refers <mark4>only</mark4><br>
to itself: <br>
<br>
in New Delhi one <mark1>night</mark1><br>
as Begum Akhtar sang, the lights went <mark4>out.</mark4><br>
<br>
It was perhaps during the Bangladesh <mark4>War,</mark4><br>
perhaps there were <mark4>sirens,</mark4><br>
<br>
air-raid <mark4>warnings.</mark4><br>
But the audience, hushed, did not <mark5>stir.</mark5><br>
<br>
The microphone was dead, but she went <mark4>on</mark4><br>
singing, and her <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
<br>
was coming from <mark4>far</mark4><br>
away, as if she had already <mark4>died.</mark4><br>
<br>
And just before the lights did flood <mark3>her</mark3><br>
again, melting the <mark4>frost</mark4><br>
<br>
of her <mark4>diamond</mark4><br>
into rays, it was, like this turning <mark4>dark</mark4><br>
<br>
of fog, a moment when only a lost <mark5>sea</mark5><br>
can be heard, a time <br>
<br>
to <mark4>recollect</mark4><br>
every shadow, everything the earth was <mark4>losing,</mark4><br>
<br>
a time to think of everything the <mark1>earth</mark1><br>
and I had lost, of <mark4>all</mark4><br>
<br>
that I would <mark4>lose,</mark4><br>
of all that I was <mark1>losing.</mark1><br>
