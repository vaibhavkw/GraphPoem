Title : Flamingo Watching <br>
Author : Kay Ryan <br><br>

Wherever the flamingo <mark4>goes,</mark4><br>
she brings a city's worth <br>
of furbelows. She <mark4>seems</mark4><br>
unnatural by <mark4>nature--</mark4><br>
too vivid and <mark4>peculiar</mark4><br>
a structure to be pretty, <br>
and flexible to the <mark4>point</mark4><br>
of oddity. Perched on <br>
those <mark4>legs</mark4>, anything she <mark4>does</mark4><br>
seems like an act. Descending   <br>
on her egg or draping her head   <br>
along her back, <mark4>she's</mark4><br>
too exact and <mark4>sinuous</mark4><br>
to convince an <mark4>audience</mark4><br>
she's serious. The natural <mark4>elect,</mark4><br>
they <mark3>think</mark3>, would be less <mark3>pink,</mark3><br>
less able to relax their <mark4>necks,</mark4><br>
less flamboyant in <mark4>general.</mark4><br>
They privately expect that it's some   <br>
poorly jointed bland grey <mark4>animal</mark4><br>
with mitts for <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
whom God <mark4>protects.</mark4><br>
