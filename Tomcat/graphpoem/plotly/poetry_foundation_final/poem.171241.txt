Title : A Time Past <br>
Author : Denise Levertov <br><br>

The old wooden steps to the front door   <br>
where I was sitting that fall morning   <br>
when you came downstairs, just awake,   <br>
and my joy at sight of you (emerging   <br>
into golden day-- <br>
the dew almost <mark4>frost)</mark4><br>
pulled me to my feet to tell <mark1>you</mark1><br>
how much I loved <mark1>you:</mark1><br>
<br>
those wooden <mark4>steps</mark4><br>
are gone now, <mark4>decayed</mark4><br>
replaced with <mark4>granite,</mark4><br>
hard, gray, and <mark5>handsome.</mark5><br>
The old steps live <br>
only in me: <br>
my feet and <mark4>thighs</mark4><br>
remember them, and my <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
still feel their <mark4>splinters.</mark4><br>
<br>
Everything else about and around that <mark4>house</mark4><br>
brings memories of others--of marriage, <br>
of my son. And the steps do too: I recall <br>
sitting there with my friend and her little son who <mark4>died,</mark4><br>
or was it the second one who lives and <mark4>thrives?</mark4><br>
And sitting there 'in my life,' often, alone or with my <mark4>husband.</mark4><br>
Yet that one <mark4>instant,</mark4><br>
your cheerful, unafraid, youthful, 'I love you <mark3>too,'</mark3><br>
the quiet broken by no bird, no cricket, gold <mark4>leaves</mark4><br>
spinning in silence down <mark4>without</mark4><br>
any breeze to blow <mark4>them,</mark4><br>
                                    is what twines itself <br>
in my head and body across those slabs of <mark4>wood</mark4><br>
that were warm, ancient, and now <br>
wait somewhere to be <mark4>burnt.</mark4><br>
