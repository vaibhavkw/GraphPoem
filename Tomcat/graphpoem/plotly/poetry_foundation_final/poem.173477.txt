Title : Portrait of a Lady <br>
Author : T. S. Eliot <br><br>

Thou hast committed -- Fornication: but that was in another country, And besides, the wench is dead. (The Jew of <mark4>Malta)</mark4><br>
<br>
Among the smoke and fog of a December <mark4>afternoon</mark4><br>
You have the scene arrange itself -- as it will seem to <mark3>do--</mark3><br>
With "I have saved this afternoon for <mark3>you";</mark3><br>
And four wax candles in the darkened <mark3>room,</mark3><br>
Four rings of light upon the ceiling <mark3>overhead,</mark3><br>
An atmosphere of Juliet's <mark3>tomb</mark3><br>
Prepared for all the things to be <mark3>said</mark3>, or left <mark3>unsaid.</mark3><br>
We have been, let us say, to hear the latest <mark3>Pole</mark3><br>
Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and <mark4>finger-tips.</mark4><br>
"So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his <mark3>soul</mark3><br>
Should be resurrected only among <mark4>friends</mark4><br>
Some two or three, who will not touch the <mark3>bloom</mark3><br>
That is rubbed and questioned in the concert <mark1>room."</mark1><br>
--And so the conversation <mark4>slips</mark4><br>
Among velleities and carefully caught <mark4>regrets</mark4><br>
Through attenuated tones of <mark4>violins</mark4><br>
Mingled with remote <mark1>cornets</mark1><br>
And <mark3>begins.</mark3><br>
<br>
"You do not know how much they mean to me, my <mark1>friends,</mark1><br>
And how, how rare and strange it is, to <mark4>find</mark4><br>
In a life composed so much, so much of odds and <mark3>ends,</mark3><br>
(For indeed I do not love it ... you knew? you are not <mark3>blind!</mark3><br>
How keen you <mark4>are!)</mark4><br>
To find a friend who has these <mark4>qualities,</mark4><br>
Who <mark4>has</mark4>, and <mark4>gives</mark4><br>
Those qualities upon which friendship <mark3>lives.</mark3><br>
How much it means that I say this to you <mark1>--</mark1><br>
Without these friendships -- life, what cauchemar!" <br>
Among the winding of the <mark1>violins</mark1><br>
And the ariettes <br>
Of cracked <mark1>cornets</mark1><br>
Inside my brain a dull tom-tom <mark1>begins</mark1><br>
Absurdly hammering a prelude of its <mark4>own,</mark4><br>
Capricious <mark4>monotone</mark4><br>
That is at least one definite "false <mark4>note."</mark4><br>
-- Let us take the air, in a tobacco <mark4>trance,</mark4><br>
Admire the <mark4>monuments,</mark4><br>
Discuss the late <mark4>events,</mark4><br>
Correct our watches by the public <mark4>clocks.</mark4><br>
Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks. <br>
<br>
Now that lilacs are in <mark1>bloom</mark1><br>
She has a bowl of lilacs in her <mark1>room</mark1><br>
And twists one in her fingers while she <mark4>talks.</mark4><br>
"Ah, my friend, you do not <mark1>know</mark1>, you do not <mark1>know</mark1><br>
What life <mark4>is</mark4>, you who hold it in your <mark4>hands";</mark4><br>
(Slowly twisting the lilac <mark3>stalks)</mark3><br>
"You let it flow from you, you let it <mark3>flow,</mark3><br>
And youth is cruel, and has no <mark4>remorse</mark4><br>
And smiles at situations which it cannot <mark3>see."</mark3><br>
I smile, of <mark3>course,</mark3><br>
And go on drinking <mark3>tea.</mark3><br>
"Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow <mark4>recall</mark4><br>
My buried life, and Paris in the <mark4>Spring,</mark4><br>
I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
To be wonderful and <mark4>youthful</mark4>, after <mark3>all."</mark3><br>
The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune <br>
<br>
Of a broken violin on an August <mark1>afternoon:</mark1><br>
"I am always sure that you <mark4>understand</mark4><br>
My feelings, always sure that you <mark4>feel,</mark4><br>
Sure that across the gulf you reach your <mark3>hand.</mark3><br>
You are <mark4>invulnerable</mark4>, you have no Achilles' <mark3>heel.</mark3><br>
<br>
You will go on, and when you have <mark4>prevailed</mark4><br>
You can say: at this point many a one has <mark3>failed.</mark3><br>
But what have I, but what have I, my <mark4>friend,</mark4><br>
<br>
To give you, what can you receive from <mark3>me?</mark3><br>
Only the friendship and the sympathy <br>
Of one about to reach her journey's <mark3>end.</mark3><br>
I shall sit here, serving tea to friends <mark1>...."</mark1><br>
<br>
I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly <mark3>amends</mark3><br>
<br>
For what she has said to <mark1>me?</mark1><br>
You will see me any morning in the <mark3>park</mark3><br>
Reading the comics and the sporting <mark3>page.</mark3><br>
Particularly I <mark3>remark.</mark3><br>
An English countess goes upon the <mark3>stage.</mark3><br>
A Greek was murdered at a Polish <mark4>dance,</mark4><br>
Another bank defaulter has <mark4>confessed.</mark4><br>
I keep my <mark4>countenance,</mark4><br>
I remain <mark3>self-possessed</mark3><br>
Except when a street-piano, mechanical and <mark4>tired</mark4><br>
Reiterates some worn-out common <mark4>song</mark4><br>
With the smell of hyacinths across the <mark4>garden</mark4><br>
Recalling things that other people have <mark3>desired.</mark3><br>
Are these ideas right or <mark3>wrong?</mark3><br>
The October night comes down; returning as <mark4>before</mark4><br>
<br>
Except for a slight sensation of being ill at <mark4>ease</mark4><br>
I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the <mark3>door</mark3><br>
And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and <mark3>knees.</mark3><br>
"And so you are going abroad; and when do you <mark4>return?</mark4><br>
But that's a useless <mark4>question.</mark4><br>
You hardly know when you are coming <mark4>back,</mark4><br>
You will find so much to <mark4>learn."</mark4><br>
My smile falls heavily among the <mark4>bric-a-brac.</mark4><br>
"Perhaps you can write to <mark1>me."</mark1><br>
My self-possession flares up for a <mark4>second;</mark4><br>
<br>
This is as I had <mark3>reckoned.</mark3><br>
"I have been wondering frequently of <mark4>late</mark4><br>
(But our beginnings never know our <mark1>ends!)</mark1><br>
Why we have not developed into <mark1>friends."</mark1><br>
I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall <mark1>remark</mark1><br>
Suddenly, his expression in a <mark4>glass.</mark4><br>
My self-possession gutters; we are really in the <mark3>dark.</mark3><br>
"For everybody said so, all our <mark1>friends,</mark1><br>
They all were sure our feelings would <mark3>relate</mark3><br>
<br>
So closely! I myself can hardly <mark1>understand.</mark1><br>
We must leave it now to <mark3>fate.</mark3><br>
You will <mark4>write</mark4>, at any <mark3>rate.</mark3><br>
Perhaps it is not too <mark1>late.</mark1><br>
I shall sit here, serving tea to <mark1>friends."</mark1><br>
And I must borrow every changing <mark3>shape</mark3><br>
To find expression ... <mark1>dance</mark1>, <mark1>dance</mark1><br>
Like a dancing <mark4>bear,</mark4><br>
Cry like a parrot, chatter like an <mark3>ape.</mark3><br>
Let us take the air, in a tobacco <mark1>trance--</mark1><br>
Well! and what if she should die some <mark1>afternoon,</mark1><br>
Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and <mark4>rose;</mark4><br>
Should die and leave me sitting pen in <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
With the smoke coming down above the housetops; <br>
<mark4>Doubtful</mark4>, for quite a <mark4>while</mark4><br>
Not knowing what to feel or if I <mark1>understand</mark1><br>
Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon <mark3>...</mark3><br>
Would she not have the advantage, after <mark1>all?</mark1><br>
This music is successful with a "dying <mark3>fall"</mark3><br>
Now that we talk of <mark4>dying--</mark4><br>
And should I have the right to <mark4>smile?</mark4><br>
