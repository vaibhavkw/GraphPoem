Title : When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd <br>
Author : Walt Whitman <br><br>

<br>
When lilacs last in the dooryard <mark4>bloom'd,</mark4><br>
And the great star early droop'd in the western sky in the <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
I mourn'd, and yet shall mourn with ever-returning <mark3>spring.</mark3><br>
<br>
Ever-returning <mark3>spring</mark3>, trinity sure to me you <mark3>bring,</mark3><br>
Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the <mark4>west,</mark4><br>
And thought of him I <mark1>love.</mark1><br>
<br>
O powerful western fallen <mark1>star!</mark1><br>
O shades of night--O moody, tearful <mark1>night!</mark1><br>
O great star disappear'd--O the black murk that hides the <mark1>star!</mark1><br>
O cruel hands that hold me powerless--O helpless soul of <mark3>me!</mark3><br>
O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my <mark4>soul.</mark4><br>
In the dooryard fronting an old farm-house near the white-wash'd palings, <br>
<br>
Stands the lilac-bush tall-growing with heart-shaped leaves of rich <mark1>green,</mark1><br>
With many a pointed blossom rising delicate, with the perfume strong I <mark1>love,</mark1><br>
With every leaf a miracle--and from this bush in the dooryard, <br>
With delicate-color'd blossoms and heart-shaped leaves of rich <mark1>green,</mark1><br>
A sprig with its flower I <mark4>break.</mark4><br>
In the swamp in secluded <mark4>recesses,</mark4><br>
A shy and hidden bird is warbling a <mark4>song.</mark4><br>
<br>
Solitary the <mark5>thrush,</mark5><br>
The hermit withdrawn to himself, avoiding the <mark4>settlements,</mark4><br>
Sings by himself a <mark1>song.</mark1><br>
<br>
Song of the bleeding <mark4>throat,</mark4><br>
Death's outlet song of life, (for well dear brother I <mark3>know,</mark3><br>
If thou wast not granted to sing thou would'st surely die.) <br>
<br>
Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid <mark4>cities,</mark4><br>
Amid lanes and through old woods, where lately the violets peep'd from the ground, spotting the gray <mark3>debris,</mark3><br>
Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes, passing the endless <mark4>grass,</mark4><br>
<br>
Passing the yellow-spear'd wheat, every grain from its shroud in the dark-brown fields uprisen, <br>
Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the <mark4>orchards,</mark4><br>
Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the <mark4>grave,</mark4><br>
Night and day journeys a <mark4>coffin.</mark4><br>
Coffin that passes through lanes and <mark4>streets,</mark4><br>
Through day and night with the great cloud darkening the <mark4>land,</mark4><br>
With the pomp of the inloop'd flags with the cities draped in <mark4>black,</mark4><br>
With the show of the States themselves as of crape-veil'd women <mark4>standing,</mark4><br>
<br>
With processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
With the countless torches lit, with the silent sea of faces and the unbared <mark4>heads,</mark4><br>
With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre <mark4>faces,</mark4><br>
With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong and <mark4>solemn,</mark4><br>
With all the mournful voices of the dirges pour'd around the <mark1>coffin,</mark1><br>
The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs--where amid these you <mark4>journey,</mark4><br>
With the tolling tolling bells' perpetual <mark4>clang,</mark4><br>
Here, coffin that slowly <mark4>passes,</mark4><br>
I give you my sprig of <mark4>lilac.</mark4><br>
(Nor for you, for one <mark4>alone,</mark4><br>
Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I <mark1>bring,</mark1><br>
For fresh as the morning, thus would I chant a song for you O sane and sacred <mark1>death.</mark1><br>
All over bouquets of <mark4>roses,</mark4><br>
O death, I cover you over with roses and early <mark4>lilies,</mark4><br>
<br>
But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the <mark4>first,</mark4><br>
Copious I break, I break the sprigs from the <mark4>bushes,</mark4><br>
With loaded arms I come, pouring for <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
For you and the coffins all of you O <mark1>death.)</mark1><br>
<br>
O western orb sailing the <mark4>heaven,</mark4><br>
Now I know what you must have meant as a month since I <mark4>walk'd,</mark4><br>
As I walk'd in silence the transparent shadowy <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
As you droop'd from the sky low down as if to my side, (while the other stars all look'd <mark4>on,)</mark4><br>
As we wander'd together the solemn night, (for something I know not what kept me from <mark4>sleep,)</mark4><br>
<br>
As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west how full you were of <mark3>woe,</mark3><br>
As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool transparent <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
As I watch'd where you pass'd and was lost in the netherward black of the <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
As my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank, as where you sad orb, <br>
Concluded, dropt in the night, and was <mark3>gone.</mark3><br>
Sing on there in the <mark4>swamp,</mark4><br>
O singer bashful and tender, I hear your notes, I hear your <mark4>call,</mark4><br>
I hear, I come presently, I understand <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
But a moment I linger, for the lustrous star has detain'd <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
The star my departing comrade holds and detains <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I <mark4>loved?</mark4><br>
And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has <mark1>gone?</mark1><br>
<br>
And what shall my perfume be for the grave of him I <mark1>love?</mark1><br>
Sea-winds blown from east and <mark1>west,</mark1><br>
Blown from the Eastern sea and blown from the Western sea, till there on the prairies <mark4>meeting,</mark4><br>
These and with these and the breath of my <mark4>chant,</mark4><br>
I'll perfume the grave of him I <mark1>love.</mark1><br>
O what shall I hang on the chamber <mark4>walls?</mark4><br>
<br>
And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the <mark1>walls,</mark1><br>
To adorn the burial-house of him I <mark1>love?</mark1><br>
Pictures of growing spring and farms and <mark4>homes,</mark4><br>
With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and <mark4>bright,</mark4><br>
<br>
With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun, burning, expanding the <mark4>air,</mark4><br>
With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves of the trees <mark4>prolific,</mark4><br>
In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a wind-dapple here and <mark3>there,</mark3><br>
With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, and <mark4>shadows,</mark4><br>
<br>
And the city at hand with dwellings so dense, and stacks of <mark4>chimneys,</mark4><br>
And all the scenes of life and the workshops, and the workmen homeward <mark4>returning.</mark4><br>
Lo, body and soul--this <mark1>land,</mark1><br>
My own Manhattan with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides, and the <mark4>ships,</mark4><br>
<br>
The varied and ample land, the South and the North in the light, Ohio's shores and flashing <mark4>Missouri,</mark4><br>
And ever the far-spreading prairies cover'd with grass and <mark4>corn.</mark4><br>
Lo, the most excellent sun so calm and <mark4>haughty,</mark4><br>
The violet and purple morn with just-felt <mark4>breezes,</mark4><br>
The gentle soft-born measureless <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
The miracle spreading bathing all, the fulfill'd <mark4>noon,</mark4><br>
The coming eve delicious, the welcome night and the <mark4>stars,</mark4><br>
Over my cities shining all, enveloping man and <mark1>land.</mark1><br>
<br>
Sing on, sing on you gray-brown <mark4>bird,</mark4><br>
Sing from the swamps, the <mark4>recesses</mark4>, pour your chant from the <mark1>bushes,</mark1><br>
Limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and <mark4>pines.</mark4><br>
Sing on dearest brother, warble your reedy <mark1>song,</mark1><br>
Loud human song, with voice of uttermost <mark1>woe.</mark1><br>
<br>
O liquid and free and <mark4>tender!</mark4><br>
O wild and loose to my soul--O wondrous <mark4>singer!</mark4><br>
You only I hear--yet the star holds me, (but will soon <mark4>depart,)</mark4><br>
Yet the lilac with mastering odor holds <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
Now while I sat in the day and look'd <mark4>forth,</mark4><br>
In the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring, and the farmers preparing their <mark4>crops,</mark4><br>
<br>
In the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes and <mark4>forests,</mark4><br>
In the heavenly aerial beauty, (after the perturb'd winds and the <mark4>storms,)</mark4><br>
Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the voices of children and <mark4>women,</mark4><br>
The many-moving <mark4>sea-tides</mark4>, and I saw the ships how they <mark4>sail'd,</mark4><br>
<br>
And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with <mark4>labor,</mark4><br>
And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its meals and minutia of daily <mark4>usages,</mark4><br>
<br>
And the streets how their throbbings throbb'd, and the cities pent--lo, then and <mark1>there,</mark1><br>
Falling upon them all and among them all, enveloping me with the <mark4>rest,</mark4><br>
Appear'd the cloud, appear'd the long black <mark4>trail,</mark4><br>
And I knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of <mark1>death.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
And the thought of death close-walking the other side of <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
And I in the middle as with <mark1>companions</mark1>, and as holding the hands of <mark4>companions,</mark4><br>
I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks <mark4>not,</mark4><br>
Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the <mark5>dimness,</mark5><br>
To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so <mark4>still.</mark4><br>
And the singer so shy to the rest receiv'd <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
The gray-brown bird I know receiv'd us comrades <mark3>three,</mark3><br>
And he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him I <mark1>love.</mark1><br>
From deep secluded <mark1>recesses,</mark1><br>
From the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so <mark1>still,</mark1><br>
Came the carol of the <mark1>bird.</mark1><br>
And the charm of the carol rapt <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
<br>
As I held as if by their hands my comrades in the <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the <mark1>bird.</mark1><br>
Come lovely and soothing <mark1>death,</mark1><br>
Undulate round the world, serenely <mark1>arriving</mark1>, <mark4>arriving,</mark4><br>
In the day, in the night, to all, to each, <br>
Sooner or later delicate <mark1>death.</mark1><br>
<br>
Prais'd be the fathomless <mark4>universe,</mark4><br>
For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge <mark4>curious,</mark4><br>
And for love, sweet love--but praise! praise! <mark4>praise!</mark4><br>
<br>
For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding <mark1>death.</mark1><br>
Dark mother always gliding near with soft <mark4>feet,</mark4><br>
Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest <mark4>welcome?</mark4><br>
<br>
Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above <mark4>all,</mark4><br>
I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly. <br>
Approach strong deliveress, <br>
<br>
When it is so, when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the <mark4>dead,</mark4><br>
Lost in the loving floating ocean of <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
Laved in the flood of thy bliss O <mark1>death.</mark1><br>
From me to thee glad serenades, <br>
<br>
Dances for thee I propose saluting <mark1>thee</mark1>, adornments and feastings for <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
And the sights of the open landscape and the high-spread sky are <mark4>fitting,</mark4><br>
And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful <mark1>night.</mark1><br>
The night in silence under many a <mark1>star,</mark1><br>
<br>
The ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I <mark1>know,</mark1><br>
And the soul turning to thee O vast and well-veil'd <mark1>death,</mark1><br>
And the body gratefully nestling close to <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
Over the tree-tops I float thee a <mark1>song,</mark1><br>
<br>
Over the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the prairies <mark4>wide,</mark4><br>
Over the dense-pack'd cities all and the teeming wharves and <mark3>ways,</mark3><br>
I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee O <mark1>death.</mark1><br>
To the tally of my <mark1>soul,</mark1><br>
<br>
Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown <mark1>bird,</mark1><br>
With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the <mark1>night.</mark1><br>
Loud in the pines and cedars <mark4>dim,</mark4><br>
Clear in the freshness moist and the <mark4>swamp-perfume,</mark4><br>
<br>
And I with my comrades there in the <mark1>night.</mark1><br>
While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed, <br>
As to long panoramas of <mark4>visions.</mark4><br>
And I saw askant the <mark4>armies,</mark4><br>
<br>
I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of <mark4>battle-flags,</mark4><br>
Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc'd with missiles I saw <mark4>them,</mark4><br>
And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and <mark4>bloody,</mark4><br>
And at last but a few shreds left on the <mark4>staffs</mark4>, (and all in <mark4>silence,)</mark4><br>
<br>
And the staffs all splinter'd and <mark4>broken.</mark4><br>
I saw battle-corpses, myriads of <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
And the white skeletons of young men, I saw <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
I saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the <mark4>war,</mark4><br>
<br>
But I saw they were not as was <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
They themselves were fully at <mark4>rest</mark4>, they suffer'd <mark1>not,</mark1><br>
The living remain'd and <mark1>suffer'd</mark1>, the mother <mark4>suffer'd,</mark4><br>
<br>
And the wife and the child and the musing comrade <mark1>suffer'd,</mark1><br>
And the armies that remain'd <mark1>suffer'd.</mark1><br>
<br>
Passing the visions, passing the <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades' <mark4>hands,</mark4><br>
Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my <mark1>soul,</mark1><br>
Victorious <mark1>song</mark1>, death's outlet song, yet varying ever-altering <mark1>song,</mark1><br>
As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling, flooding the <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again bursting with joy, <br>
<br>
Covering the earth and filling the spread of the <mark1>heaven,</mark1><br>
As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from <mark1>recesses,</mark1><br>
Passing, I leave thee lilac with heart-shaped <mark4>leaves,</mark4><br>
I leave thee there in the door-yard, <mark4>blooming</mark4>, returning with <mark1>spring.</mark1><br>
I cease from my song for <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
O comrade lustrous with silver face in the <mark1>night.</mark1><br>
Yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
<br>
The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown <mark1>bird,</mark1><br>
And the tallying chant, the echo arous'd in my <mark1>soul,</mark1><br>
With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of <mark1>woe,</mark1><br>
With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the <mark1>bird,</mark1><br>
Comrades mine and I in the midst, and their memory ever to keep, for the dead I loved so <mark4>well,</mark4><br>
For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands--and this for his dear <mark4>sake,</mark4><br>
Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my <mark1>soul,</mark1><br>
There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and <mark1>dim.</mark1><br>
