<br>
Another year!?another deadly <mark3>blow!</mark3><br>
Another mighty Empire <mark3>overthrown!</mark3><br>
And We are left, or shall be left, <mark3>alone;</mark3><br>
The last that dare to struggle with the <mark3>Foe.</mark3><br>
'Tis well! from this day forward we shall <mark3>know</mark3><br>
That in ourselves our safety must be <mark3>sought;</mark3><br>
That by our own right hands it must be <mark3>wrought;</mark3><br>
That we must stand unpropped, or be laid <mark3>low.</mark3><br>
O dastard whom such foretaste doth not <mark3>cheer!</mark3><br>
We shall exult, if they who rule the <mark3>land</mark3><br>
Be men who hold its many blessings <mark3>dear,</mark3><br>
Wise, upright, valiant; not a servile <mark3>band,</mark3><br>
Who are to judge of danger which they <mark3>fear,</mark3><br>
And honour which they do not <mark3>understand.</mark3><br>
