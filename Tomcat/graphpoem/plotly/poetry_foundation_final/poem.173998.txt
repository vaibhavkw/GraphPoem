Title : Il Penseroso <br>
Author : John Milton <br><br>

Hence vain deluding <mark3>Joys,</mark3><br>
The brood of Folly without father <mark4>bred,</mark4><br>
How little you <mark4>bested,</mark4><br>
Or fill the fixed mind with all your <mark3>toys;</mark3><br>
Dwell in some idle <mark3>brain,</mark3><br>
And fancies fond with gaudy shapes <mark4>possess,</mark4><br>
As thick and numberless <br>
As the gay motes that people the <mark5>sunbeams,</mark5><br>
Or likest hovering <mark4>dreams,</mark4><br>
The fickle pensioners of Morpheus' <mark3>train.</mark3><br>
But hail thou goddess, sage and <mark4>holy,</mark4><br>
Hail divinest <mark4>Melancholy,</mark4><br>
Whose saintly visage is too <mark3>bright</mark3><br>
To hit the sense of human <mark3>sight;</mark3><br>
And therefore to our weaker <mark3>view,</mark3><br>
O'er-laid with black, staid Wisdom's <mark3>hue;</mark3><br>
Black, but such as in <mark4>esteem,</mark4><br>
Prince Memnon's sister might <mark5>beseem,</mark5><br>
Or that starr'd Ethiop queen that <mark4>strove</mark4><br>
To set her beauty's praise <mark4>above</mark4><br>
The sea nymphs, and their powers <mark4>offended.</mark4><br>
Yet thou art higher far <mark3>descended,</mark3><br>
Thee bright-hair'd Vesta long of <mark3>yore,</mark3><br>
To solitary Saturn <mark3>bore;</mark3><br>
His daughter she (in Saturn's <mark3>reign,</mark3><br>
Such mixture was not held a <mark3>stain)</mark3><br>
Oft in glimmering bow'rs and <mark4>glades</mark4><br>
He met her, and in secret <mark3>shades</mark3><br>
Of woody Ida's inmost <mark4>grove,</mark4><br>
While yet there was no fear of Jove. <br>
Come pensive nun, devout and <mark4>pure,</mark4><br>
Sober, stedfast, and <mark3>demure,</mark3><br>
All in a robe of darkest <mark3>grain,</mark3><br>
Flowing with majestic <mark1>train,</mark1><br>
And sable stole of cypress <mark4>lawn,</mark4><br>
Over thy decent shoulders <mark3>drawn.</mark3><br>
Come, but keep thy wonted <mark4>state,</mark4><br>
With ev'n step, and musing <mark3>gait,</mark3><br>
And looks commercing with the <mark4>skies,</mark4><br>
Thy rapt soul sitting in thine <mark3>eyes:</mark3><br>
There held in holy passion <mark3>still,</mark3><br>
Forget thyself to <mark4>marble</mark4>, <mark3>till</mark3><br>
With a sad leaden downward <mark4>cast,</mark4><br>
Thou fix them on the earth as <mark3>fast.</mark3><br>
And join with thee calm Peace, and <mark4>Quiet,</mark4><br>
Spare <mark4>Fast</mark4>, that oft with gods doth <mark3>diet,</mark3><br>
And hears the Muses in a <mark3>ring,</mark3><br>
Aye round about Jove's altar <mark3>sing.</mark3><br>
And add to these retired <mark3>Leisure,</mark3><br>
That in trim gardens takes his <mark3>pleasure;</mark3><br>
But first, and chiefest, with thee <mark3>bring</mark3><br>
Him that yon soars on golden <mark3>wing,</mark3><br>
Guiding the fiery-wheeled <mark4>throne,</mark4><br>
The cherub <mark4>Contemplation;</mark4><br>
And the mute Silence hist <mark4>along,</mark4><br>
'Less Philomel will deign a <mark3>song,</mark3><br>
In her <mark4>sweetest</mark4>, saddest <mark4>plight,</mark4><br>
Smoothing the rugged brow of <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
While Cynthia checks her dragon <mark3>yoke,</mark3><br>
Gently o'er th' accustom'd <mark3>oak.</mark3><br>
Sweet bird that shunn'st the noise of <mark4>folly,</mark4><br>
Most musical, most <mark1>melancholy!</mark1><br>
Thee, chauntress, oft the woods <mark4>among,</mark4><br>
I woo to hear thy <mark4>even-song;</mark4><br>
And missing thee, I walk <mark4>unseen</mark4><br>
On the dry smooth-shaven <mark3>green,</mark3><br>
To behold the wand'ring <mark4>Moon,</mark4><br>
Riding near her highest <mark3>noon,</mark3><br>
Like one that had been led <mark3>astray</mark3><br>
Through the heav'ns wide pathless <mark3>way;</mark3><br>
And oft, as if her head she <mark4>bow'd,</mark4><br>
Stooping through a fleecy <mark4>cloud.</mark4><br>
Oft on a plat of rising <mark4>ground,</mark4><br>
I hear the far-off curfew <mark3>sound,</mark3><br>
Over some wide-water'd <mark4>shore,</mark4><br>
Swinging slow with sullen <mark3>roar;</mark3><br>
Or if the air will not <mark4>permit,</mark4><br>
Some still removed place will <mark3>fit,</mark3><br>
Where glowing embers through the <mark4>room</mark4><br>
Teach light to counterfeit a <mark3>gloom,</mark3><br>
Far from all resort of <mark4>mirth,</mark4><br>
Save the cricket on the <mark4>hearth,</mark4><br>
Or the bellman's drowsy <mark4>charm,</mark4><br>
To bless the doors from nightly <mark3>harm.</mark3><br>
Or let my lamp at midnight <mark4>hour,</mark4><br>
Be seen in some high lonely <mark3>tow'r,</mark3><br>
Where I may oft out-watch the <mark4>Bear,</mark4><br>
With thrice great Hermes, or <mark5>unsphere</mark5><br>
The spirit of Plato, to <mark4>unfold</mark4><br>
What worlds, or what vast regions <mark3>hold</mark3><br>
The immortal mind that hath <mark4>forsook</mark4><br>
Her mansion in this fleshly <mark3>nook:</mark3><br>
And of those daemons that are <mark4>found</mark4><br>
In fire, air, <mark4>flood</mark4>, or under <mark1>ground,</mark1><br>
Whose power hath a true <mark4>consent</mark4><br>
With <mark4>planet</mark4>, or with <mark4>element.</mark4><br>
Sometime let gorgeous <mark4>Tragedy</mark4><br>
In sceptr'd pall come sweeping <mark3>by,</mark3><br>
Presenting Thebes', or Pelop's <mark4>line,</mark4><br>
Or the tale of Troy <mark3>divine,</mark3><br>
Or what (though rare) of later <mark3>age,</mark3><br>
Ennobled hath the buskin'd <mark3>stage.</mark3><br>
But, O sad Virgin, that thy <mark3>power</mark3><br>
Might raise Musaeus from his <mark3>bower,</mark3><br>
Or bid the soul of Orpheus <mark1>sing</mark1><br>
Such notes as, warbled to the <mark3>string,</mark3><br>
Drew iron tears down Pluto's <mark4>cheek,</mark4><br>
And made Hell grant what love did <mark3>seek.</mark3><br>
Or call up him that left half <mark4>told</mark4><br>
The story of Cambuscan <mark3>bold,</mark3><br>
Of Camball, and of Algarsife, <br>
And who had Canace to <mark4>wife,</mark4><br>
That own'd the virtuous ring and <mark4>glass,</mark4><br>
And of the wond'rous horse of <mark3>brass,</mark3><br>
On which the Tartar king did <mark4>ride;</mark4><br>
And if aught else, great bards <mark3>beside,</mark3><br>
In sage and solemn tunes have <mark4>sung,</mark4><br>
Of tourneys and of trophies <mark3>hung,</mark3><br>
Of forests, and enchantments <mark5>drear,</mark5><br>
Where more is meant than meets the <mark4>ear.</mark4><br>
Thus, Night, oft see me in thy pale <mark3>career,</mark3><br>
Till civil-suited Morn <mark3>appear,</mark3><br>
Not trick'd and frounc'd as she was <mark4>wont,</mark4><br>
With the Attic boy to <mark4>hunt,</mark4><br>
But kerchief'd in a comely <mark1>cloud,</mark1><br>
While rocking winds are piping <mark3>loud,</mark3><br>
Or usher'd with a shower <mark1>still,</mark1><br>
When the gust hath blown his <mark3>fill,</mark3><br>
Ending on the rustling <mark4>leaves,</mark4><br>
With minute-drops from off the <mark3>eaves.</mark3><br>
And when the Sun begins to <mark4>fling</mark4><br>
His flaring beams, me, goddess, <mark1>bring</mark1><br>
To arched walks of twilight <mark4>groves,</mark4><br>
And shadows brown that Sylvan <mark4>loves,</mark4><br>
Of pine, or monumental <mark1>oak,</mark1><br>
Where the rude axe with heaved <mark3>stroke,</mark3><br>
Was never heard the nymphs to <mark4>daunt,</mark4><br>
Or fright them from their hallow'd <mark3>haunt.</mark3><br>
There in close covert by some <mark4>brook,</mark4><br>
Where no profaner eye may <mark3>look,</mark3><br>
Hide me from Day's garish <mark3>eye,</mark3><br>
While the bee with honied <mark3>thigh,</mark3><br>
That at her flow'ry work doth <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
And the waters <mark4>murmuring</mark4><br>
With such consort as they <mark3>keep,</mark3><br>
Entice the dewy-feather'd <mark3>sleep;</mark3><br>
And let some strange mysterious <mark4>dream,</mark4><br>
Wave at his wings, in airy <mark3>stream</mark3><br>
Of lively portraiture <mark4>display'd,</mark4><br>
Softly on my eye-lids <mark4>laid.</mark4><br>
And as I wake, sweet music <mark5>breathe</mark5><br>
Above, about, or <mark4>underneath,</mark4><br>
Sent by some spirit to mortals <mark4>good,</mark4><br>
Or th' unseen Genius of the <mark3>wood.</mark3><br>
<br>
But let my due feet never <mark4>fail</mark4><br>
To walk the studious cloister's <mark3>pale,</mark3><br>
And love the high embowed <mark4>roof,</mark4><br>
With antique pillars massy <mark3>proof,</mark3><br>
And storied windows richly dight, <br>
Casting a dim religious <mark4>light.</mark4><br>
There let the pealing organ <mark3>blow,</mark3><br>
To the full-voic'd quire <mark3>below,</mark3><br>
In service high, and anthems <mark3>clear,</mark3><br>
As may with sweetness, through mine <mark1>ear,</mark1><br>
Dissolve me into ecstasies, <br>
And bring all Heav'n before mine <mark1>eyes.</mark1><br>
And may at last my weary <mark1>age</mark1><br>
Find out the peaceful <mark4>hermitage,</mark4><br>
The hairy gown and mossy <mark4>cell,</mark4><br>
Where I may sit and rightly <mark3>spell</mark3><br>
Of every star that Heav'n doth <mark3>shew,</mark3><br>
And every herb that sips the <mark3>dew;</mark3><br>
Till old experience do <mark4>attain</mark4><br>
To something like prophetic <mark3>strain.</mark3><br>
These pleasures, Melancholy, <mark4>give,</mark4><br>
And I with thee will choose to <mark3>live.</mark3><br>
