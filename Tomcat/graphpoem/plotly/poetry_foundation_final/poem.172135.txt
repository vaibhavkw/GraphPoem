Title : The Youngest Daughter <br>
Author : Cathy Song <br><br>

The sky has been dark <br>
for many <mark4>years.</mark4><br>
My skin has become as <mark4>damp</mark4><br>
and pale as rice <mark4>paper</mark4><br>
and feels the way <br>
mother's used to before the drying <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
parched it out there in the <mark4>fields.</mark4><br>
<br>
Lately, when I touch my <mark4>eyelids,</mark4><br>
my hands react as if <br>
I had just touched <mark4>something</mark4><br>
hot enough to <mark4>burn.</mark4><br>
My skin, aspirin <mark4>colored,</mark4><br>
tingles with migraine. <mark4>Mother</mark4><br>
has been massaging the left side of my <mark4>face</mark4><br>
especially in the <mark4>evenings</mark4><br>
when the pain flares <mark4>up.</mark4><br>
<br>
This <mark4>morning</mark4><br>
her breathing was graveled, <br>
her voice gruff with <mark4>affection</mark4><br>
when I wheeled her into the <mark5>bath.</mark5><br>
She was in a good <mark4>humor,</mark4><br>
making jokes about her great <mark4>breasts,</mark4><br>
floating in the milky <mark4>water</mark4><br>
like two <mark4>walruses,</mark4><br>
flaccid and whiskered around the <mark4>nipples.</mark4><br>
I scrubbed them with a sour taste   <br>
in my mouth, <mark4>thinking:</mark4><br>
six children and an old <mark4>man</mark4><br>
have sucked from these brown <mark1>nipples.</mark1><br>
<br>
I was almost <mark4>tender</mark4><br>
when I came to the blue <mark4>bruises</mark4><br>
that freckle her <mark4>body,</mark4><br>
places where she has been injecting <mark4>insulin</mark4><br>
for thirty years. I soaped her <mark4>slowly,</mark4><br>
she sighed deeply, her eyes <mark4>closed.</mark4><br>
It seems it has <mark4>always</mark4><br>
been like this: the two of <mark4>us</mark4><br>
in this sunless room, <br>
the splashing of the <mark5>bathwater.</mark5><br>
<br>
In the <mark4>afternoons</mark4><br>
when she has <mark4>rested,</mark4><br>
she prepares our ritual of tea and <mark4>rice,</mark4><br>
garnished with a shred of gingered fish, <br>
a slice of pickled <mark4>turnip,</mark4><br>
a token for my white <mark1>body.</mark1><br>
We eat in the familiar <mark4>silence.</mark4><br>
She knows I am not to be <mark4>trusted,</mark4><br>
even now planning my <mark4>escape.</mark4><br>
As I toast to her <mark4>health</mark4><br>
with the tea she has <mark4>poured,</mark4><br>
a thousand cranes curtain the window, <br>
fly up in a sudden <mark4>breeze.</mark4><br>
