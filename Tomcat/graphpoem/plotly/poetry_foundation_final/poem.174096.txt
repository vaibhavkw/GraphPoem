Title : Interview <br>
Author : Dorothy Parker <br><br>

The ladies men admire, I've <mark3>heard,</mark3><br>
Would shudder at a wicked <mark3>word.</mark3><br>
Their candle gives a single <mark3>light;</mark3><br>
They'd rather stay at home at <mark3>night.</mark3><br>
They do not keep awake till three, <br>
Nor read erotic poetry. <br>
They never sanction the impure, <br>
Nor recognize an overture. <br>
They shrink from powders and from paints <mark3>...</mark3><br>
So far, I've had no <mark3>complaints.</mark3><br>
