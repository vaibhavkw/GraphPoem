Title : The Song of the Wreck <br>
Author : Charles Dickens <br><br>

The wind blew high, the waters <mark4>raved,</mark4><br>
A ship drove on the <mark4>land,</mark4><br>
A hundred human creatures <mark4>saved</mark4><br>
Kneel'd down upon the <mark4>sand.</mark4><br>
Three-score were drown'd, three-score were <mark3>thrown</mark3><br>
Upon the black rocks <mark4>wild,</mark4><br>
And thus among them, left <mark3>alone,</mark3><br>
They found one helpless <mark3>child.</mark3><br>
<br>
A seaman rough, to shipwreck <mark4>bred,</mark4><br>
Stood out from all the <mark3>rest,</mark3><br>
And gently laid the lonely <mark3>head</mark3><br>
Upon his honest <mark3>breast.</mark3><br>
And travelling o'er the desert <mark4>wide</mark4><br>
It was a solemn <mark3>joy,</mark3><br>
To see them, ever side by <mark3>side,</mark3><br>
The sailor and the <mark3>boy.</mark3><br>
<br>
In famine, sickness, hunger, <mark4>thirst,</mark4><br>
The two were still but <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
Until the strong man droop'd the <mark3>first</mark3><br>
And felt his labours <mark3>done.</mark3><br>
Then to a trusty friend he <mark3>spake,</mark3><br>
"Across the desert <mark1>wide,</mark1><br>
O take this poor boy for my <mark3>sake!"</mark3><br>
And kiss'd the child and <mark3>died.</mark3><br>
<br>
Toiling along in weary <mark4>plight</mark4><br>
Through heavy jungle, <mark3>mire,</mark3><br>
These two came later every <mark3>night</mark3><br>
To warm them at the <mark3>fire.</mark3><br>
Until the captain said one <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
"O seaman good and <mark4>kind,</mark4><br>
To save thyself now come <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
And leave the boy <mark3>behind!"</mark3><br>
<br>
The child was slumbering near the <mark3>blaze:</mark3><br>
"O captain, let him <mark1>rest</mark1><br>
Until it sinks, when God's own <mark3>ways</mark3><br>
Shall teach us what is <mark3>best!"</mark3><br>
They watch'd the whiten'd ashy <mark5>heap,</mark5><br>
They touch'd the child in <mark4>vain;</mark4><br>
They did not leave him there <mark3>asleep,</mark3><br>
He never woke <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
