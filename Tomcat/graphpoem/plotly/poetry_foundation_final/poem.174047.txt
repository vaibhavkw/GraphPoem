From The <mark4>Fire-worshippers</mark4><br>
"How sweetly," said the trembling <mark3>maid,</mark3><br>
Of her own gentle voice <mark3>afraid,</mark3><br>
So long had they in silence <mark4>stood,</mark4><br>
Looking upon that tranquil <mark4>flood--</mark4><br>
"How sweetly does the moon-beam <mark3>smile</mark3><br>
To-night upon yon leafy <mark3>isle!</mark3><br>
Oft in my fancy's <mark4>wanderings,</mark4><br>
I've wish'd that little isle had <mark4>wings,</mark4><br>
And we, within its fairy <mark4>bow'rs,</mark4><br>
Were wafted off to seas <mark3>unknown,</mark3><br>
Where not a pulse should beat but <mark4>ours,</mark4><br>
And we might live, love, die <mark3>alone!</mark3><br>
Far from the cruel and the <mark4>cold,--</mark4><br>
Where the bright eyes of angels <mark3>only</mark3><br>
Should come around us, to <mark3>behold</mark3><br>
A paradise so pure and <mark3>lonely.</mark3><br>
Would this be world enough for <mark3>thee?"--</mark3><br>
Playful she turn'd, that he might <mark3>see</mark3><br>
The passing smile her cheek put <mark4>on;</mark4><br>
But when she mark'd how mournfully <br>
His eyes met hers, that smile was <mark3>gone;</mark3><br>
And, bursting into heart-felt <mark4>tears,</mark4><br>
"Yes, yes," she cried, "my hourly <mark3>fears</mark3><br>
My dreams have boded all too <mark4>right--</mark4><br>
We part--for ever part--to-night! <br>
I knew, I knew it  could not <mark4>last--</mark4><br>
'Twas bright, 'twas heav'nly, but 'tis <mark3>past!</mark3><br>
Oh! ever thus, from childhood's <mark4>hour,</mark4><br>
I've seen my fondest hopes <mark3>decay;</mark3><br>
I never lov'd a tree or <mark4>flow'r,</mark4><br>
But 'twas the first to fade <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
I never nurs'd a dear <mark4>gazelle</mark4><br>
To glad me with its soft black <mark3>eye,</mark3><br>
But when it came to know me <mark3>well</mark3><br>
And love me, it was sure to <mark3>die!</mark3><br>
Now too--the joy most like <mark4>divine</mark4><br>
Of all I ever dreamt or <mark3>knew,</mark3><br>
To see thee, hear thee, call thee <mark3>mine,--</mark3><br>
Oh misery! must I lose  that <mark3>too?</mark3><br>
Yet go--on peril's brink we <mark4>meet;--</mark4><br>
Those frightful rocks--that treach'rous <mark2>sea--</mark2><br>
No, never come again--though <mark3>sweet,</mark3><br>
Though heav'n, it may be death to <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
Farewell--and blessings on thy <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
Where'er thou goest, beloved <mark4>stranger!</mark4><br>
Better to sit and watch that <mark3>ray,</mark3><br>
And think thee safe, though far <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
Than have thee near me, and in <mark3>danger!"</mark3><br>
