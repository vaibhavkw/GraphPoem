Title : The House of Life: 19. Silent Noon <br>
Author : Dante Gabriel Rossetti <br><br>

Your hands lie open in the long fresh <mark3>grass,--</mark3><br>
   The finger-points look through like rosy blooms: <br>
   Your eyes smile peace. The pasture gleams and glooms <br>
'Neath billowing skies that scatter and <mark3>amass.</mark3><br>
All round our nest, far as the eye can <mark3>pass,</mark3><br>
Are golden kingcup fields with silver <mark3>edge</mark3><br>
Where the cow-parsley skirts the <mark3>hawthorn-hedge.</mark3><br>
'Tis visible <mark4>silence</mark4>, still as the <mark4>hour-glass.</mark4><br>
<br>
Deep in the sun-searched growths the dragon-fiy <br>
Hangs like a blue thread loosened from the sky:-- <br>
So this wing'd hour is dropt to us from <mark3>above.</mark3><br>
Oh! clasp we to our hearts, for deathless <mark3>dower,</mark3><br>
This close-companioned inarticulate <mark3>hour</mark3><br>
When twofold silence was the song of <mark3>love.</mark3><br>
