Title : The Owl and the Pussy-Cat <br>
Author : Edward Lear <br><br>

<br>
The Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea <br>
In a beautiful pea-green <mark3>boat,</mark3><br>
They took some <mark3>honey</mark3>, and plenty of <mark3>money,</mark3><br>
Wrapped up in a five-pound <mark3>note.</mark3><br>
The Owl looked up to the stars <mark3>above,</mark3><br>
And sang to a small <mark3>guitar,</mark3><br>
"O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my <mark3>love,</mark3><br>
What a beautiful Pussy you <mark3>are,</mark3><br>
You <mark1>are,</mark1><br>
You <mark1>are!</mark1><br>
What a beautiful Pussy you <mark1>are!"</mark1><br>
<br>
Pussy said to the <mark3>Owl</mark3>, "You elegant <mark3>fowl!</mark3><br>
How charmingly sweet you <mark3>sing!</mark3><br>
O let us be married! too long we have tarried: <br>
But what shall we do for a <mark3>ring?"</mark3><br>
They sailed <mark3>away</mark3>, for a year and a <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
To the land where the Bong-Tree <mark3>grows</mark3><br>
And there in a wood a Piggy-wig <mark4>stood</mark4><br>
With a ring at the end of his <mark3>nose,</mark3><br>
His <mark1>nose,</mark1><br>
His <mark1>nose,</mark1><br>
With a ring at the end of his <mark1>nose.</mark1><br>
"Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one <mark4>shilling</mark4><br>
<br>
Your ring?" Said the Piggy, "I <mark4>will."</mark4><br>
So they took it <mark3>away</mark3>, and were married next <mark1>day</mark1><br>
By the Turkey who lives on the <mark3>hill.</mark3><br>
They dined on <mark3>mince</mark3>, and slices of <mark3>quince,</mark3><br>
Which they ate with a runcible <mark3>spoon;</mark3><br>
And hand in <mark3>hand</mark3>, on the edge of the <mark4>sand,</mark4><br>
They danced by the light of the <mark3>moon,</mark3><br>
The <mark1>moon,</mark1><br>
The <mark1>moon,</mark1><br>
They danced by the light of the <mark1>moon.</mark1><br>
