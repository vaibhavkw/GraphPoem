Title : I Only Am Escaped Alone to Tell Thee <br>
Author : Howard Nemerov <br><br>

I tell you that I see her <mark4>still</mark4><br>
At the dark entrance of the <mark4>hall.</mark4><br>
One gas lamp burning near her <mark4>shoulder</mark4><br>
Shone also from her other <mark4>side</mark4><br>
Where hung the long inaccurate <mark4>glass</mark4><br>
Whose pictures were as troubled <mark4>water.</mark4><br>
An immense shadow had its <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
Between us on the floor, and <mark4>seemed</mark4><br>
To hump the knuckles <mark4>nervously,</mark4><br>
A giant crab readying to walk,   <br>
Or a blanket moving in its sleep. <br>
<br>
You will remember, with a <mark4>smile</mark4><br>
Instructed by movies to <mark4>reminisce,</mark4><br>
How strict her corsets must have been,   <br>
How the huge arrangements of her <mark3>hair</mark3><br>
Would certainly betray the <mark4>least</mark4><br>
Impassionate displacement <mark3>there.</mark3><br>
It was no rig for dallying, <br>
And maybe only marriage <mark4>could</mark4><br>
Derange that queenly scaffolding-- <br>
As when a great ship, coming <mark3>home,</mark3><br>
Coasts in the harbor, dropping <mark4>sail</mark4><br>
And loosing all the tackle that had <mark4>laced</mark4><br>
Her in the long lanes <mark4>....</mark4><br>
                                       I know <br>
We need not draw this figure <mark4>out.</mark4><br>
But all that whalebone came from <mark4>whales.</mark4><br>
And all the whales lived in the sea,   <br>
In calm beneath the troubled <mark1>glass,</mark1><br>
Until the needle drew their <mark4>blood.</mark4><br>
<br>
I see her standing in the <mark1>hall,</mark1><br>
Where the mirror's lashed to blood and <mark3>foam,</mark3><br>
And the black flukes of <mark4>agony</mark4><br>
Beat at the air till the light blows <mark1>out.</mark1><br>
