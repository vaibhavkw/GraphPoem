Title : Sonnet 60: Like as the waves make towards the pebbl'd shore <br>
Author : William Shakespeare <br><br>

Like as the waves make towards the pebbl'd <mark3>shore,</mark3><br>
So do our minutes hasten to their <mark3>end;</mark3><br>
Each changing place with that which goes <mark3>before,</mark3><br>
In sequent toil all forwards do <mark3>contend.</mark3><br>
Nativity, once in the main of <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd, <br>
Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory <mark3>fight,</mark3><br>
And Time that gave doth now his gift <mark4>confound.</mark4><br>
Time doth transfix the flourish set on <mark3>youth</mark3><br>
And delves the parallels in beauty's brow, <br>
Feeds on the rarities of nature's <mark3>truth,</mark3><br>
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow: <br>
And yet to times in hope my verse shall <mark4>stand,</mark4><br>
Praising thy worth, despite his cruel <mark3>hand.</mark3><br>
