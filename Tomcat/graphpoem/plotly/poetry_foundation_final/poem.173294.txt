Title : from The Task, Book V: The Winter Morning Walk <br>
Author : William Cowper <br><br>

<br>
'Tis morning; and the sun with ruddy <mark4>orb</mark4><br>
Ascending, fires the horizon: while the <mark4>clouds</mark4><br>
That crowd away before the driving <mark4>wind,</mark4><br>
More ardent as the disk emerges <mark4>more,</mark4><br>
Resemble most some city in a <mark4>blaze,</mark4><br>
Seen through the leafless wood.  His slanting <mark3>ray</mark3><br>
Slides ineffectual down the snowy <mark4>vale,</mark4><br>
And tinging all with his own rosy hue, <br>
From ev'ry herb and ev'ry spiry <mark4>blade</mark4><br>
Stretches a length of shadow o'er the <mark4>field.</mark4><br>
Mine, spindling into longitude <mark4>immense,</mark4><br>
In spite of gravity, and sage <mark4>remark</mark4><br>
That I myself am but a fleeting <mark4>shade,</mark4><br>
Provokes me to a smile.  With eye <mark4>askance</mark4><br>
I view the muscular proportion'd <mark4>limb</mark4><br>
Transform'd to a lean shank.  The shapeless <mark4>pair,</mark4><br>
As they design'd to mock me, at my <mark4>side</mark4><br>
Take step for step; and as I near approach <br>
The cottage, walk along the plaster'd <mark4>wall,</mark4><br>
Prepost'rous sight! the legs without the <mark4>man.</mark4><br>
The verdure of the plain lies buried <mark3>deep</mark3><br>
Beneath the dazzling deluge; and the bents, <br>
And coarser grass upspearing o'er the <mark4>rest,</mark4><br>
Of late unsightly and <mark4>unseen</mark4>, now <mark4>shine</mark4><br>
Conspicuous, and in bright apparel <mark4>clad,</mark4><br>
And fledg'd with icy feathers, nod <mark4>superb.</mark4><br>
The cattle mourn in corners where the <mark4>fence</mark4><br>
Screens them, and seem half petrified to <mark3>sleep</mark3><br>
In unrecumbent sadness.  There they <mark4>wait</mark4><br>
Their wonted fodder; not like hung'ring <mark1>man</mark1><br>
Fretful if unsupply'd, but silent, <mark4>meek,</mark4><br>
And patient of the slow-pac'd swain's <mark3>delay.</mark3><br>
He from the stack carves out th' accustom'd <mark4>load,</mark4><br>
Deep-plunging, and again deep plunging <mark4>oft</mark4><br>
His broad keen knife into the solid <mark4>mass;</mark4><br>
Smooth as a wall the upright remnant <mark4>stands,</mark4><br>
With such undeviating and even <mark4>force</mark4><br>
He severs it away: no needless <mark3>care</mark3><br>
Lest storms should overset the leaning <mark4>pile</mark4><br>
Deciduous, or its own unbalanc'd <mark4>weight.</mark4><br>
<br>
. . <mark1>.</mark1><br>
<br>
'Tis liberty alone that gives the <mark4>flow'r</mark4><br>
Of fleeting life its lustre and <mark4>perfume,</mark4><br>
And we are weeds without <mark4>it</mark4>, All <mark4>constraint,</mark4><br>
Except what wisdom lays on evil <mark4>men,</mark4><br>
Is evil; hurts the <mark4>faculties</mark4>, <mark4>impedes</mark4><br>
Their progress in the road of science; <mark4>blinds</mark4><br>
The eyesight of discov'ry, and <mark4>begets,</mark4><br>
In those that suffer it, a sordid <mark4>mind</mark4><br>
Bestial, a meagre <mark4>intellect</mark4>, <mark4>unfit</mark4><br>
To be the tenant of man's noble <mark4>form.</mark4><br>
Thee therefore still, blame-worthy as thou <mark4>art,</mark4><br>
With all thy loss of empire, and though squeez'd <br>
By public exigence till annual <mark4>food</mark4><br>
Fails for the craving hunger of the <mark4>state,</mark4><br>
Thee I account still happy, and the chief <br>
Among the nations, seeing thou art free! <br>
My native nook of <mark4>earth!</mark4><br>
<br>
. . <mark1>.</mark1><br>
<br>
   But there is yet a liberty unsung <br>
By poets, and by senators unprais'd, <br>
Which monarchs cannot grant, nor all the <mark4>powers</mark4><br>
Of earth and hell confed'rate take <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
A liberty, which persecution, <mark4>fraud,</mark4><br>
Oppression, prisons, have no pow'r to <mark4>bind,</mark4><br>
Which whoso tastes can be enslav'd no <mark1>more.</mark1><br>
'Tis liberty of heart, deriv'd from heav'n, <br>
Bought with HIS blood who gave it to <mark3>mankind,</mark3><br>
And seal'd with the same token.  It is <mark4>held</mark4><br>
By charter, and that charter sanction'd <mark4>sure</mark4><br>
By th' unimpeachable and awful <mark4>oath</mark4><br>
And promise of a God.  His other <mark4>gifts</mark4><br>
All bear the royal stamp that speaks them <mark4>his,</mark4><br>
And are august, but this transcends them <mark4>all.</mark4><br>
