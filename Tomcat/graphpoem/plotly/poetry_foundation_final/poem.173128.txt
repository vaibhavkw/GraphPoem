Title : Thrice Toss These Oaken Ashes <br>
Author : Thomas Campion <br><br>

Thrice toss these oaken ashes in the <mark3>air,</mark3><br>
Thrice sit thou mute in this enchanted <mark3>chair,</mark3><br>
Then thrice three times tie up this true love's <mark2>knot,</mark2><br>
And murmur soft "She will, or she will <mark2>not."</mark2><br>
<br>
Go burn these pois'nous weeds in yon blue <mark4>fire,</mark4><br>
These screech-owl's feathers and this prickling <mark3>briar,</mark3><br>
This cypress gathered at a dead man's <mark4>grave,</mark4><br>
That all my fears and cares an end may <mark4>have.</mark4><br>
<br>
Then come, you fairies! dance with me a <mark3>round;</mark3><br>
Melt her hard heart with your melodious <mark3>sound.</mark3><br>
In vain are all the charms I can <mark3>devise:</mark3><br>
She hath an art to break them with her <mark3>eyes.</mark3><br>
