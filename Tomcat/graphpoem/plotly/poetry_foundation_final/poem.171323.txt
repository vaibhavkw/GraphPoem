Title : Three Men Walking, Three Brown Silhouettes <br>
Author : Alicia Ostriker <br><br>

They remember the dead who died in the <mark4>resistance.</mark4><br>
It is in sweet tones that they speak of <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
They shake their heads, still, after the <mark4>dinner</mark4><br>
<br>
Walking back to the car, while an evening <mark3>snow</mark3><br>
That has started windlessly, white from pearl-gray,   <br>
Falls into streets that are already slushy. <br>
<br>
They shake their heads, as we do when there is <mark4>something</mark4><br>
Too strange to believe, <br>
Or as a beast does, stunned by a <mark3>blow.</mark3><br>
<br>
"To die in the resistance,"   they say, "is to <mark4>fail</mark4><br>
To turn into slush, to escape this <mark4>ugliness.</mark4><br>
It is at once to leap, a creamy <mark4>swan,</mark4><br>
<br>
Upward."   Three voices: oboe, <mark4>piano</mark4>, <mark4>cello.</mark4><br>
The high one wishes to be pleasing, the <mark4>middle</mark4><br>
To be practical, the deep to <mark4>persevere.</mark4><br>
<br>
A movie theater lobby in front of <mark1>them</mark1><br>
Throws its light on the sidewalk, like a <mark4>woman</mark4><br>
Swiftly emptying a bucket of <mark4>water:</mark4><br>
<br>
The flakes are falling in its yellow <mark4>light.</mark4><br>
Then they pass a cafe, its light red <mark4>neon,</mark4><br>
Then a closed pharmacy. <br>
<br>
--They pull sharp <mark4>air</mark4><br>
Into their lungs, a pain that is a <mark4>pleasure.</mark4><br>
"Try to live as if there were no <mark4>God,"</mark4><br>
They don't say, but they <mark4>mean.</mark4><br>
<br>
A recollection of purity, a <mark3>clean</mark3><br>
Handkerchief each man feels in his own <mark4>pocket,</mark4><br>
Perturbs them, slows their pace <mark4>down</mark4>, Now they have <mark3>seen</mark3><br>
<br>
A yellow stain on a pile of old <mark1>snow</mark1><br>
Between two parked cars, where a man has <mark4>peed:</mark4><br>
The resistance. The falling flakes, <mark4>falling</mark4><br>
<br>
On the men's hats. And now <br>
The snow grows heavier, falls on their stooping shoulders. <br>
