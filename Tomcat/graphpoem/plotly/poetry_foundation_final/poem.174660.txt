Title : You Ask Me, Why, Tho' Ill at Ease <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

You ask me, why, tho' ill at <mark3>ease,</mark3><br>
Within this region I <mark3>subsist,</mark3><br>
Whose spirits falter in the <mark3>mist,</mark3><br>
And languish for the purple <mark3>seas.</mark3><br>
<br>
It is the land that freemen <mark3>till,</mark3><br>
That sober-suited Freedom <mark4>chose,</mark4><br>
The land, where girt with friends or <mark3>foes</mark3><br>
A man may speak the thing he <mark3>will;</mark3><br>
<br>
A land of settled <mark4>government,</mark4><br>
A land of just and old <mark3>renown,</mark3><br>
Where Freedom slowly broadens <mark3>down</mark3><br>
From precedent to <mark4>precedent:</mark4><br>
<br>
Where faction seldom gathers <mark3>head,</mark3><br>
But by degrees to fullness <mark4>wrought,</mark4><br>
The strength of some diffusive <mark3>thought</mark3><br>
Hath time and space to work and <mark3>spread.</mark3><br>
<br>
Should banded unions <mark4>persecute</mark4><br>
Opinion, and induce a <mark3>time</mark3><br>
When single thought is civil <mark3>crime,</mark3><br>
And individual freedom <mark4>mute;</mark4><br>
<br>
Tho' Power should make from land to <mark4>land</mark4><br>
The name of Britain trebly <mark4>great?</mark4><br>
Tho' every channel of the <mark3>State</mark3><br>
Should fill and choke with golden <mark3>sand?</mark3><br>
<br>
Yet waft me from the <mark3>harbour-mouth,</mark3><br>
Wild wind! I seek a warmer <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
And I will see before I <mark3>die</mark3><br>
The palms and temples of the <mark3>South.</mark3><br>
