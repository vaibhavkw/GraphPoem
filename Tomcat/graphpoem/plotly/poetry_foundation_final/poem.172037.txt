Title : A Name for All <br>
Author : Hart Crane <br><br>

Moonmoth and grasshopper that flee our <mark3>page</mark3><br>
And still wing on, untarnished of the <mark3>name</mark3><br>
We pinion to your bodies to <mark3>assuage</mark3><br>
Our envy of your freedom--we must <mark3>maim</mark3><br>
<br>
Because we are usurpers, and <mark4>chagrined--</mark4><br>
And take the wing and scar it in the <mark4>hand.</mark4><br>
Names we have, even, to clap on the <mark4>wind;</mark4><br>
But we must die, as you, to <mark4>understand.</mark4><br>
<br>
I dreamed that all men dropped their names, and <mark3>sang</mark3><br>
As only they can <mark3>praise</mark3>, who build their <mark3>days</mark3><br>
With fin and hoof, with wing and sweetened <mark3>fang</mark3><br>
Struck free and holy in one Name <mark4>always.</mark4><br>
