Title : Eyes Fastened with Pins <br>
Author : Charles Simic <br><br>

How much death <mark4>works,</mark4><br>
No one knows what a <mark4>long</mark4><br>
Day he puts in. The <mark4>little</mark4><br>
Wife always <mark4>alone</mark4><br>
Ironing death's <mark4>laundry.</mark4><br>
The beautiful <mark4>daughters</mark4><br>
Setting death's supper <mark4>table.</mark4><br>
The neighbors <mark4>playing</mark4><br>
Pinochle in the <mark4>backyard</mark4><br>
Or just sitting on the <mark4>steps</mark4><br>
Drinking beer. Death,   <br>
Meanwhile, in a strange   <br>
Part of town looking <mark4>for</mark4><br>
Someone with a bad cough, <br>
But the address is somehow <mark4>wrong,</mark4><br>
Even death can't figure it out   <br>
Among all the locked doors <mark4>...</mark4><br>
And the rain beginning to <mark4>fall.</mark4><br>
Long windy night <mark4>ahead.</mark4><br>
Death with not even a <mark4>newspaper</mark4><br>
To cover his head, not <mark4>even</mark4><br>
A dime to call the one pining away,   <br>
Undressing <mark4>slowly</mark4>, <mark4>sleepily,</mark4><br>
And stretching <mark4>naked</mark4><br>
On death's side of the <mark4>bed.</mark4><br>
