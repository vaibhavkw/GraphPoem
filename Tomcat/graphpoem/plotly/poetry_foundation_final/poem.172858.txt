Title : Self-Dependence <br>
Author : Matthew Arnold <br><br>

Weary of myself, and sick of <mark4>asking</mark4><br>
What I am, and what I ought to <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
At this vessel's prow I stand, which bears <mark3>me</mark3><br>
Forwards, forwards, o'er the starlit <mark3>sea.</mark3><br>
<br>
And a look of passionate <mark4>desire</mark4><br>
O'er the sea and to the stars I <mark3>send:</mark3><br>
"Ye who from my childhood up have calm'd <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Calm me, ah, compose me to the <mark3>end!</mark3><br>
<br>
"Ah, once more," I cried, "ye <mark4>stars</mark4>, ye <mark4>waters,</mark4><br>
On my heart your mighty charm <mark3>renew;</mark3><br>
Still, still let me, as I gaze upon <mark3>you,</mark3><br>
Feel my soul becoming vast like <mark1>you!"</mark1><br>
<br>
From the intense, clear, star-sown vault of <mark5>heaven,</mark5><br>
Over the lit sea's unquiet <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
In the rustling night-air came the <mark4>answer:</mark4><br>
"Wouldst thou be as these are? Live as <mark3>they.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Unaffrighted by the silence round <mark5>them,</mark5><br>
Undistracted by the sights they <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
These demand not that the things without <mark1>them</mark1><br>
Yield them love, amusement, <mark4>sympathy.</mark4><br>
<br>
"And with joy the stars perform their <mark4>shining,</mark4><br>
And the sea its long moon-silver'd <mark3>roll;</mark3><br>
For self-poised they live, nor pine with <mark4>noting</mark4><br>
All the fever of some differing <mark3>soul.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Bounded by themselves, and unregardful <br>
In what state God's other works may <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
In their own tasks all their powers <mark4>pouring,</mark4><br>
These attain the mighty life you <mark1>see."</mark1><br>
<br>
O air-born voice! long since, severely <mark4>clear,</mark4><br>
A cry like thine in mine own heart I <mark4>hear:</mark4><br>
"Resolve to be thyself; and know that <mark3>he,</mark3><br>
Who finds himself, loses his <mark4>misery!"</mark4><br>
