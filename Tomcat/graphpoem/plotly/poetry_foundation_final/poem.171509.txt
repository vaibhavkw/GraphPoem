Title : Accountability <br>
Author : William E. Stafford <br><br>

Cold nights outside the taverns in <mark4>Wyoming</mark4><br>
pickups and big semis lounge idling, letting their   <br>
haunches twitch now and then in gusts of powder snow,   <br>
their owners inside for hours, forgetting as <mark4>well</mark4><br>
as they can the miles, the circling plains, the still <mark4>town</mark4><br>
that connects to nothing but cold and space and a few   <br>
stray ribbons of pavement, icy guides to <mark4>nothing</mark4><br>
but bigger towns and other taverns that glitter and <mark4>wait:</mark4><br>
Denver, <mark4>Cheyenne.</mark4><br>
<br>
Hibernating in the library of the school on the <mark4>hill</mark4><br>
a few pieces by Thomas Aquinas or Saint Teresa <br>
and the fragmentary explorations of people like <mark4>Alfred</mark4><br>
North Whitehead crouch and wait amid research folders   <br>
on energy and military recruitment posters <mark4>glimpsed</mark4><br>
by the hard stars. The school bus by the door, a <mark4>yellow</mark4><br>
mound, clangs open and shut as the wind finds a loose   <br>
door and worries it all night, letting the <mark4>hollow</mark4><br>
students count off and break up and blow away   <br>
over the frozen <mark4>ground.</mark4><br>
