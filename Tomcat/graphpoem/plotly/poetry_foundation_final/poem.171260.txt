Title : The New World <br>
Author : Amiri Baraka <br><br>

The sun is folding, cars stall and <mark4>rise</mark4><br>
beyond the window. The workmen <mark4>leave</mark4><br>
the street to the bums and painters' <mark4>wives</mark4><br>
pushing their babies home. Those who <mark4>realize</mark4><br>
how fitful and indecent consciousness <mark4>is</mark4><br>
stare solemnly out on the emptying <mark4>street.</mark4><br>
The mourners and soft <mark4>singers</mark4>, The <mark4>liars,</mark4><br>
and seekers after ridiculous righteousness. <mark4>All</mark4><br>
my doubles, and friends, whose mistakes <mark4>cannot</mark4><br>
be duplicated by machines, and this is all of <mark4>our</mark4><br>
arrogance. Being broke or broken, <mark4>dribbling</mark4><br>
at the eyes. Wasted lyricists, and <mark4>men</mark4><br>
who have seen their dreams come true, only <mark4>seconds</mark4><br>
after they knew those dreams to be horrible conceits   <br>
and plastic fantasies of gesture and <mark4>extension,</mark4><br>
shoulders, hair and tongues distributing <mark4>misinformation</mark4><br>
about the nature of understanding. No one is that <mark4>simple</mark4><br>
or priggish, to be alone out of spite and grown <mark4>strong</mark4><br>
in its practice, mystics in two-pants suits. Our <mark4>style,</mark4><br>
and discipline, controlling the method of knowledge.   <br>
Beatniks, like Bohemians, go calmly out of style. And <mark4>boys</mark4><br>
are dying in Mexico, who did not get the word.   <br>
The lateness of their fabrication: mark their <mark4>holes</mark4><br>
with filthy needles. The lust of the world. This will <mark3>not</mark3><br>
be news. The simple damning <mark4>lust,</mark4><br>
float flat magic in low <mark4>changing</mark4><br>
<mark4>evenings</mark4>, Shiver your <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
in dance. Empty all of me <mark4>for</mark4><br>
knowing, and will the <mark4>danger</mark4><br>
of <mark3>identification,</mark3><br>
<br>
Let me sit and go blind in my <mark4>dreaming</mark4><br>
                           and be that dream in purpose and device. <br>
<br>
A fantasy of defeat, a strong strong <mark4>man</mark4><br>
older, but no wiser than the defect of <mark4>love.</mark4><br>
