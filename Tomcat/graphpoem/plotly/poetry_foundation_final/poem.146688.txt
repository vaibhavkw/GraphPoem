Title : Out of Town <br>
Author : Piotr Sommer <br><br>

Years later, the water still <mark4>drips--</mark4><br>
there's no one to tighten the valve. <br>
It courses through old <mark4>pipes</mark4><br>
down to the septic <mark4>tank.</mark4><br>
<br>
Next morning in the <mark4>cellar</mark4><br>
I start the motor with a <mark4>stick.</mark4><br>
It shakes and rumbles, and <mark4>chirps--</mark4><br>
the switch is broken is all.   <br>
<br>
At night the water <mark4>arrives</mark4><br>
illegally, undergroundly, <br>
to the very grave where <br>
last spring parsley sprouted, <br>
<br>
and at the <mark4>foot</mark4>, beside <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
feral sorrel darkens <br>
tastily and <mark4>tartly</mark4><br>
like clandestine <mark4>sex.</mark4><br>
<br>
The motor lifts the <mark4>spirits</mark4><br>
and returns the night's <mark4>deductions.</mark4><br>
It's morning, I hum <mark4>softly--</mark4><br>
a stranger will replace me.   <br>
<br>
In the cellar a stream of <mark4>light</mark4><br>
rinses the window <mark4>grate,</mark4><br>
it pulses, strikes the <mark4>meter--</mark4><br>
I catch my rhythm on the <mark4>stairs.</mark4><br>
<br>
And for memory's sake I hum-- <br>
as I pass the septic <mark1>tank--</mark1><br>
a fluid, underground song <br>
about sorrel and a <mark4>stranger.</mark4><br>
