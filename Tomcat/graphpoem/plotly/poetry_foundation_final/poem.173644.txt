Title : The Chambered Nautilus <br>
Author : Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. <br><br>

This is the ship of pearl, which, poets <mark3>feign,</mark3><br>
Sails the unshadowed <mark3>main,--</mark3><br>
The venturous bark that <mark3>flings</mark3><br>
On the sweet summer wind its purpled <mark3>wings</mark3><br>
In gulfs enchanted, where the Siren <mark3>sings,</mark3><br>
And coral reefs lie <mark3>bare,</mark3><br>
Where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming <mark3>hair.</mark3><br>
<br>
Its webs of living gauze no more <mark3>unfurl;</mark3><br>
Wrecked is the ship of <mark3>pearl!</mark3><br>
And every chambered <mark4>cell,</mark4><br>
Where its dim dreaming life was wont to <mark3>dwell,</mark3><br>
As the frail tenant shaped his growing <mark3>shell,</mark3><br>
Before thee lies <mark3>revealed,--</mark3><br>
Its irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt <mark3>unsealed!</mark3><br>
<br>
Year after year beheld the silent <mark4>toil</mark4><br>
That spread his lustrous <mark3>coil;</mark3><br>
Still, as the spiral <mark3>grew,</mark3><br>
He left the past year's dwelling for the <mark3>new,</mark3><br>
Stole with soft step its shining archway <mark3>through,</mark3><br>
Built up its idle <mark4>door,</mark4><br>
Stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thanks for the heavenly message brought by <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
Child of the wandering <mark3>sea,</mark3><br>
Cast from her lap, <mark4>forlorn!</mark4><br>
From thy dead lips a clearer note is <mark3>born</mark3><br>
Than ever Triton blew from wreathed <mark3>horn!</mark3><br>
While on mine ear it <mark3>rings,</mark3><br>
Through the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that <mark1>sings:--</mark1><br>
<br>
Build thee more stately mansions, O my <mark4>soul,</mark4><br>
As the swift seasons <mark3>roll!</mark3><br>
Leave thy low-vaulted <mark3>past!</mark3><br>
Let each new temple, nobler than the <mark3>last,</mark3><br>
Shut thee from heaven with a dome more <mark3>vast,</mark3><br>
Till thou at length art <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
Leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting <mark1>sea!</mark1><br>
