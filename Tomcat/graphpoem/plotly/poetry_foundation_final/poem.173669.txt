Title : 'Thou art indeed just, Lord, if I contend' <br>
Author : Gerard Manley Hopkins <br><br>

Justus quidem tu es, Domine, si disputem tecum; verumtamen justa loquar ad te: Quare via impiorum prosperatur? &c. <br>
Thou art indeed just, <mark4>Lord</mark4>, if I <mark4>contend</mark4><br>
With thee; but, sir, so what I plead is <mark3>just.</mark3><br>
Why do sinners' ways prosper? and why <mark3>must</mark3><br>
Disappointment all I endeavour <mark3>end?</mark3><br>
Wert thou my enemy, O thou my <mark3>friend,</mark3><br>
How wouldst thou worse, I wonder, than thou <mark4>dost</mark4><br>
Defeat, thwart me? Oh, the sots and thralls of <mark4>lust</mark4><br>
Do in spare hours more thrive than I that <mark3>spend,</mark3><br>
Sir, life upon thy cause. See, banks and <mark3>brakes</mark3><br>
Now, leaved how thick! laced they are <mark3>again</mark3><br>
With fretty chervil, look, and fresh wind <mark3>shakes</mark3><br>
Them; birds build - but not I build; no, but <mark3>strain,</mark3><br>
Time's eunuch, and not breed one work that <mark3>wakes.</mark3><br>
Mine, O thou lord of life, send my roots <mark3>rain.</mark3><br>
