Title : The Truth the Dead Know <br>
Author : Anne Sexton <br><br>

For my mother, born March 1902, died March 1959 and my father, born February 1900, died June 1959<br>
Gone, I say and walk from <mark4>church,</mark4><br>
refusing the stiff procession to the <mark3>grave,</mark3><br>
letting the dead ride alone in the hearse.   <br>
It is June. I am tired of being <mark3>brave.</mark3><br>
<br>
We drive to the Cape. I <mark4>cultivate</mark4><br>
myself where the sun gutters from the <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
where the sea swings in like an iron <mark4>gate</mark4><br>
and we touch. In another country people <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
<br>
My darling, the wind falls in like <mark4>stones</mark4><br>
from the whitehearted water and when we <mark4>touch</mark4><br>
we enter touch entirely. No one's <mark3>alone.</mark3><br>
Men kill for this, or for as <mark3>much.</mark3><br>
<br>
And what of the dead? They lie without <mark4>shoes</mark4><br>
in their stone boats. They are more like <mark3>stone</mark3><br>
than the sea would be if it stopped. They <mark3>refuse</mark3><br>
to be blessed, throat, eye and knucklebone. <br>
