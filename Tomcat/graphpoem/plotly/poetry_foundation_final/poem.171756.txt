Title : Nocturne <br>
Author : Li-Young Lee <br><br>

That scraping of iron on iron when the <mark5>wind</mark5><br>
rises, what is it? Something the wind <mark4>won't</mark4><br>
quit <mark4>with</mark4>, but drags back and <mark4>forth.</mark4><br>
Sometimes faint, far, then suddenly, close, <mark4>just</mark4><br>
beyond the screened <mark4>door</mark4>, as if someone <mark4>there</mark4><br>
squats in the dark honing his wares <mark4>against</mark4><br>
my threshold. Half steel wire, half metal <mark5>wing,</mark5><br>
nothing and anything might make this <mark4>noise</mark4><br>
of saws and rasps, a creaking and <mark4>groaning</mark4><br>
of bone-growth, or body-death, marriages of <mark4>rust,</mark4><br>
or ore abraded. Tonight, something <mark4>bows</mark4><br>
that should not <mark4>bend</mark4>, Something stiffens that <mark4>should</mark4><br>
slide. Something, loose and not <mark4>right,</mark4><br>
rakes or forges itself all <mark3>night.</mark3><br>
