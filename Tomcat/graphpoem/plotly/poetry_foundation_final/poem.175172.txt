Title : To Rosa <br>
Author : Abraham Lincoln <br><br>

You are young, and I am <mark3>older;</mark3><br>
You are hopeful, I am <mark3>not--</mark3><br>
Enjoy life, ere it grow <mark3>colder--</mark3><br>
Pluck the roses ere they <mark3>rot.</mark3><br>
<br>
Teach your beau to heed the <mark3>lay--</mark3><br>
That sunshine soon is lost in <mark3>shade--</mark3><br>
That now's as good as any <mark3>day--</mark3><br>
To take thee, Rosa, ere she <mark3>fade.</mark3><br>
