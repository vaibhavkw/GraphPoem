Title : My Star <br>
Author : Robert Browning <br><br>

All that I <mark3>know</mark3><br>
Of a certain <mark3>star,</mark3><br>
Is, it can <mark3>throw</mark3><br>
(Like the angled <mark3>spar)</mark3><br>
Now a dart of <mark3>red,</mark3><br>
Now a dart of <mark3>blue,</mark3><br>
Till my friends have <mark3>said</mark3><br>
They would fain see, <mark3>too,</mark3><br>
My star that dartles the red and the <mark1>blue!</mark1><br>
<br>
Then it stops like a bird; like a flower, hangs furled:<br>
They must solace themselves with the Saturn above <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
What matter to me if their star is a <mark4>world?</mark4><br>
Mine has opened its soul to me; therefore I love <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
