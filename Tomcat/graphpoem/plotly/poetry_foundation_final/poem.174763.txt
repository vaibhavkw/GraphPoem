Title : The Ballad of Reading Gaol <br>
Author : Oscar Wilde <br><br>

<br>
He did not wear his scarlet <mark4>coat,</mark4><br>
For blood and wine are <mark3>red,</mark3><br>
And blood and wine were on his <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
When they found him with the <mark3>dead,</mark3><br>
The poor dead woman whom he <mark4>loved,</mark4><br>
And murdered in her <mark4>bed.</mark4><br>
<br>
He walked amongst the Trial <mark4>Men</mark4><br>
In a suit of shabby <mark3>gray;</mark3><br>
A cricket cap was on his <mark3>head,</mark3><br>
And his step seemed light and <mark3>gay;</mark3><br>
But I never saw a man who <mark4>looked</mark4><br>
So wistfully at the <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
<br>
I never saw a man who <mark1>looked</mark1><br>
With such a wistful <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
Upon that little tent of <mark1>blue</mark1><br>
Which prisoners call the <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
And at every drifting cloud that <mark4>went</mark4><br>
With sails of silver <mark3>by.</mark3><br>
<br>
I walked, with other souls in <mark4>pain,</mark4><br>
Within another <mark3>ring,</mark3><br>
And was wondering if the man had <mark4>done</mark4><br>
A great or little <mark3>thing,</mark3><br>
When a voice behind me whispered <mark3>low,</mark3><br>
"That fellow's got to <mark3>swing."</mark3><br>
<br>
Dear Christ! the very prison <mark4>walls</mark4><br>
Suddenly seemed to <mark3>reel,</mark3><br>
And the sky above my head <mark5>became</mark5><br>
Like a casque of scorching <mark3>steel;</mark3><br>
And, though I was a soul in <mark1>pain,</mark1><br>
My pain I could not <mark3>feel.</mark3><br>
<br>
I only knew what hunted <mark4>thought</mark4><br>
Quickened his step, and <mark3>why</mark3><br>
He looked upon the garish <mark1>day</mark1><br>
With such a wistful <mark1>eye;</mark1><br>
The man had killed the thing he <mark1>loved,</mark1><br>
And so he had to <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
<br>
Yet each man kills the thing he <mark4>loves,</mark4><br>
By each let this be <mark4>heard,</mark4><br>
Some do it with a bitter <mark5>look,</mark5><br>
Some with a flattering <mark3>word,</mark3><br>
The coward does it with a <mark4>kiss,</mark4><br>
The brave man with a <mark4>sword!</mark4><br>
<br>
Some kill their love when they are <mark4>young,</mark4><br>
And some when they are <mark4>old;</mark4><br>
Some strangle with the hands of <mark4>Lust,</mark4><br>
Some with the hands of <mark3>Gold:</mark3><br>
The kindest use a knife, <mark4>because</mark4><br>
The dead so soon grow <mark3>cold.</mark3><br>
<br>
Some love too little, some too <mark4>long,</mark4><br>
Some sell, and others <mark3>buy;</mark3><br>
Some do the deed with many <mark4>tears,</mark4><br>
And some without a <mark3>sigh:</mark3><br>
For each man kills the thing he <mark1>loves,</mark1><br>
Yet each man does not <mark1>die.</mark1><br>
<br>
He does not die a death of <mark3>shame</mark3><br>
On a day of dark <mark4>disgrace,</mark4><br>
Nor have a noose about his <mark4>neck,</mark4><br>
Nor a cloth upon his <mark3>face,</mark3><br>
Nor drop feet foremost through the <mark3>floor</mark3><br>
Into an empty <mark3>space.</mark3><br>
<br>
He does not sit with silent <mark1>men</mark1><br>
Who watch him night and <mark1>day;</mark1><br>
Who watch him when he tries to <mark4>weep,</mark4><br>
And when he tries to <mark3>pray;</mark3><br>
Who watch him lest himself should <mark1>rob</mark1><br>
The prison of its <mark2>prey.</mark2><br>
<br>
He does not wake at dawn to <mark3>see</mark3><br>
Dread figures throng his <mark4>room,</mark4><br>
The shivering Chaplain robed in <mark4>white,</mark4><br>
The Sheriff stern with <mark3>gloom,</mark3><br>
And the Governor all in shiny <mark4>black,</mark4><br>
With the yellow face of <mark3>Doom.</mark3><br>
<br>
He does not rise in piteous <mark4>haste</mark4><br>
To put on <mark4>convict-clothes,</mark4><br>
While some coarse-mouthed Doctor <mark3>gloats</mark3>, and <mark4>notes</mark4><br>
Each new and nerve-twitched <mark3>pose,</mark3><br>
Fingering a watch whose little <mark4>ticks</mark4><br>
Are like horrible <mark3>hammer-blows.</mark3><br>
<br>
He does not know that sickening <mark4>thirst</mark4><br>
That sands one's throat, <mark3>before</mark3><br>
The hangman with his gardener's <mark4>gloves</mark4><br>
Slips through the padded <mark3>door,</mark3><br>
And binds one with three leathern <mark5>thongs,</mark5><br>
That the throat may thirst no <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
<br>
He does not bend his head to <mark4>hear</mark4><br>
The Burial Office <mark4>read,</mark4><br>
Nor while the terror of his <mark4>soul</mark4><br>
Tells him he is not <mark1>dead,</mark1><br>
Cross his own coffin, as he <mark4>moves</mark4><br>
Into the hideous <mark3>shed.</mark3><br>
<br>
He does not stare upon the <mark4>air</mark4><br>
Through a little roof of <mark4>glass:</mark4><br>
He does not pray with lips of <mark3>clay</mark3><br>
For his agony to <mark3>pass;</mark3><br>
Nor feel upon his shuddering <mark4>cheek</mark4><br>
The kiss of <mark5>Caiaphas.</mark5><br>
<br>
Six weeks the guardsman walked the <mark4>yard,</mark4><br>
In the suit of shabby <mark1>gray:</mark1><br>
His cricket cap was on his <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
And his step seemed light and <mark1>gay,</mark1><br>
But I never saw a man who <mark1>looked</mark1><br>
So wistfully at the <mark1>day.</mark1><br>
I never saw a man who <mark1>looked</mark1><br>
<br>
With such a wistful <mark1>eye</mark1><br>
Upon that little tent of <mark1>blue</mark1><br>
Which prisoners call the <mark1>sky,</mark1><br>
And at every wandering cloud that <mark4>trailed</mark4><br>
Its ravelled fleeces <mark1>by.</mark1><br>
He did not wring his hands, as <mark3>do</mark3><br>
<br>
Those witless men who <mark3>dare</mark3><br>
To try to rear the changeling <mark4>Hope</mark4><br>
In the cave of black <mark3>Despair:</mark3><br>
He only looked upon the <mark4>sun,</mark4><br>
And drank the morning <mark1>air.</mark1><br>
He did not wring his hands nor <mark1>weep,</mark1><br>
<br>
Nor did he peek or <mark4>pine,</mark4><br>
But he drank the air as though it <mark4>held</mark4><br>
      Some healthful anodyne;<br>
With open mouth he drank the <mark1>sun</mark1><br>
As though it had been <mark4>wine!</mark4><br>
And I and all the souls in <mark1>pain,</mark1><br>
<br>
Who tramped the other <mark1>ring,</mark1><br>
Forgot if we ourselves had <mark1>done</mark1><br>
A great or little <mark1>thing,</mark1><br>
And watched with gaze of dull <mark4>amaze</mark4><br>
The man who had to <mark1>swing.</mark1><br>
For strange it was to see him <mark1>pass</mark1><br>
<br>
With a step so light and <mark1>gay,</mark1><br>
And strange it was to see him <mark1>look</mark1><br>
So wistfully at the <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
And strange it was to think that <mark3>he</mark3><br>
Had such a debt to <mark3>pay.</mark3><br>
For oak and elm have pleasant <mark4>leaves</mark4><br>
<br>
That in the spring-time <mark4>shoot:</mark4><br>
But grim to see is the <mark3>gallows-tree,</mark3><br>
With its alder-bitten <mark3>root,</mark3><br>
And, green or <mark3>dry</mark3>, a man must <mark1>die</mark1><br>
Before it bears its <mark3>fruit!</mark3><br>
The loftiest place is that seat of <mark4>grace</mark4><br>
<br>
For which all worldlings <mark3>try:</mark3><br>
But who would stand in hempen <mark4>band</mark4><br>
Upon a scaffold <mark3>high,</mark3><br>
And through a murderer's collar <mark4>take</mark4><br>
His last look at the <mark1>sky?</mark1><br>
It is sweet to dance to <mark4>violins</mark4><br>
<br>
When Love and Life are <mark3>fair:</mark3><br>
To dance to <mark3>flutes</mark3>, to dance to <mark4>lutes</mark4><br>
Is delicate and <mark3>rare:</mark3><br>
But it is not sweet with nimble <mark4>feet</mark4><br>
To dance upon the <mark1>air!</mark1><br>
So with curious eyes and sick <mark4>surmise</mark4><br>
<br>
We watched him day by <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
And wondered if each one of <mark4>us</mark4><br>
Would end the self-same <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
For none can tell to what red <mark4>Hell</mark4><br>
His sightless soul may <mark3>stray.</mark3><br>
At last the dead man walked no <mark1>more</mark1><br>
<br>
Amongst the Trial <mark1>Men,</mark1><br>
And I knew that he was standing <mark4>up</mark4><br>
In the black dock's dreadful <mark3>pen,</mark3><br>
And that never would I see his <mark1>face</mark1><br>
In God's sweet world <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
Like two doomed ships that pass in <mark4>storm</mark4><br>
<br>
We had crossed each other's <mark1>way:</mark1><br>
But we made no sign, we said no <mark1>word,</mark1><br>
We had no word to <mark3>say;</mark3><br>
For we did not meet in the holy <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
But in the shameful <mark1>day.</mark1><br>
A prison wall was round us <mark4>both,</mark4><br>
<br>
Two outcast men we <mark1>were:</mark1><br>
The world had thrust us from its <mark4>heart,</mark4><br>
And God from out His <mark4>care:</mark4><br>
And the iron gin that waits for <mark4>Sin</mark4><br>
Had caught us in its <mark3>snare.</mark3><br>
In Debtors' Yard the stones are <mark4>hard,</mark4><br>
<br>
And the dripping wall is <mark1>high,</mark1><br>
So it was there he took the <mark1>air</mark1><br>
Beneath the leaden <mark1>sky,</mark1><br>
And by each side a Warder <mark4>walked,</mark4><br>
For fear the man might <mark1>die.</mark1><br>
Or else he sat with those who <mark4>watched</mark4><br>
His anguish night and <mark1>day;</mark1><br>
<br>
Who watched him when he rose to <mark1>weep,</mark1><br>
And when he crouched to <mark1>pray;</mark1><br>
Who watched him lest himself should <mark1>rob</mark1><br>
Their scaffold of its <mark1>prey.</mark1><br>
The Governor was strong <mark4>upon</mark4><br>
The Regulations <mark4>Act:</mark4><br>
<br>
The Doctor said that Death was <mark4>but</mark4><br>
A scientific <mark4>fact:</mark4><br>
And twice a day the Chaplain <mark4>called,</mark4><br>
And left a little <mark3>tract.</mark3><br>
And twice a day he smoked his <mark4>pipe,</mark4><br>
And drank his quart of <mark4>beer:</mark4><br>
<br>
His soul was resolute, and <mark1>held</mark1><br>
No hiding-place for <mark3>fear;</mark3><br>
He often said that he was <mark4>glad</mark4><br>
The hangman's hands were <mark3>near.</mark3><br>
But why he said so strange a <mark1>thing</mark1><br>
No Warder dared to <mark4>ask:</mark4><br>
<br>
For he to whom a watcher's <mark1>doom</mark1><br>
Is given as his <mark3>task,</mark3><br>
Must set a lock upon his <mark4>lips,</mark4><br>
And make his face a <mark3>mask.</mark3><br>
Or else he might be moved, and <mark1>try</mark1><br>
To comfort or <mark4>console:</mark4><br>
<br>
And what should Human Pity <mark1>do</mark1><br>
Pent up in Murderer's <mark3>Hole?</mark3><br>
What word of grace in such a <mark4>place</mark4><br>
Could help a brother's <mark1>soul?</mark1><br>
With slouch and swing around the <mark1>ring</mark1><br>
We trod the Fools' <mark4>Parade!</mark4><br>
<br>
We did not care: we knew we <mark1>were</mark1><br>
The Devil's Own <mark3>Brigade:</mark3><br>
And shaven head and feet of <mark4>lead</mark4><br>
Make a merry <mark4>masquerade.</mark4><br>
We tore the tarry rope to <mark4>shreds</mark4><br>
With blunt and bleeding <mark4>nails;</mark4><br>
<br>
We rubbed the <mark3>doors</mark3>, and scrubbed the <mark4>floors,</mark4><br>
And cleaned the shining <mark4>rails:</mark4><br>
And, rank by <mark3>rank</mark3>, we soaped the <mark4>plank,</mark4><br>
And clattered with the <mark3>pails.</mark3><br>
We sewed the sacks, we broke the <mark4>stones,</mark4><br>
We turned the dusty <mark4>drill:</mark4><br>
<br>
We banged the <mark4>tins</mark4>, and bawled the <mark4>hymns,</mark4><br>
And sweated on the <mark3>mill:</mark3><br>
But in the heart of every <mark4>man</mark4><br>
Terror was lying <mark3>still.</mark3><br>
So still it lay that every <mark1>day</mark1><br>
Crawled like a weed-clogged <mark3>wave:</mark3><br>
<br>
And we forgot the bitter <mark4>lot</mark4><br>
That waits for fool and <mark3>knave,</mark3><br>
Till once, as we tramped in from <mark4>work,</mark4><br>
We passed an open <mark3>grave.</mark3><br>
With yawning mouth the yellow <mark1>hole</mark1><br>
Gaped for a living <mark1>thing;</mark1><br>
<br>
The very mud cried out for <mark4>blood</mark4><br>
To the thirsty asphalte <mark1>ring:</mark1><br>
And we knew that ere one dawn grew <mark1>fair</mark1><br>
Some prisoner had to <mark1>swing.</mark1><br>
Right in we <mark3>went</mark3>, with soul <mark4>intent</mark4><br>
On Death and Dread and <mark1>Doom:</mark1><br>
<br>
The hangman, with his little bag,<br>
Went shuffling through the <mark1>gloom:</mark1><br>
And each man trembled as he <mark4>crept</mark4><br>
Into his numbered <mark3>tomb.</mark3><br>
That night the empty <mark4>corridors</mark4><br>
Were full of forms of <mark1>Fear,</mark1><br>
<br>
And up and down the iron <mark4>town</mark4><br>
Stole feet we could not <mark1>hear,</mark1><br>
And through the bars that hide the <mark4>stars</mark4><br>
White faces seemed to <mark4>peer.</mark4><br>
He lay as one who lies and <mark4>dreams</mark4><br>
In a pleasant <mark4>meadow-land,</mark4><br>
<br>
The watchers watched him as he <mark3>slept,</mark3><br>
And could not <mark3>understand</mark3><br>
How one could sleep so sweet a <mark4>sleep</mark4><br>
With a hangman close at <mark3>hand.</mark3><br>
But there is no sleep when men must <mark1>weep</mark1><br>
Who never yet have <mark3>wept:</mark3><br>
<br>
So we?the fool, the fraud, the <mark1>knave?</mark1><br>
That endless vigil <mark3>kept,</mark3><br>
And through each brain on hands of <mark1>pain</mark1><br>
Another's terror <mark1>crept.</mark1><br>
Alas! it is a fearful <mark1>thing</mark1><br>
To feel another's <mark4>guilt!</mark4><br>
<br>
For, right <mark3>within</mark3>, the sword of <mark1>Sin</mark1><br>
Pierced to its poisoned <mark3>hilt,</mark3><br>
And as molten lead were the tears we <mark1>shed</mark1><br>
For the blood we had not <mark3>spilt.</mark3><br>
The Warders with their shoes of <mark4>felt</mark4><br>
Crept by each padlocked <mark1>door,</mark1><br>
<br>
And peeped and <mark3>saw</mark3>, with eyes of <mark3>awe,</mark3><br>
Gray figures on the <mark1>floor,</mark1><br>
And wondered why men knelt to <mark1>pray</mark1><br>
Who never prayed <mark1>before.</mark1><br>
All through the night we knelt and <mark4>prayed,</mark4><br>
Mad mourners of a <mark4>corse!</mark4><br>
<br>
The troubled plumes of midnight <mark1>were</mark1><br>
The plumes upon a <mark4>hearse:</mark4><br>
And bitter wine upon a <mark5>sponge</mark5><br>
Was the savour of <mark4>Remorse.</mark4><br>
The gray cock <mark1>crew</mark1>, the red cock <mark3>crew,</mark3><br>
But never came the <mark1>day:</mark1><br>
<br>
And crooked shapes of Terror <mark4>crouched,</mark4><br>
In the corners where we <mark3>lay:</mark3><br>
And each evil sprite that walks by <mark1>night</mark1><br>
Before us seemed to <mark3>play.</mark3><br>
They glided <mark3>past</mark3>, they glided <mark4>fast,</mark4><br>
Like travellers through a <mark4>mist:</mark4><br>
<br>
They mocked the moon in a <mark5>rigadoon</mark5><br>
Of delicate turn and <mark3>twist,</mark3><br>
And with formal pace and loathsome <mark1>grace</mark1><br>
The phantoms kept their <mark3>tryst.</mark3><br>
With mop and <mark3>mow</mark3>, we saw them <mark3>go,</mark3><br>
Slim shadows hand in <mark1>hand:</mark1><br>
<br>
About, <mark3>about</mark3>, in ghostly <mark4>rout</mark4><br>
      They trod a saraband:<br>
And damned grotesques made arabesques,<br>
Like the wind upon the <mark3>sand!</mark3><br>
With the pirouettes of <mark5>marionettes,</mark5><br>
They tripped on pointed <mark4>tread:</mark4><br>
<br>
But with flutes of Fear they filled the <mark4>ear,</mark4><br>
As their grisly masque they <mark3>led,</mark3><br>
And loud they <mark1>sang</mark1>, and long they <mark4>sang,</mark4><br>
For they sang to wake the <mark1>dead.</mark1><br>
"Oho!" they <mark3>cried</mark3>, "the world is <mark4>wide,</mark4><br>
But fettered limbs go <mark4>lame!</mark4><br>
<br>
And once, or <mark3>twice</mark3>, to throw the <mark4>dice</mark4><br>
Is a gentlemanly <mark3>game,</mark3><br>
But he does not win who plays with <mark1>Sin</mark1><br>
In the Secret House of <mark1>Shame."</mark1><br>
No things of air these antics <mark1>were,</mark1><br>
That frolicked with such <mark3>glee:</mark3><br>
<br>
To men whose lives were held in gyves,<br>
And whose feet might not go <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living <mark4>things,</mark4><br>
Most terrible to <mark1>see.</mark1><br>
Around, <mark3>around</mark3>, they waltzed and <mark4>wound;</mark4><br>
Some wheeled in smirking <mark4>pairs;</mark4><br>
<br>
With the mincing step of a demirep<br>
Some sidled up the <mark3>stairs:</mark3><br>
And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,<br>
Each helped us at our <mark3>prayers.</mark3><br>
The morning wind began to <mark4>moan,</mark4><br>
But still the night went <mark4>on:</mark4><br>
<br>
Through its giant loom the web of <mark1>gloom</mark1><br>
Crept till each thread was <mark4>spun:</mark4><br>
And, as we <mark3>prayed</mark3>, we grew <mark4>afraid</mark4><br>
Of the Justice of the <mark1>Sun.</mark1><br>
The moaning wind went wandering <mark4>round</mark4><br>
The weeping <mark4>prison-wall:</mark4><br>
<br>
Till like a wheel of turning <mark1>steel</mark1><br>
We felt the minutes <mark4>crawl:</mark4><br>
O moaning wind! what had we <mark1>done</mark1><br>
      To have such a seneschal?<br>
At last I saw the shadowed <mark4>bars,</mark4><br>
Like a lattice wrought in <mark1>lead,</mark1><br>
<br>
Move right across the whitewashed <mark3>wall</mark3><br>
That faced my three-plank <mark1>bed,</mark1><br>
And I knew that somewhere in the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
God's dreadful dawn was <mark1>red.</mark1><br>
At six o'clock we cleaned our <mark4>cells,</mark4><br>
At seven all was <mark1>still,</mark1><br>
<br>
But the sough and swing of a mighty <mark4>wing</mark4><br>
The prison seemed to <mark3>fill,</mark3><br>
For the Lord of Death with icy <mark4>breath</mark4><br>
Had entered in to <mark3>kill.</mark3><br>
He did not pass in purple <mark4>pomp,</mark4><br>
Nor ride a moon-white <mark4>steed.</mark4><br>
<br>
Three yards of cord and a sliding <mark4>board</mark4><br>
Are all the gallows' <mark4>need:</mark4><br>
So with rope of shame the Herald <mark4>came</mark4><br>
To do the secret <mark3>deed.</mark3><br>
We were as men who through a <mark4>fen</mark4><br>
Of filthy darkness <mark4>grope:</mark4><br>
<br>
We did not dare to breathe a <mark4>prayer,</mark4><br>
Or to give our anguish <mark3>scope:</mark3><br>
Something was dead in each of <mark1>us,</mark1><br>
And what was dead was <mark1>Hope.</mark1><br>
For Man's grim Justice goes its <mark1>way</mark1><br>
And will not swerve <mark4>aside:</mark4><br>
<br>
It slays the weak, it slays the <mark4>strong,</mark4><br>
It has a deadly <mark3>stride:</mark3><br>
With iron heel it slays the <mark1>strong,</mark1><br>
      The monstrous parricide!<br>
We waited for the stroke of <mark4>eight:</mark4><br>
Each tongue was thick with <mark1>thirst:</mark1><br>
<br>
For the stroke of eight is the stroke of <mark4>Fate</mark4><br>
      That makes a man accursed,<br>
And Fate will use a running <mark4>noose</mark4><br>
For the best man and the <mark4>worst.</mark4><br>
We had no other thing to <mark1>do,</mark1><br>
Save to wait for the sign to <mark4>come:</mark4><br>
<br>
So, like things of stone in a valley <mark4>lone,</mark4><br>
Quiet we sat and <mark3>dumb:</mark3><br>
But each man's heart beat thick and <mark4>quick,</mark4><br>
Like a madman on a <mark3>drum!</mark3><br>
With sudden shock the <mark4>prison-clock</mark4><br>
Smote on the shivering <mark1>air,</mark1><br>
<br>
And from all the gaol rose up a <mark4>wail</mark4><br>
Of impotent <mark1>despair,</mark1><br>
Like the sound the frightened marshes <mark1>hear</mark1><br>
From some leper in his <mark4>lair.</mark4><br>
And as one sees most fearful <mark1>things</mark1><br>
In the crystal of a <mark4>dream,</mark4><br>
<br>
We saw the greasy hempen <mark3>rope</mark3><br>
Hooked to the blackened <mark3>beam,</mark3><br>
And heard the prayer the hangman's <mark1>snare</mark1><br>
Strangled into a <mark3>scream.</mark3><br>
And all the woe that moved him <mark3>so</mark3><br>
That he gave that bitter <mark3>cry,</mark3><br>
<br>
And the wild <mark3>regrets</mark3>, and the bloody <mark4>sweats,</mark4><br>
None knew so well as <mark3>I:</mark3><br>
For he who lives more lives than <mark4>one</mark4><br>
More deaths than one must <mark1>die.</mark1><br>
There is no chapel on the <mark1>day</mark1><br>
On which they hang a <mark1>man:</mark1><br>
<br>
The Chaplain's heart is far too <mark4>sick,</mark4><br>
Or his face is far too <mark4>wan,</mark4><br>
Or there is that written in his <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
Which none should look <mark1>upon.</mark1><br>
So they kept us close till nigh on <mark4>noon,</mark4><br>
And then they rang the <mark4>bell,</mark4><br>
And the Warders with their jingling <mark4>keys</mark4><br>
<br>
Opened each listening <mark3>cell,</mark3><br>
And down the iron stair we <mark4>tramped,</mark4><br>
Each from his separate <mark1>Hell.</mark1><br>
Out into God's sweet air we <mark1>went,</mark1><br>
But not in wonted <mark1>way,</mark1><br>
For this man's face was white with <mark1>fear,</mark1><br>
<br>
And that man's face was <mark1>gray,</mark1><br>
And I never saw sad men who <mark1>looked</mark1><br>
So wistfully at the <mark1>day.</mark1><br>
I never saw sad men who <mark1>looked</mark1><br>
With such a wistful <mark1>eye</mark1><br>
Upon that little tent of <mark1>blue</mark1><br>
<br>
We prisoners called the <mark1>sky,</mark1><br>
And at every careless cloud that <mark4>passed</mark4><br>
In happy freedom <mark1>by.</mark1><br>
But there were those amongst us <mark4>all</mark4><br>
Who walked with downcast <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
And knew that, had each got his <mark3>due,</mark3><br>
<br>
They should have died <mark3>instead:</mark3><br>
He had but killed a thing that <mark4>lived,</mark4><br>
Whilst they had killed the <mark1>dead.</mark1><br>
For he who sins a second <mark4>time</mark4><br>
Wakes a dead soul to <mark1>pain,</mark1><br>
And draws it from its spotted <mark4>shroud,</mark4><br>
<br>
And makes it bleed <mark1>again,</mark1><br>
And makes it bleed great gouts of <mark1>blood,</mark1><br>
And makes it bleed in <mark3>vain!</mark3><br>
Like ape or clown, in monstrous <mark4>garb</mark4><br>
With crooked arrows <mark4>starred,</mark4><br>
Silently we went round and <mark1>round</mark1><br>
<br>
The slippery asphalte <mark1>yard;</mark1><br>
Silently we went round and <mark1>round,</mark1><br>
And no man spoke a <mark1>word.</mark1><br>
Silently we went round and <mark1>round,</mark1><br>
And through each hollow <mark4>mind</mark4><br>
The Memory of dreadful <mark1>things</mark1><br>
<br>
Rushed like a dreadful <mark3>wind,</mark3><br>
And Horror stalked before each <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
And Terror crept <mark3>behind.</mark3><br>
The Warders strutted up and <mark4>down,</mark4><br>
      And kept their herd of brutes,<br>
Their uniforms were spick and <mark4>span,</mark4><br>
<br>
And they wore their Sunday <mark4>suits,</mark4><br>
But we knew the work they had been <mark4>at,</mark4><br>
By the quicklime on their <mark3>boots.</mark3><br>
For where a grave had opened <mark1>wide,</mark1><br>
There was no grave at <mark1>all:</mark1><br>
Only a stretch of mud and <mark1>sand</mark1><br>
<br>
By the hideous <mark1>prison-wall,</mark1><br>
And a little heap of burning <mark3>lime,</mark3><br>
That the man should have his <mark3>pall.</mark3><br>
For he has a pall, this wretched <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
Such as few men can <mark4>claim:</mark4><br>
Deep down below a <mark4>prison-yard,</mark4><br>
<br>
Naked for greater <mark1>shame,</mark1><br>
He lies, with fetters on each <mark4>foot,</mark4><br>
Wrapt in a sheet of <mark3>flame!</mark3><br>
And all the while the burning <mark1>lime</mark1><br>
Eats flesh and bone <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
It eats the brittle bone by <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
<br>
And the soft flesh by <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
It eats the flesh and bone by <mark4>turns,</mark4><br>
      But it eats the heart alway.<br>
For three long years they will not <mark2>sow</mark2><br>
Or root or seedling <mark4>there:</mark4><br>
For three long years the unblessed <mark4>spot</mark4><br>
<br>
Will sterile be and <mark3>bare,</mark3><br>
And look upon the wondering <mark1>sky</mark1><br>
With unreproachful <mark3>stare.</mark3><br>
They think a murderer's heart would <mark4>taint</mark4><br>
Each simple seed they <mark1>sow.</mark1><br>
It is not true! God's kindly <mark4>earth</mark4><br>
<br>
Is kindlier than men <mark3>know,</mark3><br>
And the red rose would but glow more <mark1>red,</mark1><br>
The white rose whiter <mark3>blow.</mark3><br>
Out of his mouth a red, red <mark4>rose!</mark4><br>
Out of his heart a <mark1>white!</mark1><br>
For who can say by what strange <mark1>way,</mark1><br>
<br>
Christ brings His will to <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
Since the barren staff the pilgrim <mark4>bore</mark4><br>
Bloomed in the great Pope's <mark3>sight?</mark3><br>
But neither milk-white rose nor <mark1>red</mark1><br>
May bloom in prison <mark1>air;</mark1><br>
The shard, the pebble, and the <mark4>flint,</mark4><br>
<br>
Are what they give us <mark1>there:</mark1><br>
For flowers have been known to <mark4>heal</mark4><br>
A common man's <mark1>despair.</mark1><br>
So never will wine-red rose or <mark1>white,</mark1><br>
Petal by <mark4>petal</mark4>, <mark4>fall</mark4><br>
On that stretch of mud and sand that <mark4>lies</mark4><br>
<br>
By the hideous <mark1>prison-wall,</mark1><br>
To tell the men who tramp the <mark1>yard</mark1><br>
That God's Son died for <mark1>all.</mark1><br>
Yet though the hideous <mark1>prison-wall</mark1><br>
Still hems him round and <mark1>round,</mark1><br>
And a spirit may not walk by <mark1>night</mark1><br>
<br>
That is with fetters <mark3>bound,</mark3><br>
And a spirit may but weep that <mark1>lies</mark1><br>
In such unholy <mark3>ground,</mark3><br>
He is at peace?this wretched <mark1>man?</mark1><br>
At peace, or will be <mark4>soon:</mark4><br>
There is no thing to make him <mark4>mad,</mark4><br>
<br>
Nor does Terror walk at <mark1>noon,</mark1><br>
For the lampless Earth in which he <mark1>lies</mark1><br>
Has neither Sun nor <mark3>Moon.</mark3><br>
They hanged him as a beast is <mark4>hanged:</mark4><br>
They did not even <mark4>toll</mark4><br>
A requiem that might have <mark4>brought</mark4><br>
<br>
Rest to his startled <mark1>soul,</mark1><br>
But hurriedly they took him <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
And hid him in a <mark1>hole.</mark1><br>
They stripped him of his canvas <mark4>clothes,</mark4><br>
And gave him to the <mark4>flies:</mark4><br>
They mocked the swollen purple <mark4>throat,</mark4><br>
<br>
And the stark and staring <mark1>eyes:</mark1><br>
And with laughter loud they heaped the <mark1>shroud</mark1><br>
In which their convict <mark1>lies.</mark1><br>
The Chaplain would not kneel to <mark1>pray</mark1><br>
By his dishonoured <mark1>grave:</mark1><br>
Nor mark it with that blessed <mark4>Cross</mark4><br>
<br>
That Christ for sinners <mark3>gave,</mark3><br>
Because the man was one of <mark4>those</mark4><br>
Whom Christ came down to <mark3>save.</mark3><br>
Yet all is well; he has but <mark1>passed</mark1><br>
To Life's appointed <mark4>bourne:</mark4><br>
And alien tears will fill for <mark4>him</mark4><br>
<br>
Pity's long-broken <mark4>urn,</mark4><br>
For his mourners will be outcast <mark1>men,</mark1><br>
And outcasts always <mark4>mourn.</mark4><br>
I know not whether Laws be <mark4>right,</mark4><br>
Or whether Laws be <mark3>wrong;</mark3><br>
All that we know who lie in gaol<br>
<br>
Is that the wall is <mark1>strong;</mark1><br>
And that each day is like a <mark4>year,</mark4><br>
A year whose days are <mark1>long.</mark1><br>
But this I know, that every <mark3>Law</mark3><br>
That men have made for <mark1>Man,</mark1><br>
Since first Man took his brother's <mark4>life,</mark4><br>
And the sad world <mark3>began,</mark3><br>
<br>
But straws the wheat and saves the <mark4>chaff</mark4><br>
With a most evil <mark3>fan.</mark3><br>
This too I know?and wise it <mark1>were</mark1><br>
If each could know the <mark4>same?</mark4><br>
That every prison that men <mark4>build</mark4><br>
Is built with bricks of <mark1>shame,</mark1><br>
<br>
And bound with bars lest Christ should <mark1>see</mark1><br>
How men their brothers <mark3>maim.</mark3><br>
With bars they blur the gracious <mark1>moon,</mark1><br>
And blind the goodly <mark1>sun:</mark1><br>
And they do well to hide their <mark1>Hell,</mark1><br>
For in it things are <mark1>done</mark1><br>
<br>
That Son of God nor son of <mark1>Man</mark1><br>
Ever should look <mark1>upon!</mark1><br>
The vilest deeds like poison <mark4>weeds</mark4><br>
Bloom well in <mark4>prison-air:</mark4><br>
It is only what is good in <mark1>Man</mark1><br>
That wastes and withers <mark1>there:</mark1><br>
<br>
Pale Anguish keeps the heavy <mark4>gate,</mark4><br>
And the Warder is <mark1>Despair.</mark1><br>
For they starve the little frightened <mark4>child</mark4><br>
Till it weeps both night and <mark1>day:</mark1><br>
And they scourge the weak, and flog the <mark4>fool,</mark4><br>
And gibe the old and <mark1>gray,</mark1><br>
<br>
And some grow <mark3>mad</mark3>, and all grow <mark4>bad,</mark4><br>
And none a word may <mark1>say.</mark1><br>
Each narrow cell in which we <mark4>dwell</mark4><br>
Is a foul and dark <mark4>latrine,</mark4><br>
And the fetid breath of living <mark4>Death</mark4><br>
Chokes up each grated <mark3>screen,</mark3><br>
<br>
And all, but <mark3>Lust</mark3>, is turned to <mark4>dust</mark4><br>
In Humanity's <mark3>machine.</mark3><br>
The brackish water that we <mark4>drink</mark4><br>
Creeps with a loathsome <mark4>slime,</mark4><br>
And the bitter bread they weigh in <mark4>scales</mark4><br>
Is full of chalk and <mark1>lime,</mark1><br>
<br>
And Sleep will not lie down, but <mark4>walks</mark4><br>
Wild-eyed, and cries to <mark1>Time.</mark1><br>
But though lean Hunger and green <mark1>Thirst</mark1><br>
Like asp with adder <mark4>fight,</mark4><br>
We have little care of prison <mark3>fare,</mark3><br>
For what chills and kills <mark3>outright</mark3><br>
<br>
Is that every stone one lifts by <mark1>day</mark1><br>
Becomes one's heart by <mark1>night.</mark1><br>
With midnight always in one's <mark1>heart,</mark1><br>
And twilight in one's <mark1>cell,</mark1><br>
We turn the crank, or tear the <mark1>rope,</mark1><br>
Each in his separate <mark1>Hell,</mark1><br>
<br>
And the silence is more awful <mark4>far</mark4><br>
Than the sound of a brazen <mark1>bell.</mark1><br>
And never a human voice comes <mark1>near</mark1><br>
To speak a gentle <mark1>word:</mark1><br>
And the eye that watches through the <mark1>door</mark1><br>
Is pitiless and <mark1>hard:</mark1><br>
<br>
And by all <mark3>forgot</mark3>, we rot and <mark4>rot,</mark4><br>
With soul and body <mark3>marred.</mark3><br>
And thus we rust Life's iron <mark4>chain</mark4><br>
Degraded and <mark4>alone:</mark4><br>
And some men curse, and some men <mark1>weep,</mark1><br>
And some men make no <mark1>moan:</mark1><br>
<br>
But God's eternal Laws are <mark4>kind</mark4><br>
And break the heart of <mark3>stone.</mark3><br>
And every human heart that <mark4>breaks,</mark4><br>
In prison-cell or <mark1>yard,</mark1><br>
Is as that broken box that <mark1>gave</mark1><br>
Its treasure to the <mark4>Lord,</mark4><br>
<br>
And filled the unclean leper's <mark4>house</mark4><br>
With the scent of costliest <mark4>nard.</mark4><br>
Ah! happy they whose hearts can <mark4>break</mark4><br>
And peace of pardon <mark4>win!</mark4><br>
How else may man make straight his <mark4>plan</mark4><br>
And cleanse his soul from <mark1>Sin?</mark1><br>
<br>
How else but through a broken <mark1>heart</mark1><br>
May Lord Christ enter <mark3>in?</mark3><br>
And he of the swollen purple <mark1>throat,</mark1><br>
And the stark and staring <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
Waits for the holy hands that <mark4>took</mark4><br>
The Thief to <mark4>Paradise;</mark4><br>
<br>
And a broken and a contrite <mark1>heart</mark1><br>
The Lord will not <mark3>despise.</mark3><br>
The man in red who reads the <mark1>Law</mark1><br>
Gave him three weeks of <mark1>life,</mark1><br>
Three little weeks in which to <mark1>heal</mark1><br>
His soul of his soul's <mark3>strife,</mark3><br>
<br>
And cleanse from every blot of <mark1>blood</mark1><br>
The hand that held the <mark3>knife.</mark3><br>
And with tears of blood he cleansed the <mark1>hand,</mark1><br>
The hand that held the <mark1>steel:</mark1><br>
For only blood can wipe out <mark1>blood,</mark1><br>
And only tears can <mark1>heal:</mark1><br>
<br>
And the crimson stain that was of <mark4>Cain</mark4><br>
Became Christ's snow-white <mark3>seal.</mark3><br>
In Reading gaol by Reading <mark1>town</mark1><br>
There is a pit of <mark1>shame,</mark1><br>
And in it lies a wretched <mark1>man</mark1><br>
Eaten by teeth of <mark1>flame,</mark1><br>
<br>
In a burning winding-sheet he <mark1>lies,</mark1><br>
And his grave has got no <mark3>name.</mark3><br>
And there, till Christ call forth the <mark1>dead,</mark1><br>
In silence let him <mark3>lie:</mark3><br>
No need to waste the foolish <mark4>tear,</mark4><br>
Or heave the windy <mark1>sigh:</mark1><br>
The man had killed the thing he <mark1>loved,</mark1><br>
<br>
And so he had to <mark1>die.</mark1><br>
And all men kill the thing they <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
By all let this be <mark1>heard,</mark1><br>
Some do it with a bitter <mark1>look,</mark1><br>
Some with a flattering <mark1>word,</mark1><br>
The coward does it with a <mark1>kiss,</mark1><br>
<br>
The brave man with a <mark1>sword.</mark1><br>
