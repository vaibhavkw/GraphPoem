Title : Sonnet 53: What is your substance, whereof are you made <br>
Author : William Shakespeare <br><br>

What is your substance, whereof are you <mark4>made,</mark4><br>
That millions of strange shadows on you <mark4>tend?</mark4><br>
Since every one hath, every one, one <mark4>shade,</mark4><br>
And you, but one, can every shadow <mark4>lend.</mark4><br>
Describe Adonis, and the <mark4>counterfeit</mark4><br>
Is poorly imitated after <mark3>you;</mark3><br>
On Helen's cheek all art of beauty <mark4>set,</mark4><br>
And you in Grecian tires are painted <mark3>new.</mark3><br>
Speak of the spring and foison of the <mark3>year:</mark3><br>
The one doth shadow of your beauty <mark3>show,</mark3><br>
The other as your bounty doth <mark3>appear;</mark3><br>
And you in every blessed shape we <mark3>know.</mark3><br>
In all external grace you have some <mark4>part,</mark4><br>
But you like none, none you, for constant <mark3>heart.</mark3><br>
