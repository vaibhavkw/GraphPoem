Title : from The Bridge: The Tunnel <br>
Author : Hart Crane <br><br>

Performances, assortments, <mark4>resumes--</mark4><br>
Up Times Square to Columbus Circle <mark5>lights</mark5><br>
Channel the <mark4>congresses</mark4>, nightly <mark4>sessions,</mark4><br>
Refractions of the thousand <mark4>theatres</mark4>, <mark4>faces--</mark4><br>
Mysterious kitchens. . . . You shall search them <mark4>all.</mark4><br>
Someday by heart you'll learn each famous <mark3>sight</mark3><br>
And watch the curtain lift in hell's <mark3>despite;</mark3><br>
You'll find the garden in the third act <mark3>dead,</mark3><br>
Finger your knees--and wish yourself in <mark3>bed</mark3><br>
With tabloid crime-sheets perched in easy <mark1>sight.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then let you reach your <mark4>hat</mark4><br>
and <mark3>go.</mark3><br>
As usual, let <mark5>you--also</mark5><br>
walking <mark5>down--exclaim</mark5><br>
to twelve upward <mark4>leaving</mark4><br>
a subscription <mark4>praise</mark4><br>
            for what time slays. <br>
<br>
Or can't you quite make up your mind to <mark4>ride;</mark4><br>
A walk is better underneath the L a <mark5>brisk</mark5><br>
Ten blocks or so before? But you find <mark5>yourself</mark5><br>
Preparing penguin flexions of the <mark4>arms,--</mark4><br>
As usual you will meet the scuttle <mark4>yawn:</mark4><br>
The subway yawns the quickest promise <mark4>home.</mark4><br>
<br>
Be minimum, then, to swim the hiving <mark4>swarms</mark4><br>
Out of the Square, the Circle burning <mark4>bright--</mark4><br>
Avoid the glass doors gyring at your <mark3>right,</mark3><br>
Where boxed alone a second, eyes take <mark3>fright</mark3><br>
--Quite unprepared rush naked back to <mark3>light:</mark3><br>
And down beside the turnstile press the <mark4>coin</mark4><br>
Into the slot. The gongs already <mark4>rattle.</mark4><br>
<br>
And <mark3>so</mark3><br>
of cities you <mark4>bespeak</mark4><br>
subways, rivered under <mark4>streets</mark4><br>
and rivers. . . . In the <mark4>car</mark4><br>
the overtone of <mark4>motion</mark4><br>
underground, the <mark4>monotone</mark4><br>
of motion is the <mark4>sound</mark4><br>
of other faces, also <mark4>underground--</mark4><br>
<br>
"Let's have a pencil Jimmy--living now <br>
at Floral <mark4>Park</mark4><br>
Flatbush--on the fourth of <mark3>July--</mark3><br>
like a pigeon's muddy dream--potatoes <br>
to dig in the field--travlin the town--too-- <br>
night after night--the Culver <mark5>line--the</mark5><br>
girls all shaping up--it used to <mark4>be--"</mark4><br>
<br>
Our tongues recant like beaten weather <mark4>vanes.</mark4><br>
This answer lives like verdigris, like <mark4>hair</mark4><br>
Beyond <mark4>extinction</mark4>, surcease of the <mark4>bone;</mark4><br>
And repetition freezes--"What <br>
<br>
"what do you want? getting weak on the <mark4>links?</mark4><br>
fandaddle daddy don't ask for change--IS <mark4>THIS</mark4><br>
FOURTEENTH it's half past six she <mark5>said--if</mark5><br>
you don't like my gate why did <mark5>you</mark5><br>
swing on it, why didja <br>
swing on <mark4>it</mark4><br>
<br>
And somehow anyhow <mark4>swing--</mark4><br>
The phonographs of hades in the <mark4>brain</mark4><br>
<br>
Are tunnels that re-wind themselves, and <mark4>love</mark4><br>
A burnt match skating in a urinal--          <br>
Somewhere above Fourteenth TAKE THE <mark4>EXPRESS</mark4><br>
To brush some new presentiment of <mark3>pain--</mark3><br>
"But I want service in this office <mark4>SERVICE</mark4><br>
<br>
I <mark5>said--after</mark5><br>
the show she cried a little afterwards <mark4>but--"</mark4><br>
Whose head is swinging from the swollen <mark5>strap?</mark5><br>
<br>
Whose body smokes along the bitten <mark4>rails,</mark4><br>
Bursts from a smoldering bundle far <mark4>behind</mark4><br>
In back forks of the chasms of the <mark1>brain,--</mark1><br>
Puffs from a riven stump far out <mark1>behind</mark1><br>
In interborough fissures of the mind . . . <mark3>?</mark3><br>
And why do I often meet your visage <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
<br>
Your eyes like agate lanterns--on and <mark4>on</mark4><br>
Below the toothpaste and the dandruff <mark4>ads?</mark4><br>
--And did their riding eyes right through your <mark4>side,</mark4><br>
And did their eyes like unwashed platters <mark1>ride?</mark1><br>
And Death, aloft,--gigantically <mark4>down</mark4><br>
Probing through you--toward me, O <mark4>evermore!</mark4><br>
And when they dragged your retching flesh, <br>
Your trembling hands that night through <mark3>Baltimore--</mark3><br>
That last night on the ballot rounds, did <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
Shaking, did you deny the ticket, <mark3>Poe?</mark3><br>
For Gravesend Manor change at Chambers <mark4>Street.</mark4><br>
<br>
The platform hurries along to a dead <mark4>stop.</mark4><br>
The intent escalator lifts a <mark4>serenade</mark4><br>
<br>
Of shoes, umbrellas, each eye attending its shoe, <mark4>then</mark4><br>
<br>
Bolting outright somewhere above where <mark1>streets</mark1><br>
Burst suddenly in rain. . . . The gongs recur: <br>
Elbows and levers, guard and hissing <mark4>door.</mark4><br>
Thunder is galvothermic here below. . . . The <mark1>car</mark1><br>
Wheels off. The train rounds, bending to a <mark4>scream,</mark4><br>
Taking the final level for the <mark4>dive</mark4><br>
Under the <mark1>river--</mark1><br>
And somewhat emptier than <mark4>before,</mark4><br>
Demented, for a hitching second, humps; <mark1>then</mark1><br>
Lets go. . . . Toward corners of the <mark3>floor</mark3><br>
Newspapers <mark1>wing</mark1>, revolve and <mark3>wing.</mark3><br>
Blank windows gargle signals through the <mark3>roar.</mark3><br>
And does the Daemon take you home, also, <br>
<br>
Wop washerwoman, with the bandaged <mark1>hair?</mark1><br>
After the corridors are swept, the cuspidors-- <br>
The gaunt sky-barracks cleanly now, and <mark3>bare,</mark3><br>
O Genoese, do you bring mother eyes and <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
Back home to children and to golden <mark1>hair?</mark1><br>
<mark4>Daemon</mark4>, demurring and eventful <mark1>yawn!</mark1><br>
<br>
Whose hideous laughter is a bellows <mark3>mirth</mark3><br>
--Or the muffled slaughter of a day in <mark3>birth--</mark3><br>
O cruelly to inoculate the brinking <mark3>dawn</mark3><br>
With antennae toward worlds that glow and <mark4>sink;--</mark4><br>
To spoon us out more liquid than the <mark4>dim</mark4><br>
Locution of the eldest star, and <mark4>pack</mark4><br>
The conscience navelled in the plunging <mark4>wind,</mark4><br>
Umbilical to call--and straightway <mark3>die!</mark3><br>
O caught like pennies beneath soot and <mark4>steam,</mark4><br>
<br>
Kiss of our agony thou <mark1>gatherest;</mark1><br>
Condensed, thou takest all--shrill ganglia <br>
Impassioned with some song we fail to <mark4>keep.</mark4><br>
And yet, like Lazarus, to feel the <mark4>slope,</mark4><br>
The sod and billow breaking,--lifting <mark4>ground,</mark4><br>
--A sound of waters bending astride the <mark3>sky</mark3><br>
Unceasing with some Word that will not die . . . <mark1>!</mark1><br>
.         .         .         .         .<br>
<br>
A tugboat, wheezing wreaths of <mark1>steam,</mark1><br>
<br>
Lunged past, with one galvanic blare stove up the <mark1>River.</mark1><br>
I counted the echoes assembling, one after <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
Searching, thumbing the midnight on the <mark4>piers.</mark4><br>
Lights, coasting, left the oily tympanum of <mark4>waters;</mark4><br>
The blackness somewhere gouged glass on a <mark1>sky.</mark1><br>
And this thy harbor, O my City, I have driven <mark4>under,</mark4><br>
Tossed from the coil of ticking towers. . . . Tomorrow, <br>
And to be. . . . Hereby the River that is <mark4>East--</mark4><br>
Here at the waters' edge the hands drop <mark4>memory;</mark4><br>
Shadowless in that abyss they unaccounting <mark3>lie.</mark3><br>
How far away the star has pooled the <mark3>sea--</mark3><br>
Or shall the hands be drawn away, to <mark1>die?</mark1><br>
Kiss of our agony Thou <mark1>gatherest,</mark1><br>
<br>
O Hand of <mark4>Fire</mark4><br>
