Title : Consequences <br>
Author : William Meredith <br><br>

I. Of <mark4>Choice</mark4><br>
Despair is big with friends I <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
Hydrogen and burning <mark3>jews.</mark3><br>
I give them all the grief I <mark4>have</mark4><br>
But I tell them, friends, I <mark1>choose</mark1>, I <mark3>choose,</mark3><br>
<br>
Don't make me say against my <mark4>glands</mark4><br>
Or how the world has treated <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
Though gay and modest give <mark4>offense</mark4><br>
And people grieve pretentiously,<br>
<br>
More than I hoped to <mark1>do</mark1>, I <mark1>do</mark1><br>
And more than I deserve I <mark4>get;</mark4><br>
What little I attend, I know<br>
And it argues order more than <mark4>not.</mark4><br>
<br>
My desperate friends, I want to <mark3>tell</mark3><br>
Them, you take too delicate <mark1>offense</mark1><br>
At the stench of time and man's own <mark3>smell,</mark3><br>
It is only the smell of <mark4>consequence.</mark4><br>
<br>
II. Of <mark1>Love</mark1><br>
People love each other and the <mark4>light</mark4><br>
Of love gilds but doesn't <mark3>alter,</mark3><br>
People don't change one another, can <mark4>scarcely</mark4><br>
By taking will and thought add a <mark4>little</mark4><br>
Now and then to their own <mark5>statures</mark5><br>
Which, praise them, they <mark1>do,</mark1><br>
So that here we are in all our <mark4>sizes</mark4><br>
Flooded in the impartial daylight <mark4>sometimes,</mark4><br>
Spotted sometimes in a light we make <mark4>ourselves,</mark4><br>
<mark4>Human</mark4>, the beams of <mark4>attention</mark4><br>
Of social animals at their <mark4>work</mark4><br>
Which is loving; and sometimes all <mark4>dark.</mark4><br>
<br>
The only correction <mark4>is</mark4><br>
By you of you, by me of <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
People are worth looking at in this <mark1>light</mark1><br>
And if you listen what they are saying <mark1>is,</mark1><br>
Love me sun out there whoever you <mark3>are,</mark3><br>
Chasing me from bed in the morning, <br>
Spooking me all day with shadow, <br>
Surprising me whenever you <mark4>fall;</mark4><br>
Make me conspicuous as I go <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
Spotted by however many <mark4>beams,</mark4><br>
Now light, finally dark. I <mark4>fear</mark4><br>
There is meant to be a lot of <mark4>darkness,</mark4><br>
You hear them say, but every last <mark3>creature</mark3><br>
Is the one it meant to <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
<br>
III. My <mark4>Acts</mark4><br>
The acts of my life swarm down the street like Puerto Rican <mark4>kids,</mark4><br>
Foreign but small and, except for one, unknived. <br>
They do no harm though their voices slash like <mark4>reeds;</mark4><br>
All except one they have evidently been <mark5>loved.</mark5><br>
<br>
And down the hill where I've planted spruce and red <mark4>pine</mark4><br>
In a gang of spiked shadows they slouch at <mark3>night.</mark3><br>
I am reasonably brave. I have <mark4>been</mark4>, except on one <mark4>occasion,</mark4><br>
Myself: it is no good trying to be what you are <mark1>not.</mark1><br>
<br>
We live among gangs who seem to have no <mark4>stake</mark4><br>
In what we're trying to do, no sense of property or <mark4>race,</mark4><br>
Yet if you speak with authority they will halt and <mark3>break</mark3><br>
And sullenly, one by one, show you a local <mark3>face.</mark3><br>
<br>
I dreamt once that they caught me and, holding me <mark4>down,</mark4><br>
Burned my genitals with <mark4>gasoline;</mark4><br>
In my stupid terror I was telling them <mark4>names</mark4><br>
So my manhood kept and the rest went up in <mark3>flames.</mark3><br>
<br>
'Now, say the world is a fair place,' the biggest one <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
And because there was no face worse than my own <mark4>there</mark4><br>
I said it and got up. Quite a lot of me is <mark4>charred.</mark4><br>
By our code it is <mark1>fair</mark1>, We play fair. The world is <mark3>fair.</mark3><br>
