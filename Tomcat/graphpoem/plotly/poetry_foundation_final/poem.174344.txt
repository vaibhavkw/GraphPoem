Title : I Have a Rendezvous with Death <br>
Author : Alan Seeger <br><br>

<br>
I have a rendezvous with <mark1>Death</mark1><br>
At some disputed <mark4>barricade,</mark4><br>
When Spring comes back with rustling <mark4>shade</mark4><br>
And apple-blossoms fill the <mark3>air--</mark3><br>
I have a rendezvous with <mark1>Death</mark1><br>
When Spring brings back blue days and <mark3>fair.</mark3><br>
<br>
It may be he shall take my <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
And lead me into his dark <mark3>land</mark3><br>
And close my eyes and quench my <mark3>breath--</mark3><br>
It may be I shall pass him <mark3>still.</mark3><br>
I have a rendezvous with <mark1>Death</mark1><br>
On some scarred slope of battered <mark3>hill,</mark3><br>
When Spring comes round again this <mark4>year</mark4><br>
And the first meadow-flowers <mark3>appear.</mark3><br>
<br>
God knows 'twere better to be <mark3>deep</mark3><br>
Pillowed in silk and scented <mark3>down,</mark3><br>
Where Love throbs out in blissful <mark3>sleep,</mark3><br>
Pulse nigh to pulse, and breath to <mark1>breath,</mark1><br>
Where hushed awakenings are dear <mark3>...</mark3><br>
But I've a rendezvous with <mark1>Death</mark1><br>
At midnight in some flaming <mark3>town,</mark3><br>
When Spring trips north again this <mark1>year,</mark1><br>
And I to my pledged word am true,<br>
I shall not fail that rendezvous.<br>
