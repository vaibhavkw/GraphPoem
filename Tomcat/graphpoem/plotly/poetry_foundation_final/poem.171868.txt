Title : For the Anniversary of My Death <br>
Author : W. S. Merwin <br><br>

Every year without knowing it I have passed the day   <br>
When the last fires will wave to me <br>
And the silence will set <mark4>out</mark4><br>
Tireless <mark4>traveler</mark4><br>
Like the beam of a lightless star <br>
<br>
Then I will no <mark4>longer</mark4><br>
Find myself in life as in a strange <mark4>garment</mark4><br>
Surprised at the earth <br>
And the love of one <mark4>woman</mark4><br>
And the shamelessness of <mark4>men</mark4><br>
As today writing after three days of <mark4>rain</mark4><br>
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease <br>
And bowing not knowing to <mark4>what</mark4><br>
