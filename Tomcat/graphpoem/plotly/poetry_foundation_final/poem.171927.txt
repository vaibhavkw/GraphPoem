Title : On Scratchbury Camp <br>
Author : Siegfried Sassoon <br><br>

Along the grave green downs, this idle <mark3>afternoon,</mark3><br>
Shadows of loitering silver clouds, becalmed in <mark3>blue,</mark3><br>
Bring, like unfoldment of a flower, the best of <mark3>June.</mark3><br>
<br>
Shadows outspread in spacious movement, always <mark3>you</mark3><br>
Have dappled the downs and valleys at this time of <mark4>year,</mark4><br>
While larks, ascending shrill, praised freedom as they <mark3>flew.</mark3><br>
Now, through that song, a fighter-squadron's drone I <mark4>hear</mark4><br>
From Scratchbury Camp, whose turfed and cowslip'd rampart <mark3>seems</mark3><br>
More hill than history, ageless and <mark3>oblivion-blurred.</mark3><br>
<br>
I walk the fosse, once manned by bronze and flint-head <mark4>spear;</mark4><br>
On war's imperious wing the shafted sun-ray <mark3>gleams:</mark3><br>
One with the warm sweet air of summer stoops the <mark3>bird.</mark3><br>
<br>
Cloud <mark4>shadows</mark4>, drifting slow like heedless daylight <mark3>dreams,</mark3><br>
Dwell and dissolve; uncircumstanced they pause and <mark3>pass.</mark3><br>
I watch them go. My horse, contented, crops the <mark3>grass.</mark3><br>
