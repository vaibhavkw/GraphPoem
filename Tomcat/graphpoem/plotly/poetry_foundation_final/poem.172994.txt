Title : Sonnets from the Portuguese 22: When our two souls stand up erect and strong <br>
Author : Elizabeth Barrett Browning <br><br>

When our two souls stand up erect and <mark3>strong,</mark3><br>
Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher, <br>
Until the lengthening wings break into <mark3>fire</mark3><br>
At either curved point, -- what bitter <mark3>wrong</mark3><br>
Can the earth do to us, that we should not <mark3>long</mark3><br>
Be here contented ? Think. In mounting <mark3>higher,</mark3><br>
The angels would press on us, and <mark3>aspire</mark3><br>
To drop some golden orb of perfect <mark3>song</mark3><br>
Into our deep, dear silence. Let us <mark3>stay</mark3><br>
Rather on earth, Beloved, -- where the <mark3>unfit</mark3><br>
Contrarious moods of men recoil <mark3>away</mark3><br>
And isolate pure spirits, and <mark3>permit</mark3><br>
A place to stand and love in for a <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
With darkness and the death-hour rounding <mark3>it.</mark3><br>
