Title : She Was a Phantom of Delight <br>
Author : William Wordsworth <br><br>

She was a Phantom of <mark3>delight</mark3><br>
When first she gleamed upon my <mark3>sight;</mark3><br>
A lovely Apparition, <mark4>sent</mark4><br>
To be a moment's <mark4>ornament;</mark4><br>
Her eyes as stars of Twilight <mark3>fair;</mark3><br>
Like Twilight's, too, her dusky <mark3>hair;</mark3><br>
But all things else about her <mark3>drawn</mark3><br>
From May-time and the cheerful <mark3>Dawn;</mark3><br>
A dancing Shape, an Image gay,<br>
To haunt, to startle, and way-lay.<br>
I saw her upon nearer <mark3>view,</mark3><br>
A Spirit, yet a Woman <mark3>too!</mark3><br>
Her household motions light and free,<br>
And steps of virgin-liberty;<br>
A countenance in which did <mark4>meet</mark4><br>
Sweet records, promises as <mark3>sweet;</mark3><br>
A Creature not too bright or <mark4>good</mark4><br>
For human nature's daily <mark4>food;</mark4><br>
For transient <mark4>sorrows</mark4>, simple <mark4>wiles,</mark4><br>
Praise, blame, love, kisses, <mark4>tears</mark4>, and <mark3>smiles.</mark3><br>
And now I see with eye <mark4>serene</mark4><br>
The very pulse of the <mark3>machine;</mark3><br>
A Being breathing thoughtful <mark3>breath,</mark3><br>
A Traveller between life and <mark3>death;</mark3><br>
The reason firm, the temperate <mark5>will,</mark5><br>
Endurance, foresight, strength, and <mark3>skill;</mark3><br>
A perfect Woman, nobly <mark4>planned,</mark4><br>
To warn, to comfort, and <mark3>command;</mark3><br>
And yet a Spirit still, and <mark4>bright</mark4><br>
With something of angelic <mark3>light.</mark3><br>
