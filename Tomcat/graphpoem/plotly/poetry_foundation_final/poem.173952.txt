Title : The Mower's Song <br>
Author : Andrew Marvell <br><br>

My mind was once the true <mark3>survey</mark3><br>
Of all these meadows fresh and <mark3>gay,</mark3><br>
And in the greenness of the <mark3>grass</mark3><br>
Did see its hopes as in a <mark3>glass;</mark3><br>
When Juliana came, and <mark3>she</mark3><br>
What I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
<br>
But these, while I with sorrow <mark3>pine,</mark3><br>
Grew more luxuriant still and <mark3>fine,</mark3><br>
      That not one blade of grass you spy'd <br>
      But had a flower on either side; <br>
When Juliana came, and <mark1>she</mark1><br>
What I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
<br>
Unthankful meadows, could you <mark3>so</mark3><br>
A fellowship so true <mark3>forgo?</mark3><br>
And in your gaudy May-games <mark3>meet</mark3><br>
While I lay trodden under <mark3>feet?</mark3><br>
When Juliana came, and <mark1>she</mark1><br>
What I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
<br>
But what you in compassion <mark4>ought,</mark4><br>
Shall now by my revenge be <mark3>wrought;</mark3><br>
And flow'rs, and grass, and I and <mark3>all,</mark3><br>
Will in one common ruin <mark3>fall.</mark3><br>
For Juliana comes, and <mark1>she</mark1><br>
What I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
<br>
And thus, ye meadows, which have <mark4>been</mark4><br>
Companions of my thoughts more <mark4>green,</mark4><br>
Shall now the heraldry <mark4>become</mark4><br>
With which I shall adorn my <mark4>tomb;</mark4><br>
For Juliana comes, and <mark1>she</mark1><br>
What I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
