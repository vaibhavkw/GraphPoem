Title : The Song of the Ungirt Runners <br>
Author : Charles Hamilton Sorley <br><br>

<br>
We swing ungirded <mark3>hips,</mark3><br>
And lightened are our <mark3>eyes,</mark3><br>
The rain is on our <mark3>lips,</mark3><br>
We do not run for <mark3>prize.</mark3><br>
We know not whom we <mark3>trust</mark3><br>
Nor whitherward we <mark3>fare,</mark3><br>
But we run because we <mark3>must</mark3><br>
Through the great wide <mark3>air.</mark3><br>
<br>
The waters of the <mark4>seas</mark4><br>
Are troubled as by <mark3>storm.</mark3><br>
The tempest strips the <mark3>trees</mark3><br>
And does not leave them <mark3>warm.</mark3><br>
Does the tearing tempest <mark4>pause?</mark4><br>
Do the tree-tops ask it <mark3>why?</mark3><br>
So we run without a <mark3>cause</mark3><br>
'Neath the big bare <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
<br>
The rain is on our <mark1>lips,</mark1><br>
We do not run for <mark1>prize.</mark1><br>
But the storm the water <mark3>whips</mark3><br>
And the wave howls to the <mark3>skies.</mark3><br>
The winds arise and strike <mark4>it</mark4><br>
And scatter it like <mark3>sand,</mark3><br>
And we run because we like <mark1>it</mark1><br>
Through the broad bright <mark3>land.</mark3><br>
