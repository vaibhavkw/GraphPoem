Title : The Circuit Judge <br>
Author : Edgar Lee Masters <br><br>

Take note, passers-by, of the sharp erosions <br>
Eaten in my head-stone by the wind and rain i <br>
Almost as if an intangible Nemesis or <mark4>hatred</mark4><br>
Were marking scores against <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
But to destroy, and not preserve, my memory. <br>
I in life was the Circuit Judge, a maker of notches, <br>
Deciding cases on the points the lawyers <mark4>scored,</mark4><br>
Not on the right of the <mark4>matter.</mark4><br>
O wind and <mark4>rain</mark4>, leave my head-stone <mark4>alone!</mark4><br>
For worse than the anger of the <mark4>wronged,</mark4><br>
The curses of the <mark4>poor,</mark4><br>
Was to lie speechless, yet with vision <mark4>clear,</mark4><br>
Seeing that even Hod Putt, the <mark4>murderer,</mark4><br>
Hanged by my sentence, <br>
Was innocent in soul compared with <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
