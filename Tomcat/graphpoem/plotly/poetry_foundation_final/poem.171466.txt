Title : The Harp <br>
Author : Bruce Weigl <br><br>

When he was my age and I was already a boy   <br>
my father made a machine in the garage.   <br>
A wired piece of <mark4>steel</mark4><br>
with many small and beautiful <mark4>welds</mark4><br>
ground so smooth they resembled rows of <mark4>pearls.</mark4><br>
<br>
He went broke with whatever it <mark4>was.</mark4><br>
He held it so carefully in his <mark4>arms.</mark4><br>
He carried it foundry to foundry.   <br>
I think it was his harp, <br>
I think it was what he longed to <mark4>make</mark4><br>
with his hands for the <mark5>world.</mark5><br>
<br>
He moved it finally from the locked closet   <br>
to the bedroom <br>
to the garage <mark4>again</mark4><br>
where he hung it on the <mark4>wall</mark4><br>
until I climbed and pulled it <mark4>down</mark4><br>
and rubbed it <mark4>clean</mark4><br>
and tried to make it <mark4>work.</mark4><br>
