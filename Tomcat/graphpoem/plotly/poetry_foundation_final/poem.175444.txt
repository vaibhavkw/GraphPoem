You couples lying <br>
where moon-scythes and day-scythes reaped you, <br>
browning fruit falls and <mark4>sleeps</mark4><br>
in tangled <mark4>nests</mark4>, the wild <mark4>grass,</mark4><br>
falls from your apple tree that still grows <mark4>here:</mark4><br>
cry for your dead hero, his weak sword, his <mark3>flight,</mark3><br>
that you were slaughtered and your bed poured <mark4>whiteness,</mark4><br>
the issue of murdered marriage <mark4>dawns.</mark4><br>
The streets crack, a house falls open to the <mark4>air,</mark4><br>
sun and rain lie on the <mark4>bed.</mark4><br>
And the river still runs in a child's <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
under the factory's black <mark4>hulk,</mark4><br>
four stacks that used to bloom with <mark4>smoke</mark4><br>
over shining leaves, beneath thunderheads. <br>
Then the <mark4>storm</mark4><br>
shatters and beats and <mark4>after</mark4><br>
in <mark4>woods</mark4><br>
a scented smoke of <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
a dripping quiet, and the small gold <mark4>snake</mark4><br>
sparkles at the pond's <mark4>edge.</mark4><br>
But who is he? What were <br>
the goods he made, what became of his loved wife, <br>
his children, and <mark3>where</mark3><br>
has he gone, fearsome, powerless? The <mark4>silver</mark4><br>
path of air from the river's bend to its rippling away <br>
beneath the low concrete <mark4>bridge</mark4><br>
is still pure. No one comes, and the <mark4>child</mark4><br>
who watched by it has <mark4>vanished.</mark4><br>
Or sometimes he appears for a day, a <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
in the walls and windows reflected on the <mark4>water,</mark4><br>
in goldfinches' flight, cricket song, the heron's <mark4>great</mark4><br>
rise from the bank. Last a carp <mark4>leaps,</mark4><br>
voices and a lantern slide down the secret <mark4>stream</mark4><br>
in black and gold <mark4>peace,</mark4><br>
past the child's husk, the family never born.<br>
