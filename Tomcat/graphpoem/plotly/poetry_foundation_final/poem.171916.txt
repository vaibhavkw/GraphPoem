Title : Fermanagh Cave <br>
Author : Sherod Santos <br><br>

An emerald dungeon's blacklight glow   <br>
glimmered in the deeper <mark4>reaches</mark4><br>
where my son and I could hear the slub   <br>
of water riddling through the <mark4>muck.</mark4><br>
<br>
We'd stumbled on it following a <mark4>stream,</mark4><br>
his first cave made stranger <mark4>still</mark4><br>
by a chill that closes on the goblined <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
of a boy inflamed by stories <mark3>where</mark3><br>
<br>
gnome-clans hoarded <mark4>underground</mark4><br>
bone-shard, mandrake, monkey <mark4>gland,</mark4><br>
and eel. And so, grave <mark4>Hansel</mark4><br>
paying out his last scraps of <mark4>bread,</mark4><br>
<br>
he inched inward looking <mark4>back</mark4><br>
and gathering himself as he <mark4>devolved</mark4><br>
step by step along the wet-ribbed <mark4>walls,</mark4><br>
the omphalos seepage of a subterranea <br>
<br>
that dreamed us into its kingdom <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
where like some secret <mark4>dreams</mark4><br>
make known the burnt-punk <mark4>smell</mark4><br>
of marijuana cluttered up the <mark3>air,</mark3><br>
<br>
and just beyond, just close enough to <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
a spur of light that like a <mark4>dwindling</mark4><br>
eyemote <mark4>disappeared</mark4>, Then the <mark4>sound</mark4><br>
a human soul makes as it slips <mark4>out</mark4><br>
<br>
from the throat. Composed in <mark4>darkness,</mark4><br>
my son's hand closed on mine. I <mark4>bent</mark4><br>
to whisper we could turn back now, <br>
but his voice was there before me <mark4>saying,</mark4><br>
<br>
"Something's here." And something <mark4>was,</mark4><br>
something that in that instant <mark4>rose,</mark4><br>
and moved off from <mark4>us</mark4>, or drew up <mark3>close.</mark3><br>
In either case, my son came to <mark3>me</mark3><br>
<br>
almost weightlessly at first, then hungry   <br>
for what was filling up my <mark4>arms,</mark4><br>
the startled, upriding bodyweight   <br>
of a boy I'd never before felt <mark4>rock</mark4><br>
<br>
so solidly into the place I <mark1>was,</mark1><br>
blind and hunkered in the earthen <mark1>air.</mark1><br>
I held him only a moment <mark3>there.</mark3><br>
We didn't speak. And though the <mark4>wheeze</mark4><br>
<br>
of his breathing must've stopped my <mark4>ears,</mark4><br>
for weeks to come, settling him <mark1>back</mark1><br>
to sleep at night, or waking <mark4>him</mark4><br>
from some troubling dream, I'd <mark4>hear</mark4><br>
<br>
the soft concussion of an outsized <mark1>heart-</mark1><br>
beat I could not decide was <mark4>mine,</mark4><br>
or his, or the stranger's I had brought us to.   <br>
Or if what happened would happen <mark4>again,</mark4><br>
<br>
years from now, when he is <mark4>grown,</mark4><br>
and I have grown newly strange to <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
