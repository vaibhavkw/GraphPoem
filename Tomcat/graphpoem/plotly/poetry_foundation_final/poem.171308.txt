Title : Through a Glass Eye, Lightly <br>
Author : Carolyn Kizer <br><br>

In the laboratory waiting <mark4>room</mark4><br>
<br>
one television actor with a teary <mark4>face</mark4><br>
trying a contact <mark4>lens;</mark4><br>
two muscular victims of industrial <mark4>accidents;</mark4><br>
several vain women--I was one of <mark4>them--</mark4><br>
came Deborah, four, to pick up her glass <mark3>eye.</mark3><br>
<br>
It was a long <mark3>day:</mark3><br>
Deborah waiting for the blood <mark4>vessels</mark4><br>
<br>
on her iris to <mark3>dry.</mark3><br>
Her mother said that, holding Deborah <br>
when she was <mark4>born,</mark4><br>
"First I inspected her, from toes to <mark4>navel,</mark4><br>
then stopped at her head <mark4>..."</mark4><br>
We wondered <mark3>why</mark3><br>
the inspection hadn't gone the other <mark3>way.</mark3><br>
"Looking into her <mark1>eye</mark1><br>
was like looking into a volcano: <br>
<br>
"Her vacant <mark4>pupil</mark4><br>
went whirling <mark4>down</mark4>, down to the <mark4>foundation</mark4><br>
of the world <mark4>...</mark4><br>
When she was three months old they took it out.   <br>
She giggled when she went under <br>
the <mark4>anaesthetic.</mark4><br>
Forty-five minutes later she came <mark4>back</mark4><br>
happy! <mark4>...</mark4><br>
The gas wore off, she found the hole in her <mark1>face</mark1><br>
(you know, it never <mark4>bled?),</mark4><br>
stayed happy, even when I went to <mark4>pieces.</mark4><br>
She's five, in <mark4>June.</mark4><br>
<br>
"Deborah, you get right <mark4>down</mark4><br>
from there, or I'll have to <mark3>slap!"</mark3><br>
Laughing, Deborah climbed into the <mark3>lap</mark3><br>
of one vain lady, who <br>
had been discontented with her own <mark4>beauty.</mark4><br>
Now she held on to Deborah, looked her <mark4>steadily</mark4><br>
in the empty <mark1>eye.</mark1><br>
