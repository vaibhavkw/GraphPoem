Title : Goblin Market <br>
Author : Christina Rossetti <br><br>

Morning and <mark1>evening</mark1><br>
Maids heard the goblins <mark3>cry:</mark3><br>
"Come buy our orchard <mark4>fruits,</mark4><br>
Come <mark1>buy</mark1>, come <mark3>buy:</mark3><br>
Apples and quinces,<br>
Lemons and <mark4>oranges,</mark4><br>
Plump unpeck'd <mark4>cherries,</mark4><br>
Melons and <mark4>raspberries,</mark4><br>
Bloom-down-cheek'd <mark4>peaches,</mark4><br>
Swart-headed mulberries,<br>
Wild free-born <mark4>cranberries,</mark4><br>
Crab-apples, <mark5>dewberries,</mark5><br>
<mark4>Pine-apples</mark4>, <mark3>blackberries,</mark3><br>
Apricots, <mark3>strawberries;--</mark3><br>
All ripe <mark3>together</mark3><br>
In summer <mark3>weather,--</mark3><br>
Morns that pass <mark2>by,</mark2><br>
Fair eves that <mark3>fly;</mark3><br>
Come <mark1>buy</mark1>, come <mark1>buy:</mark1><br>
Our grapes fresh from the <mark3>vine,</mark3><br>
Pomegranates full and <mark3>fine,</mark3><br>
Dates and sharp bullaces,<br>
Rare pears and <mark5>greengages,</mark5><br>
Damsons and bilberries,<br>
Taste them and <mark3>try:</mark3><br>
Currants and <mark3>gooseberries,</mark3><br>
Bright-fire-like barberries,<br>
Figs to fill your <mark3>mouth,</mark3><br>
Citrons from the <mark3>South,</mark3><br>
Sweet to tongue and sound to <mark3>eye;</mark3><br>
Come <mark1>buy</mark1>, come <mark1>buy."</mark1><br>
<br>
Evening by <mark1>evening</mark1><br>
Among the brookside <mark4>rushes,</mark4><br>
Laura bow'd her head to <mark5>hear,</mark5><br>
Lizzie veil'd her <mark3>blushes:</mark3><br>
Crouching close <mark1>together</mark1><br>
In the cooling <mark1>weather,</mark1><br>
With clasping arms and cautioning <mark4>lips,</mark4><br>
With tingling cheeks and finger <mark3>tips.</mark3><br>
"Lie close," Laura <mark3>said,</mark3><br>
Pricking up her golden <mark3>head:</mark3><br>
"We must not look at goblin <mark4>men,</mark4><br>
We must not buy their <mark1>fruits:</mark1><br>
Who knows upon what soil they <mark3>fed</mark3><br>
Their hungry thirsty <mark3>roots?"</mark3><br>
"Come buy," call the <mark4>goblins</mark4><br>
Hobbling down the <mark3>glen.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Oh," cried Lizzie, <mark2>"Laura</mark2>, <mark2>Laura,</mark2><br>
You should not peep at goblin <mark1>men."</mark1><br>
Lizzie cover'd up her <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
Cover'd close lest they should <mark3>look;</mark3><br>
Laura rear'd her glossy <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
And whisper'd like the restless <mark3>brook:</mark3><br>
"Look, Lizzie, look, <mark4>Lizzie,</mark4><br>
Down the glen tramp little <mark1>men.</mark1><br>
One hauls a <mark4>basket,</mark4><br>
One bears a <mark4>plate,</mark4><br>
One lugs a golden <mark5>dish</mark5><br>
Of many pounds <mark3>weight.</mark3><br>
How fair the vine must <mark3>grow</mark3><br>
Whose grapes are so <mark4>luscious;</mark4><br>
How warm the wind must <mark3>blow</mark3><br>
Through those fruit <mark4>bushes."</mark4><br>
"No," said Lizzie, "No, <mark1>no</mark1>, <mark3>no;</mark3><br>
Their offers should not charm <mark4>us,</mark4><br>
Their evil gifts would harm <mark1>us."</mark1><br>
She thrust a dimpled <mark4>finger</mark4><br>
In each ear, shut eyes and <mark4>ran:</mark4><br>
Curious Laura chose to <mark3>linger</mark3><br>
Wondering at each merchant <mark3>man.</mark3><br>
One had a cat's <mark4>face,</mark4><br>
One whisk'd a <mark3>tail,</mark3><br>
One tramp'd at a rat's <mark3>pace,</mark3><br>
One crawl'd like a <mark3>snail,</mark3><br>
One like a wombat prowl'd obtuse and <mark4>furry,</mark4><br>
One like a ratel tumbled hurry <mark1>skurry.</mark1><br>
She heard a voice like voice of <mark4>doves</mark4><br>
Cooing all <mark1>together:</mark1><br>
They sounded kind and full of <mark3>loves</mark3><br>
In the pleasant <mark1>weather.</mark1><br>
<br>
Laura stretch'd her gleaming <mark4>neck</mark4><br>
Like a rush-imbedded <mark4>swan,</mark4><br>
Like a lily from the <mark3>beck,</mark3><br>
Like a moonlit poplar <mark4>branch,</mark4><br>
Like a vessel at the <mark4>launch</mark4><br>
When its last restraint is <mark3>gone.</mark3><br>
<br>
Backwards up the mossy <mark1>glen</mark1><br>
Turn'd and troop'd the goblin <mark1>men,</mark1><br>
With their shrill repeated <mark1>cry,</mark1><br>
"Come <mark1>buy</mark1>, come <mark1>buy."</mark1><br>
When they reach'd where Laura <mark4>was</mark4><br>
They stood stock still upon the <mark4>moss,</mark4><br>
Leering at each <mark4>other,</mark4><br>
Brother with queer <mark3>brother;</mark3><br>
Signalling each <mark1>other,</mark1><br>
Brother with sly <mark1>brother.</mark1><br>
One set his basket <mark4>down,</mark4><br>
One rear'd his <mark1>plate;</mark1><br>
One began to weave a <mark3>crown</mark3><br>
Of tendrils, leaves, and rough nuts <mark3>brown</mark3><br>
(Men sell not such in any <mark3>town);</mark3><br>
One heav'd the golden <mark1>weight</mark1><br>
Of dish and fruit to offer <mark3>her:</mark3><br>
"Come buy, come <mark3>buy,</mark3>, was still their <mark1>cry.</mark1><br>
Laura stared but did not <mark3>stir,</mark3><br>
Long'd but had no <mark4>money:</mark4><br>
The whisk-tail'd merchant bade her <mark4>taste</mark4><br>
In tones as smooth as <mark3>honey,</mark3><br>
The cat-faced <mark4>purr'd,</mark4><br>
The rat-faced spoke a <mark4>word</mark4><br>
Of welcome, and the snail-paced even was <mark3>heard;</mark3><br>
One parrot-voiced and <mark4>jolly</mark4><br>
Cried "Pretty Goblin" still for "Pretty <mark3>Polly;"--</mark3><br>
One whistled like a <mark3>bird.</mark3><br>
<br>
But sweet-tooth Laura spoke in <mark3>haste:</mark3><br>
"Good folk, I have no <mark4>coin;</mark4><br>
To take were to <mark3>purloin:</mark3><br>
I have no copper in my <mark4>purse,</mark4><br>
I have no silver <mark4>either,</mark4><br>
And all my gold is on the <mark5>furze</mark5><br>
That shakes in windy <mark1>weather</mark1><br>
Above the rusty <mark3>heather."</mark3><br>
"You have much gold upon your <mark1>head,"</mark1><br>
They answer'd all <mark1>together:</mark1><br>
"Buy from us with a golden <mark4>curl."</mark4><br>
She clipp'd a precious golden <mark4>lock,</mark4><br>
She dropp'd a tear more rare than <mark3>pearl,</mark3><br>
Then suck'd their fruit globes fair or <mark3>red:</mark3><br>
Sweeter than honey from the <mark3>rock,</mark3><br>
Stronger than man-rejoicing <mark4>wine,</mark4><br>
Clearer than water flow'd that <mark4>juice;</mark4><br>
She never tasted such <mark4>before,</mark4><br>
How should it cloy with length of <mark3>use?</mark3><br>
She suck'd and suck'd and suck'd the <mark3>more</mark3><br>
Fruits which that unknown orchard <mark3>bore;</mark3><br>
She suck'd until her lips were <mark3>sore;</mark3><br>
Then flung the emptied rinds <mark3>away</mark3><br>
But gather'd up one kernel <mark4>stone,</mark4><br>
And knew not was it night or <mark3>day</mark3><br>
As she turn'd home <mark3>alone.</mark3><br>
<br>
Lizzie met her at the <mark4>gate</mark4><br>
Full of wise upbraidings:<br>
"Dear, you should not stay so <mark3>late,</mark3><br>
Twilight is not good for <mark4>maidens;</mark4><br>
Should not loiter in the <mark1>glen</mark1><br>
In the haunts of goblin <mark1>men.</mark1><br>
Do you not remember <mark4>Jeanie,</mark4><br>
How she met them in the <mark4>moonlight,</mark4><br>
Took their gifts both choice and <mark4>many,</mark4><br>
Ate their fruits and wore their <mark4>flowers</mark4><br>
Pluck'd from <mark3>bowers</mark3><br>
Where summer ripens at all <mark3>hours?</mark3><br>
But ever in the noonlight<br>
She pined and pined <mark1>away;</mark1><br>
Sought them by night and <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
Found them no more, but dwindled and grew <mark3>grey;</mark3><br>
Then fell with the first <mark3>snow,</mark3><br>
While to this day no grass will <mark1>grow</mark1><br>
Where she lies <mark3>low:</mark3><br>
I planted daisies there a year <mark3>ago</mark3><br>
That never <mark1>blow.</mark1><br>
You should not loiter <mark3>so."</mark3><br>
"Nay, hush," said <mark1>Laura:</mark1><br>
"Nay, hush, my <mark4>sister:</mark4><br>
I ate and ate my <mark4>fill,</mark4><br>
Yet my mouth waters <mark3>still;</mark3><br>
To-morrow night I <mark3>will</mark3><br>
Buy more;" and kiss'd <mark1>her:</mark1><br>
"Have done with <mark5>sorrow;</mark5><br>
I'll bring you plums to-morrow<br>
Fresh on their mother <mark4>twigs,</mark4><br>
Cherries worth <mark4>getting;</mark4><br>
You cannot think what <mark3>figs</mark3><br>
My teeth have met <mark4>in,</mark4><br>
What melons <mark4>icy-cold</mark4><br>
Piled on a dish of <mark3>gold</mark3><br>
Too huge for me to <mark3>hold,</mark3><br>
What peaches with a velvet <mark3>nap,</mark3><br>
Pellucid grapes without one <mark4>seed:</mark4><br>
Odorous indeed must be the <mark3>mead</mark3><br>
Whereon they grow, and pure the wave they <mark4>drink</mark4><br>
With lilies at the <mark3>brink,</mark3><br>
And sugar-sweet their <mark3>sap."</mark3><br>
<br>
Golden head by golden <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
Like two pigeons in one <mark4>nest</mark4><br>
Folded in each other's <mark4>wings,</mark4><br>
They lay down in their curtain'd <mark3>bed:</mark3><br>
Like two blossoms on one <mark3>stem,</mark3><br>
Like two flakes of new-fall'n <mark1>snow,</mark1><br>
Like two wands of <mark4>ivory</mark4><br>
Tipp'd with gold for awful <mark3>kings.</mark3><br>
Moon and stars gaz'd in at <mark3>them,</mark3><br>
Wind sang to them lullaby,<br>
Lumbering owls forbore to <mark1>fly,</mark1><br>
Not a bat flapp'd to and <mark3>fro</mark3><br>
Round their <mark3>rest:</mark3><br>
Cheek to cheek and breast to <mark3>breast</mark3><br>
Lock'd together in one <mark1>nest.</mark1><br>
<br>
Early in the <mark4>morning</mark4><br>
When the first cock crow'd his <mark3>warning,</mark3><br>
Neat like bees, as sweet and <mark4>busy,</mark4><br>
Laura rose with <mark1>Lizzie:</mark1><br>
Fetch'd in honey, milk'd the <mark4>cows,</mark4><br>
Air'd and set to rights the <mark4>house,</mark4><br>
Kneaded cakes of whitest <mark4>wheat,</mark4><br>
Cakes for dainty mouths to <mark3>eat,</mark3><br>
Next churn'd butter, whipp'd up <mark4>cream,</mark4><br>
Fed their poultry, sat and <mark4>sew'd;</mark4><br>
Talk'd as modest maidens <mark4>should:</mark4><br>
Lizzie with an open <mark4>heart,</mark4><br>
Laura in an absent <mark3>dream,</mark3><br>
One <mark4>content</mark4>, one sick in <mark3>part;</mark3><br>
One warbling for the mere bright day's <mark4>delight,</mark4><br>
One longing for the <mark3>night.</mark3><br>
<br>
At length slow evening <mark4>came:</mark4><br>
They went with pitchers to the reedy <mark1>brook;</mark1><br>
Lizzie most placid in her <mark1>look,</mark1><br>
Laura most like a leaping <mark3>flame.</mark3><br>
They drew the gurgling water from its <mark4>deep;</mark4><br>
Lizzie pluck'd purple and rich golden <mark4>flags,</mark4><br>
Then turning homeward said: "The sunset <mark4>flushes</mark4><br>
Those furthest loftiest <mark5>crags;</mark5><br>
Come, Laura, not another maiden <mark4>lags.</mark4><br>
No wilful squirrel <mark3>wags,</mark3><br>
The beasts and birds are fast <mark3>asleep."</mark3><br>
But Laura loiter'd still among the <mark1>rushes</mark1><br>
And said the bank was <mark3>steep.</mark3><br>
<br>
And said the hour was early <mark1>still</mark1><br>
The dew not fall'n, the wind not <mark3>chill;</mark3><br>
Listening ever, but not <mark4>catching</mark4><br>
The customary <mark1>cry,</mark1><br>
"Come <mark1>buy</mark1>, come <mark1>buy,"</mark1><br>
With its iterated <mark4>jingle</mark4><br>
Of sugar-baited <mark4>words:</mark4><br>
Not for all her <mark4>watching</mark4><br>
Once discerning even one <mark3>goblin</mark3><br>
Racing, whisking, <mark4>tumbling</mark4>, <mark4>hobbling;</mark4><br>
Let alone the <mark3>herds</mark3><br>
That used to tramp along the <mark1>glen,</mark1><br>
In groups or <mark3>single,</mark3><br>
Of brisk fruit-merchant <mark1>men.</mark1><br>
<br>
Till Lizzie urged, "O Laura, <mark4>come;</mark4><br>
I hear the fruit-call but I dare not <mark1>look:</mark1><br>
You should not loiter longer at this <mark1>brook:</mark1><br>
Come with me <mark4>home.</mark4><br>
The stars rise, the moon bends her <mark4>arc,</mark4><br>
Each glowworm winks her <mark3>spark,</mark3><br>
Let us get home before the night grows <mark3>dark:</mark3><br>
For clouds may <mark4>gather</mark4><br>
Though this is summer <mark1>weather,</mark1><br>
Put out the lights and drench us <mark3>through;</mark3><br>
Then if we lost our way what should we <mark3>do?"</mark3><br>
<br>
Laura turn'd cold as <mark1>stone</mark1><br>
To find her sister heard that cry <mark1>alone,</mark1><br>
That goblin <mark1>cry,</mark1><br>
"Come buy our fruits, come <mark1>buy."</mark1><br>
Must she then buy no more such dainty <mark4>fruit?</mark4><br>
Must she no more such succous pasture <mark4>find,</mark4><br>
Gone deaf and <mark3>blind?</mark3><br>
Her tree of life droop'd from the <mark3>root:</mark3><br>
She said not one word in her heart's sore <mark4>ache;</mark4><br>
But peering thro' the dimness, nought <mark4>discerning,</mark4><br>
Trudg'd home, her pitcher dripping all the <mark3>way;</mark3><br>
So crept to bed, and <mark3>lay</mark3><br>
Silent till Lizzie <mark4>slept;</mark4><br>
Then sat up in a passionate <mark3>yearning,</mark3><br>
And gnash'd her teeth for baulk'd desire, and <mark3>wept</mark3><br>
As if her heart would <mark3>break.</mark3><br>
<br>
Day after day, night after <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
Laura kept watch in <mark4>vain</mark4><br>
In sullen silence of exceeding <mark3>pain.</mark3><br>
She never caught again the goblin <mark1>cry:</mark1><br>
"Come <mark1>buy</mark1>, come <mark1>buy;"--</mark1><br>
She never spied the goblin <mark1>men</mark1><br>
Hawking their fruits along the <mark1>glen:</mark1><br>
But when the noon wax'd <mark3>bright</mark3><br>
Her hair grew thin and <mark1>grey;</mark1><br>
She dwindled, as the fair full moon doth <mark4>turn</mark4><br>
To swift decay and <mark3>burn</mark3><br>
Her fire <mark1>away.</mark1><br>
<br>
One day remembering her <mark4>kernel-stone</mark4><br>
She set it by a wall that faced the <mark1>south;</mark1><br>
Dew'd it with tears, hoped for a <mark1>root,</mark1><br>
Watch'd for a waxing <mark3>shoot,</mark3><br>
But there came <mark4>none;</mark4><br>
It never saw the <mark3>sun,</mark3><br>
It never felt the trickling moisture <mark3>run:</mark3><br>
While with sunk eyes and faded <mark1>mouth</mark1><br>
She dream'd of <mark4>melons</mark4>, as a traveller <mark4>sees</mark4><br>
False waves in desert <mark1>drouth</mark1><br>
With shade of leaf-crown'd <mark3>trees,</mark3><br>
And burns the thirstier in the sandful <mark3>breeze.</mark3><br>
<br>
She no more swept the <mark1>house,</mark1><br>
Tended the fowls or <mark1>cows,</mark1><br>
Fetch'd honey, kneaded cakes of <mark1>wheat,</mark1><br>
Brought water from the <mark1>brook:</mark1><br>
But sat down listless in the <mark3>chimney-nook</mark3><br>
And would not <mark1>eat.</mark1><br>
<br>
Tender Lizzie could not <mark4>bear</mark4><br>
To watch her sister's cankerous <mark3>care</mark3><br>
Yet not to <mark3>share.</mark3><br>
She night and <mark1>morning</mark1><br>
Caught the goblins' <mark1>cry:</mark1><br>
"Come buy our orchard <mark1>fruits,</mark1><br>
Come <mark1>buy</mark1>, come <mark1>buy;"--</mark1><br>
Beside the brook, along the <mark1>glen,</mark1><br>
She heard the tramp of goblin <mark1>men,</mark1><br>
The yoke and <mark1>stir</mark1><br>
Poor Laura could not <mark1>hear;</mark1><br>
Long'd to buy fruit to comfort <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
But fear'd to pay too <mark4>dear.</mark4><br>
She thought of Jeanie in her <mark4>grave,</mark4><br>
Who should have been a <mark4>bride;</mark4><br>
But who for joys brides hope to <mark4>have</mark4><br>
Fell sick and <mark3>died</mark3><br>
In her gay <mark4>prime,</mark4><br>
In earliest winter <mark3>time</mark3><br>
With the first glazing rime,<br>
With the first snow-fall of crisp winter <mark1>time.</mark1><br>
<br>
Till Laura <mark4>dwindling</mark4><br>
Seem'd knocking at Death's <mark4>door:</mark4><br>
Then Lizzie weigh'd no <mark1>more</mark1><br>
Better and <mark4>worse;</mark4><br>
But put a silver penny in her <mark1>purse,</mark1><br>
Kiss'd Laura, cross'd the heath with clumps of <mark1>furze</mark1><br>
At twilight, halted by the <mark1>brook:</mark1><br>
And for the first time in her <mark3>life</mark3><br>
Began to listen and <mark1>look.</mark1><br>
<br>
Laugh'd every <mark1>goblin</mark1><br>
When they spied her <mark4>peeping:</mark4><br>
Came towards her <mark1>hobbling,</mark1><br>
Flying, <mark4>running</mark4>, <mark4>leaping,</mark4><br>
Puffing and <mark4>blowing,</mark4><br>
Chuckling, <mark4>clapping</mark4>, <mark3>crowing,</mark3><br>
Clucking and <mark4>gobbling,</mark4><br>
Mopping and <mark4>mowing,</mark4><br>
Full of airs and <mark4>graces,</mark4><br>
Pulling wry <mark3>faces,</mark3><br>
Demure <mark4>grimaces,</mark4><br>
Cat-like and <mark4>rat-like,</mark4><br>
Ratel- and <mark3>wombat-like,</mark3><br>
Snail-paced in a <mark4>hurry,</mark4><br>
Parrot-voiced and <mark4>whistler,</mark4><br>
Helter skelter, hurry <mark1>skurry,</mark1><br>
Chattering like <mark4>magpies,</mark4><br>
Fluttering like <mark4>pigeons,</mark4><br>
Gliding like <mark4>fishes,--</mark4><br>
Hugg'd her and kiss'd <mark1>her:</mark1><br>
Squeez'd and caress'd <mark1>her:</mark1><br>
Stretch'd up their <mark3>dishes,</mark3><br>
Panniers, and <mark4>plates:</mark4><br>
"Look at our <mark4>apples</mark4><br>
Russet and <mark4>dun,</mark4><br>
Bob at our <mark1>cherries,</mark1><br>
Bite at our <mark1>peaches,</mark1><br>
Citrons and <mark3>dates,</mark3><br>
Grapes for the <mark4>asking,</mark4><br>
Pears red with <mark3>basking</mark3><br>
Out in the <mark1>sun,</mark1><br>
Plums on their <mark1>twigs;</mark1><br>
Pluck them and suck <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
Pomegranates, <mark1>figs."--</mark1><br>
<br>
"Good folk," said <mark1>Lizzie,</mark1><br>
Mindful of <mark1>Jeanie:</mark1><br>
"Give me much and many: <mark1>--</mark1><br>
Held out her <mark4>apron,</mark4><br>
Toss'd them her <mark3>penny.</mark3><br>
"Nay, take a seat with <mark1>us,</mark1><br>
Honour and eat with <mark1>us,"</mark1><br>
They answer'd <mark4>grinning:</mark4><br>
"Our feast is but <mark3>beginning.</mark3><br>
Night yet is <mark4>early,</mark4><br>
Warm and <mark3>dew-pearly,</mark3><br>
Wakeful and <mark5>starry:</mark5><br>
Such fruits as <mark4>these</mark4><br>
No man can <mark4>carry:</mark4><br>
Half their bloom would <mark1>fly,</mark1><br>
Half their dew would <mark3>dry,</mark3><br>
Half their flavour would pass <mark1>by.</mark1><br>
Sit down and feast with <mark1>us,</mark1><br>
Be welcome guest with <mark1>us,</mark1><br>
Cheer you and rest with <mark1>us."--</mark1><br>
"Thank you," said Lizzie: "But one <mark4>waits</mark4><br>
At home alone for <mark3>me:</mark3><br>
So without further <mark5>parleying,</mark5><br>
If you will not sell me <mark4>any</mark4><br>
Of your fruits though much and <mark1>many,</mark1><br>
Give me back my silver <mark1>penny</mark1><br>
I toss'd you for a <mark3>fee."--</mark3><br>
They began to scratch their <mark3>pates,</mark3><br>
No longer <mark4>wagging</mark4>, <mark4>purring,</mark4><br>
But visibly <mark3>demurring,</mark3><br>
Grunting and <mark4>snarling.</mark4><br>
One call'd her <mark4>proud,</mark4><br>
Cross-grain'd, <mark4>uncivil;</mark4><br>
Their tones wax'd <mark3>loud,</mark3><br>
Their looks were <mark4>evil.</mark4><br>
Lashing their <mark4>tails</mark4><br>
They trod and hustled <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
Elbow'd and jostled <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
Claw'd with their <mark3>nails,</mark3><br>
Barking, mewing, <mark4>hissing</mark4>, <mark4>mocking,</mark4><br>
Tore her gown and soil'd her <mark3>stocking,</mark3><br>
Twitch'd her hair out by the <mark1>roots,</mark1><br>
Stamp'd upon her tender <mark3>feet,</mark3><br>
Held her hands and squeez'd their <mark1>fruits</mark1><br>
Against her mouth to make her <mark1>eat.</mark1><br>
<br>
White and golden Lizzie <mark4>stood,</mark4><br>
Like a lily in a <mark4>flood,--</mark4><br>
Like a rock of blue-vein'd <mark1>stone</mark1><br>
Lash'd by tides obstreperously,--<br>
Like a beacon left <mark1>alone</mark1><br>
In a hoary roaring <mark3>sea,</mark3><br>
Sending up a golden <mark4>fire,--</mark4><br>
Like a fruit-crown'd <mark3>orange-tree</mark3><br>
White with blossoms <mark3>honey-sweet</mark3><br>
Sore beset by wasp and <mark3>bee,--</mark3><br>
Like a royal virgin <mark1>town</mark1><br>
Topp'd with gilded dome and <mark3>spire</mark3><br>
Close beleaguer'd by a <mark3>fleet</mark3><br>
Mad to tug her standard <mark1>down.</mark1><br>
<br>
One may lead a horse to <mark4>water,</mark4><br>
Twenty cannot make him <mark1>drink.</mark1><br>
Though the goblins cuff'd and caught <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
Coax'd and fought <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
Bullied and besought <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
Scratch'd her, pinch'd her black as <mark3>ink,</mark3><br>
Kick'd and knock'd <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
Maul'd and mock'd <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
Lizzie utter'd not a <mark1>word;</mark1><br>
Would not open lip from <mark4>lip</mark4><br>
Lest they should cram a mouthful <mark1>in:</mark1><br>
But laugh'd in heart to feel the <mark3>drip</mark3><br>
Of juice that syrupp'd all her <mark1>face,</mark1><br>
And lodg'd in dimples of her <mark3>chin,</mark3><br>
And streak'd her neck which quaked like <mark3>curd.</mark3><br>
At last the evil <mark4>people,</mark4><br>
Worn out by her <mark4>resistance,</mark4><br>
Flung back her penny, kick'd their <mark1>fruit</mark1><br>
Along whichever road they <mark4>took,</mark4><br>
Not leaving root or stone or <mark1>shoot;</mark1><br>
Some writh'd into the <mark4>ground,</mark4><br>
Some div'd into the <mark1>brook</mark1><br>
With ring and <mark4>ripple,</mark4><br>
Some scudded on the gale without a <mark3>sound,</mark3><br>
Some vanish'd in the <mark3>distance.</mark3><br>
<br>
In a smart, ache, <mark4>tingle,</mark4><br>
Lizzie went her <mark1>way;</mark1><br>
Knew not was it night or <mark1>day;</mark1><br>
Sprang up the bank, tore thro' the <mark1>furze,</mark1><br>
Threaded copse and <mark3>dingle,</mark3><br>
And heard her penny <mark1>jingle</mark1><br>
Bouncing in her <mark1>purse,--</mark1><br>
Its bounce was music to her <mark4>ear.</mark4><br>
She ran and <mark1>ran</mark1><br>
As if she fear'd some goblin <mark1>man</mark1><br>
Dogg'd her with gibe or <mark3>curse</mark3><br>
Or something <mark1>worse:</mark1><br>
But not one goblin scurried <mark4>after,</mark4><br>
Nor was she prick'd by <mark3>fear;</mark3><br>
The kind heart made her <mark4>windy-paced</mark4><br>
That urged her home quite out of breath with <mark1>haste</mark1><br>
And inward <mark3>laughter.</mark3><br>
<br>
She cried, "Laura," up the <mark4>garden,</mark4><br>
"Did you miss <mark1>me?</mark1><br>
Come and kiss <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
Never mind my <mark4>bruises,</mark4><br>
Hug me, kiss me, suck my <mark4>juices</mark4><br>
Squeez'd from goblin fruits for <mark3>you,</mark3><br>
Goblin pulp and goblin <mark3>dew.</mark3><br>
Eat <mark1>me</mark1>, drink me, love <mark1>me;</mark1><br>
Laura, make much of <mark1>me;</mark1><br>
For your sake I have braved the <mark1>glen</mark1><br>
And had to do with goblin merchant <mark1>men."</mark1><br>
<br>
Laura started from her <mark4>chair,</mark4><br>
Flung her arms up in the <mark3>air,</mark3><br>
Clutch'd her <mark3>hair:</mark3><br>
"Lizzie, Lizzie, have you <mark4>tasted</mark4><br>
For my sake the fruit <mark4>forbidden?</mark4><br>
Must your light like mine be <mark3>hidden,</mark3><br>
Your young life like mine be <mark3>wasted,</mark3><br>
Undone in mine <mark4>undoing,</mark4><br>
And ruin'd in my <mark4>ruin,</mark4><br>
Thirsty, canker'd, <mark4>goblin-ridden?"--</mark4><br>
She clung about her <mark1>sister,</mark1><br>
Kiss'd and kiss'd and kiss'd <mark1>her:</mark1><br>
Tears once <mark4>again</mark4><br>
Refresh'd her shrunken <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
Dropping like <mark3>rain</mark3><br>
After long sultry <mark1>drouth;</mark1><br>
Shaking with aguish fear, and <mark1>pain,</mark1><br>
She kiss'd and kiss'd her with a hungry <mark1>mouth.</mark1><br>
<br>
Her lips began to <mark4>scorch,</mark4><br>
That juice was wormwood to her <mark4>tongue,</mark4><br>
She loath'd the <mark4>feast:</mark4><br>
Writhing as one possess'd she leap'd and <mark3>sung,</mark3><br>
Rent all her robe, and <mark3>wrung</mark3><br>
Her hands in lamentable <mark1>haste,</mark1><br>
And beat her <mark1>breast.</mark1><br>
Her locks stream'd like the <mark3>torch</mark3><br>
Borne by a racer at full <mark4>speed,</mark4><br>
Or like the mane of horses in their <mark4>flight,</mark4><br>
Or like an eagle when she stems the <mark3>light</mark3><br>
Straight toward the <mark1>sun,</mark1><br>
Or like a caged thing <mark3>freed,</mark3><br>
Or like a flying flag when armies <mark1>run.</mark1><br>
<br>
Swift fire spread through her veins, knock'd at her <mark1>heart,</mark1><br>
Met the fire smouldering <mark3>there</mark3><br>
And overbore its lesser <mark1>flame;</mark1><br>
She gorged on bitterness without a <mark3>name:</mark3><br>
Ah! fool, to choose such <mark1>part</mark1><br>
Of soul-consuming <mark1>care!</mark1><br>
Sense fail'd in the mortal <mark3>strife:</mark3><br>
Like the watch-tower of a <mark1>town</mark1><br>
Which an earthquake shatters <mark1>down,</mark1><br>
Like a lightning-stricken <mark4>mast,</mark4><br>
Like a wind-uprooted <mark3>tree</mark3><br>
Spun <mark4>about,</mark4><br>
Like a foam-topp'd <mark5>waterspout</mark5><br>
Cast down headlong in the <mark1>sea,</mark1><br>
She fell at <mark4>last;</mark4><br>
Pleasure past and anguish <mark3>past,</mark3><br>
Is it death or is it <mark1>life?</mark1><br>
<br>
Life out of <mark4>death.</mark4><br>
That night long Lizzie watch'd by <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
Counted her pulse's flagging <mark1>stir,</mark1><br>
Felt for her <mark3>breath,</mark3><br>
Held water to her <mark4>lips</mark4>, and cool'd her <mark1>face</mark1><br>
With tears and fanning <mark4>leaves:</mark4><br>
But when the first birds chirp'd about their <mark3>eaves,</mark3><br>
And early reapers plodded to the <mark3>place</mark3><br>
Of golden <mark3>sheaves,</mark3><br>
And dew-wet <mark4>grass</mark4><br>
Bow'd in the morning winds so brisk to <mark3>pass,</mark3><br>
And new buds with new <mark1>day</mark1><br>
Open'd of cup-like lilies on the <mark4>stream,</mark4><br>
Laura awoke as from a <mark1>dream,</mark1><br>
Laugh'd in the innocent old <mark1>way,</mark1><br>
Hugg'd Lizzie but not twice or <mark4>thrice;</mark4><br>
Her gleaming locks show'd not one thread of <mark1>grey,</mark1><br>
Her breath was sweet as <mark3>May</mark3><br>
And light danced in her <mark1>eyes.</mark1><br>
<br>
Days, weeks, months, <mark4>years</mark4><br>
<mark4>Afterwards</mark4>, when both were <mark4>wives</mark4><br>
With children of their <mark4>own;</mark4><br>
Their mother-hearts beset with <mark4>fears,</mark4><br>
Their lives bound up in tender <mark4>lives;</mark4><br>
Laura would call the little <mark4>ones</mark4><br>
And tell them of her early <mark1>prime,</mark1><br>
Those pleasant days long <mark1>gone</mark1><br>
Of not-returning <mark1>time:</mark1><br>
Would talk about the haunted <mark1>glen,</mark1><br>
The wicked, quaint fruit-merchant <mark1>men,</mark1><br>
Their fruits like honey to the <mark4>throat</mark4><br>
But poison in the <mark4>blood;</mark4><br>
(Men sell not such in any <mark1>town):</mark1><br>
Would tell them how her sister <mark1>stood</mark1><br>
In deadly peril to do her <mark3>good,</mark3><br>
And win the fiery <mark4>antidote:</mark4><br>
Then joining hands to little <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
Would bid them cling <mark1>together,</mark1><br>
"For there is no friend like a <mark1>sister</mark1><br>
In calm or stormy <mark1>weather;</mark1><br>
To cheer one on the tedious <mark1>way,</mark1><br>
To fetch one if one goes <mark3>astray,</mark3><br>
To lift one if one totters <mark1>down,</mark1><br>
To strengthen whilst one <mark3>stands."</mark3><br>
