Title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 54 <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

Oh, yet we trust that somehow <mark4>good</mark4><br>
Will be the final end of <mark3>ill,</mark3><br>
To pangs of nature, sins of <mark3>will,</mark3><br>
Defects of doubt, and taints of <mark4>blood;</mark4><br>
<br>
That nothing walks with aimless <mark3>feet;</mark3><br>
That not one life shall be <mark5>destroy'd,</mark5><br>
Or cast as rubbish to the <mark4>void,</mark4><br>
When God hath made the pile <mark3>complete;</mark3><br>
<br>
That not a worm is cloven in <mark3>vain;</mark3><br>
That not a moth with vain <mark5>desire</mark5><br>
Is shrivell'd in a fruitless <mark3>fire,</mark3><br>
Or but subserves another's <mark3>gain.</mark3><br>
<br>
Behold, we know not <mark4>anything;</mark4><br>
I can but trust that good shall <mark4>fall</mark4><br>
At last--far off--at last, to <mark3>all,</mark3><br>
And every winter change to <mark4>spring.</mark4><br>
<br>
So runs my dream: but what am <mark3>I?</mark3><br>
An infant crying in the <mark4>night:</mark4><br>
An infant crying for the <mark3>light:</mark3><br>
And with no language but a <mark3>cry.</mark3><br>
