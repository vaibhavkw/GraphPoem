Title : County Fair <br>
Author : Mary Karr <br><br>

On the mudroad of plodding American <mark4>bodies,</mark4><br>
my son wove like an antelope from <mark5>stall</mark5><br>
to stall and want to want. I no'ed it all: the <mark4>wind-up</mark4><br>
killer robot and winged alien; <mark4>knives</mark4><br>
hierarchical in a glass case; the blow-up vinyl <mark4>wolf</mark4><br>
bobbing from a pilgrim's <mark4>staff.</mark4><br>
Lured as I was by the bar-b-que's black <mark4>smoke,</mark4><br>
I got in line. A hog <mark4>carcass,</mark4><br>
blistered pink on a spit, made its agonized slow <mark4>roll,</mark4><br>
a metaphor, I thought, for <mark4>anyone</mark4><br>
ahead of me--the pasty-faced and <mark4>broad</mark4>, I <mark4>half-longed</mark4><br>
for the titanium blade I'd just <mark4>seen</mark4><br>
curved like a falcon's claw. Some truth wanted <mark4>cutting</mark4><br>
in my neighbors' impermanent <mark1>flesh.</mark1><br>
Or so my poisoned soul announced, as if <mark4>scorn</mark4><br>
for the body <mark4>politic</mark4><br>
weren't some outward form of inner <mark1>scorn,</mark1><br>
         as if I were fit judge. <br>
Lucky my son found the bumper cars. Once I'd <mark4>hoped</mark4><br>
only to stand tall <mark4>enough</mark4><br>
to drive my <mark3>own</mark3>, Now when the master switch got <mark4>thrown</mark4><br>
and sparks skittered <mark4>overhead</mark4><br>
in a lightning web, I felt like Frankenstein or some   <br>
newly powered <mark4>monster.</mark4><br>
Plus the floor was glossy as ice. Even rammed <mark4>head-on,</mark4><br>
the rubber bumper bounced you off <mark4>unhurt</mark4><br>
and into other folks who didn't mind the jolt, whose <mark4>faces</mark4><br>
all broke smiles, in <mark4>fact,</mark4><br>
till the perfect figure-eight I'd started out to <mark4>execute</mark4><br>
became itself an interruption. One <mark4>face</mark4><br>
after another wheeled shining at me from the <mark4>dark,</mark4><br>
each bearing the weight of a whole <mark4>self.</mark4><br>
What pure vessels we are, I thought, once our <mark4>skulls</mark4><br>
shut up their nasty <mark4>talk.</mark4><br>
We drove home past corn at full tassel, colossal <mark4>silos,</mark4><br>
a windmill sentinel. Summer was <mark4>starting.</mark4><br>
My son's body slumped like a grain sack against <mark4>mine.</mark4><br>
My chest was all <mark4>thunder.</mark4><br>
On the purple sky in rear view, fireworks unpacked--silver   <br>
         chrysanthemum, another in fuchsia, <br>
then plum. Each staccato boom shook the night. My <mark4>son</mark4><br>
jerked in his <mark3>sleep</mark3>, I prayed hard to <mark4>keep</mark4><br>
the frail peace we hurtled through, to want no more <br>
than what we <mark4>had</mark4>, The <mark4>road</mark4><br>
rushed under us. Our lush planet heaved toward day.   <br>
Inside my hand's <mark1>flesh,</mark1><br>
anybody's skeleton gripped the <mark4>wheel.</mark4><br>
