Title : The Flat-Hunter's Way <br>
Author : Franklin Pierce Adams <br><br>

We don't get any too much <mark4>light;</mark4><br>
It's pretty noisy, too, at <mark4>that;</mark4><br>
The folks next door stay up all <mark4>night;</mark4><br>
There's but one closet in the <mark4>flat;</mark4><br>
The rent we pay is far from <mark3>low;</mark3><br>
Our flat is small and in the <mark3>rear;</mark3><br>
But we have looked around, and <mark3>so</mark3><br>
We think we'll stay another <mark3>year.</mark3><br>
<br>
Our dining-room is pretty <mark3>dark;</mark3><br>
Our kitchen's hot and very <mark3>small;</mark3><br>
The "view" we get of Central <mark3>Park</mark3><br>
We really do not get at <mark3>all.</mark3><br>
The ceiling cracks and crumbles <mark3>down</mark3><br>
Upon me while I'm working <mark4>here--</mark4><br>
But, after combing all the <mark3>town,</mark3><br>
We think we'll stay another <mark1>year.</mark1><br>
<br>
We are not "handy" to the <mark3>sub;</mark3><br>
Our hall-boy service is a <mark4>joke;</mark4><br>
Our janitor's a foreign <mark3>dub</mark3><br>
Who never does a thing but <mark3>smoke;</mark3><br>
Our landlord says he will not <mark4>cut</mark4><br>
A cent from rent already <mark3>dear;</mark3><br>
And so we sought for better--but <br>
We think we'll stay another <mark1>year.</mark1><br>
