Title : The Hospital Window <br>
Author : James L. Dickey <br><br>

I have just come down from my <mark4>father.</mark4><br>
Higher and higher he <mark4>lies</mark4><br>
Above me in a blue <mark4>light</mark4><br>
Shed by a tinted window. <br>
I drop through six white <mark4>floors</mark4><br>
And then step out onto <mark4>pavement.</mark4><br>
<br>
Still feeling my father <mark4>ascend,</mark4><br>
I start to cross the firm <mark4>street,</mark4><br>
My shoulder blades shining with <mark4>all</mark4><br>
The glass the huge building can <mark4>raise.</mark4><br>
Now I must turn round and face <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
And know his one pane from the <mark4>others.</mark4><br>
<br>
Each window possesses the <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
As though it burned there on a <mark4>wick.</mark4><br>
I wave, like a man catching <mark4>fire.</mark4><br>
All the deep-dyed windowpanes <mark5>flash,</mark5><br>
And, behind them, all the white <mark4>rooms</mark4><br>
They turn to the color of <mark4>Heaven.</mark4><br>
<br>
Ceremoniously, <mark4>gravely</mark4>, and <mark4>weakly,</mark4><br>
Dozens of pale hands are <mark4>waving</mark4><br>
Back, from inside their <mark4>flames.</mark4><br>
Yet one pure pane among <mark4>these</mark4><br>
Is the bright, erased blankness of <mark4>nothing.</mark4><br>
I know that my father is <mark4>there,</mark4><br>
<br>
In the shape of his death still <mark4>living.</mark4><br>
The traffic increases around <mark1>me</mark1><br>
Like a madness called down on my <mark4>head.</mark4><br>
The horns blast at me like <mark4>shotguns,</mark4><br>
And drivers lean out, driven <mark4>crazy--</mark4><br>
But now my propped-up <mark1>father</mark1><br>
<br>
Lifts his arm out of stillness at <mark4>last.</mark4><br>
The light from the window strikes <mark1>me</mark1><br>
And I turn as blue as a <mark4>soul,</mark4><br>
As the moment when I was <mark4>born.</mark4><br>
I am not afraid for my <mark1>father--</mark1><br>
Look! He is grinning; he is <mark4>not</mark4><br>
<br>
Afraid for my life, <mark4>either,</mark4><br>
As the wild engines stand at my <mark4>knees</mark4><br>
Shredding their gears and <mark4>roaring,</mark4><br>
And I hold each car in its <mark4>place</mark4><br>
For miles, inciting its <mark3>horn</mark3><br>
To blow down the walls of the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
<br>
That the dying may float without <mark4>fear</mark4><br>
In the bold blue gaze of my <mark1>father.</mark1><br>
Slowly I move to the <mark4>sidewalk</mark4><br>
With my pin-tingling hand half <mark4>dead</mark4><br>
At the end of my bloodless arm. <br>
I carry it off in <mark4>amazement,</mark4><br>
<br>
High, still higher, still <mark1>waving,</mark1><br>
My recognized face fully <mark4>mortal,</mark4><br>
Yet not; not at <mark4>all</mark4>, in the <mark4>pale,</mark4><br>
Drained, otherworldly, <mark4>stricken,</mark4><br>
Created hue of stained <mark4>glass.</mark4><br>
I have just come down from my <mark1>father.</mark1><br>
