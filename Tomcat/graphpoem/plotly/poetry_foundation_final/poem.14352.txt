Title : In the Cold Country<br>
Author : Barbara Howes<br><br>

We came so trustingly, for love, but <mark4>these</mark4><br>
Lowlands, flatlands, near beneath the <mark3>sea</mark3><br>
Point with their cautionary bones of <mark3>sand</mark3><br>
To exorcize, submerge us; we stay <mark3>free</mark3><br>
Only as mermaids glittering in the <mark4>waves:</mark4><br>
Mermaids of the imagination, young   <br>
A spring ago, who know our loveliness   <br>
Banished, like fireflies at winter's <mark4>breath,</mark4><br>
Because none saw; these vines about our <mark4>necks</mark4><br>
We placed in welcome once, but now as <mark4>wreath</mark4><br>
Against the scalpel cold; still cold creeps <mark4>in</mark4><br>
To grow like ivy over our chilling <mark4>bodies</mark4><br>
Into our blood. Now in our diamond <mark4>dress</mark4><br>
We wive only the sequins of the <mark1>sea.</mark1><br>
The lowlands have rejected us. They lie   <br>
Athwart the whispering waters like a <mark3>scar</mark3><br>
On a mirage of glass; the dooming <mark3>land,</mark3><br>
Where nothing can take root but frost, has <mark4>won.</mark4><br>
And what of warmth and what of joy? They <mark3>are</mark3><br>
Sequestered elsewhere, southward, where the <mark3>sun</mark3><br>
<mark4>Speaks</mark4>, For all our mermaid <mark4>vigilance</mark4><br>
And balance, all goes under; <mark3>underneath</mark3><br>
The land's gray wave we falter and fall back   <br>
To hibernate within the caves of <mark4>death.</mark4><br>
