Title : Concerning My Neighbors, the Hittites <br>
Author : Charles Simic <br><br>

Great are the <mark1>Hittites.</mark1><br>
Their ears have mice and mice have <mark4>holes.</mark4><br>
Their dogs bury themselves and leave the <mark4>bones</mark4><br>
To guard the house. A single weed holds all their <mark4>storms</mark4><br>
Until the spiderwebs spread over the <mark4>heavens.</mark4><br>
There are bits of straw in their lakes and <mark4>rivers</mark4><br>
Looking for drowned men. When a camel won't <mark4>pass</mark4><br>
Through the eye of one of their <mark4>needles,</mark4><br>
They tie a house to its tail. Great are the <mark1>Hittites.</mark1><br>
Their fathers are in cradles, their newborn make <mark4>war.</mark4><br>
To them lead floats, a leaf sinks. Their god is the <mark4>size</mark4><br>
Of a mustard seed so that he can be quickly eaten. <br>
<br>
They also piss against the <mark4>wind,</mark4><br>
Pour water in a leaky <mark4>bucket.</mark4><br>
Strike two tears to make <mark4>fire,</mark4><br>
And have tongues with bones in <mark4>them,</mark4><br>
Bones of a wolf gnawed by <mark4>lambs.</mark4><br>
<br>
They are also called mound <mark4>builders,</mark4><br>
<br>
They are called Asiatic <mark4>horses</mark4><br>
That will drink on the Rhine, they are <mark4>called</mark4><br>
My grandmother's fortune-telling, they are <mark1>called</mark1><br>
You can't take it to the grave with <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
It's that hum in your left <mark4>ear,</mark4><br>
<br>
A sigh coming from deep within <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
A dream in which you keep falling <mark4>forever,</mark4><br>
The hour in which you sit up in <mark4>bed</mark4><br>
As though someone has shouted your <mark4>name.</mark4><br>
No one knows why the Hittites <mark4>exist,</mark4><br>
<br>
Still, when two are <mark4>whispering</mark4><br>
One of them is <mark4>listening.</mark4><br>
Did they catch the falling knife? <br>
<br>
They caught it like a fly with closed <mark4>mouths.</mark4><br>
Did they balance the last <mark4>egg?</mark4><br>
They struck the egg with a bone so it won't <mark4>howl.</mark4><br>
Did they wait for dead man's <mark4>shoes?</mark4><br>
The shoes went in at one ear and out the <mark4>other.</mark4><br>
Did they wipe the blood from their <mark5>mousetraps?</mark5><br>
They burnt the blood to warm <mark4>themselves.</mark4><br>
Are they cold with no pockets in their <mark4>shrouds?</mark4><br>
If the sky falls, they shall have clouds for <mark4>supper.</mark4><br>
What do they have for <mark4>us</mark4><br>
<br>
To put in our pipes and <mark4>smoke?</mark4><br>
They have the braid of a beautiful <mark4>girl</mark4><br>
That drew a team of <mark4>cattle</mark4><br>
And the engraving of him who <mark4>slept</mark4><br>
With dogs and rose with <mark4>fleas</mark4><br>
Searching for its trace in the <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
And so there are fewer and fewer of them <mark3>now.</mark3><br>
<br>
Who wrote their name on <mark4>paper</mark4><br>
<br>
And burnt the paper? Who put snake <mark1>bones</mark1><br>
In their pillows? Who threw nail parings   <br>
In their soup? Who made them <mark4>walk</mark4><br>
Under the ladder? Who stuck <mark4>pins</mark4><br>
In their <mark4>snapshots?</mark4><br>
The wart of warts and his brother evil <mark3>eye.</mark3><br>
Bone-lazy and her sister <mark4>rabbit's-foot.</mark4><br>
<br>
Cross-your-fingers and their father dog <mark4>star.</mark4><br>
Knock-on-wood and his mother <mark4>hellfire.</mark4><br>
Because the tail can't wag the <mark3>cow.</mark3><br>
Because the woods can't fly to the dove.   <br>
<br>
Because the stones haven't said their last <mark4>word.</mark4><br>
Because dunghills rise and empires <mark4>fall.</mark4><br>
They are leaving <mark4>behind</mark4><br>
All the silver <mark4>spoons</mark4><br>
<br>
Found inside their throats at <mark3>birth,</mark3><br>
<br>
A hand they bit because it fed <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
Two rats from a ship that is still <mark4>sinking,</mark4><br>
A collection of various split <mark4>hairs,</mark4><br>
The leaf they turned over too <mark4>late.</mark4><br>
<br>
All that salt cast over the <mark4>shoulder,</mark4><br>
All that bloody meat traveling under the saddles of nomads <mark4>...</mark4><br>
Here comes a forest in wolf's <mark4>clothing,</mark4><br>
<br>
The wise hen bows to the umbrella. <br>
<br>
When the bloodshot evening meets the bloodshot <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
They tell each other bloodshot <mark4>tales.</mark4><br>
<br>
That bare branch over them speaks louder than <mark4>words.</mark4><br>
The moon is worn <mark4>threadbare.</mark4><br>
<br>
I repeat: lean days don't come <mark5>singly,</mark5><br>
It takes all kinds to make the sun <mark4>rise.</mark4><br>
<br>
The night is each man's <mark4>castle.</mark4><br>
Don't let the castle out of the <mark4>bag.</mark4><br>
<br>
Wind in the valley, wind in the high <mark4>hills,</mark4><br>
Practice will make this body fit this <mark1>bed.</mark1><br>
<br>
May all roads <mark3>lead</mark3><br>
Out of a sow's <mark1>ear</mark1><br>
<br>
To what's <mark3>worth</mark3><br>
Two in the bush.<br>
