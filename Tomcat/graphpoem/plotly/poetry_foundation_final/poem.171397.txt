Title : The Man Splitting Wood in the Daybreak <br>
Author : Galway Kinnell <br><br>

The man splitting wood in the <mark1>daybreak</mark1><br>
looks strong, as though, if one <mark4>weakened,</mark4><br>
one could turn to him and he would help.   <br>
Gus Newland was strong. When he split <mark4>wood</mark4><br>
he struck hard, flashing the bright <mark4>steel</mark4><br>
through the air so hard the hard <mark4>maple</mark4><br>
leapt apart, as it's feared marriages will <mark1>do</mark1><br>
in countries reluctant to permit divorce,   <br>
and even willow, which, though <mark4>stacked</mark4><br>
to dry a full year, on being <mark4>split</mark4><br>
actually weeps--totem wood, <mark5>therefore,</mark5><br>
to the <mark4>married-until-death--sunders</mark4><br>
with many little lip-wetting <mark4>gasp-noises.</mark4><br>
But Gus is dead. We could turn to our <mark4>fathers,</mark4><br>
but they help us only by the unperplexed   <br>
looking-back of the numerals cut into <mark4>headstones.</mark4><br>
Or to our mothers, whose love, so <mark4>devastated,</mark4><br>
can't, even in spring, break through the hard earth.   <br>
Our spouses weaken at the same rate we <mark1>do.</mark1><br>
We have to hold our children up to lean on <mark5>them.</mark5><br>
Everyone who could help goes or hasn't <mark4>arrived.</mark4><br>
What about the man splitting wood in the <mark1>daybreak,</mark1><br>
who looked strong? That was years ago. That was me.<br>
