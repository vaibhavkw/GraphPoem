Title : A Dirge<br>
Author : Thomas James Merton<br><br>

Some one who hears the bugle neigh will know   <br>
How cold it is when sentries die by <mark4>starlight.</mark4><br>
<br>
But none who love to hear the hammering drum   <br>
Will look, when the betrayer <br>
Laughs in the desert like a broken <mark4>monument,</mark4><br>
Ringing his tongue in the red bell of his <mark4>head,</mark4><br>
Gesturing like a flag. <br>
<br>
The air that quivered after the <mark4>earthquake</mark4><br>
(When God died like a thief) <br>
Still plays the ancient forums like <mark4>pianos;</mark4><br>
The treacherous <mark4>wind</mark4>, lover of the <mark4>demented,</mark4><br>
Will harp forever in the haunted <mark4>temples.</mark4><br>
<br>
What speeches do the birds <mark4>make</mark4><br>
With their beaks, to the desolate <mark4>dead?</mark4><br>
And yet we love those carsick <mark4>amphitheaters,</mark4><br>
Nor hear our Messenger come home from <mark4>hell</mark4><br>
With hands shot full of <mark4>blood.</mark4><br>
<br>
No one who loves the fleering fife will <mark4>feel</mark4><br>
The light of morning stab his flesh, <br>
But some who hear the trumpet's raving, in the ruined sky, <br>
Will dread the burnished helmet of the sun,   <br>
Whose anger goes before the King.<br>
