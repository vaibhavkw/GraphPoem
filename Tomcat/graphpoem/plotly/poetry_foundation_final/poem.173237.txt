Title : Fragment 7: When Hope but made Tranquillity be felt <br>
Author : Samuel Taylor Coleridge <br><br>

<br>
When Hope but made Tranquillity be felt?<br>
A Flight of Hopes for ever on the <mark3>wing</mark3><br>
But made Tranquillity a conscious <mark3>Thing?</mark3><br>
And wheeling round and round in sportive <mark3>coil</mark3><br>
Fann'd the calm air upon the brow of <mark3>Toil?</mark3><br>
