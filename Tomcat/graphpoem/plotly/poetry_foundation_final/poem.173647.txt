Title : The Flaneur <br>
Author : Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. <br><br>

Boston Common, December 6, 1882 during the Transit of <mark4>Venus</mark4><br>
I love all sights of earth and <mark3>skies,</mark3><br>
From flowers that glow to stars that <mark3>shine;</mark3><br>
The comet and the penny <mark3>show,</mark3><br>
All curious things, above, <mark3>below,</mark3><br>
Hold each in turn my wandering <mark3>eyes:</mark3><br>
I claim the Christian Pagan's <mark3>line,</mark3><br>
Humani nihil,--even <mark3>so,--</mark3><br>
And is not human life <mark3>divine?</mark3><br>
<br>
When soft the western breezes <mark3>blow,</mark3><br>
And strolling youths meet sauntering <mark4>maids,</mark4><br>
I love to watch the stirring <mark3>trades</mark3><br>
Beneath the Vallombrosa <mark3>shades</mark3><br>
Our much-enduring elms <mark3>bestow;</mark3><br>
The vender and his rhetoric's <mark3>flow,</mark3><br>
That lambent stream of liquid <mark4>lies;</mark4><br>
The bait he dangles from his <mark1>line,</mark1><br>
The gudgeon and his gold-washed <mark3>prize.</mark3><br>
I halt before the blazoned <mark3>sign</mark3><br>
That bids me linger to <mark3>admire</mark3><br>
The drama time can never <mark3>tire,</mark3><br>
The little hero of the <mark3>hunch,</mark3><br>
With iron arm and soul of <mark3>fire,</mark3><br>
And will that works his fierce <mark3>desire,--</mark3><br>
Untamed, unscared, unconquered <mark3>Punch!</mark3><br>
My ear a pleasing torture <mark4>finds</mark4><br>
In tones the withered sibyl <mark3>grinds,--</mark3><br>
The dame sans merci's broken <mark4>strain,</mark4><br>
Whom I erewhile, perchance, have <mark4>known,</mark4><br>
When Orleans filled the Bourbon <mark3>throne,</mark3><br>
A siren singing by the <mark4>Seine.</mark4><br>
<br>
But most I love the tube that <mark4>spies</mark4><br>
The orbs celestial in their <mark4>march;</mark4><br>
That shows the comet as it <mark4>whisks</mark4><br>
Its tail across the planets' <mark3>disks,</mark3><br>
As if to blind their blood-shot <mark1>eyes;</mark1><br>
Or wheels so close against the <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
We tremble at the thought of <mark3>risks</mark3><br>
Our little spinning ball may <mark3>run,</mark3><br>
To pop like corn that children <mark3>parch,</mark3><br>
From summer something <mark3>overdone,</mark3><br>
And roll, a cinder, through the <mark1>skies.</mark1><br>
<br>
Grudge not to-day the scanty <mark3>fee</mark3><br>
To him who farms the <mark5>firmament,</mark5><br>
To whom the Milky Way is <mark3>free;</mark3><br>
Who holds the wondrous crystal <mark3>key,</mark3><br>
The silent Open <mark4>Sesame</mark4><br>
That Science to her sons has <mark4>lent;</mark4><br>
Who takes his toll, and lifts the <mark4>bar</mark4><br>
That shuts the road to sun and <mark3>star.</mark3><br>
If Venus only comes to <mark3>time,</mark3><br>
(And prophets say she must and <mark5>shall,)</mark5><br>
To-day will hear the tinkling <mark3>chime</mark3><br>
Of many a ringing silver <mark3>dime,</mark3><br>
For him whose optic glass <mark3>supplies</mark3><br>
The crowd with astronomic <mark1>eyes,--</mark1><br>
The Galileo of the <mark4>Mall.</mark4><br>
<br>
Dimly the transit morning <mark3>broke;</mark3><br>
The sun seemed doubting what to <mark3>do,</mark3><br>
As one who questions how to <mark4>dress,</mark4><br>
And takes his doublets from the <mark3>press,</mark3><br>
And halts between the old and <mark3>new.</mark3><br>
Please Heaven he wear his suit of <mark3>blue,</mark3><br>
Or don, at least, his ragged <mark3>cloak,</mark3><br>
With rents that show the azure <mark3>through!</mark3><br>
<br>
I go the patient crowd to <mark4>join</mark4><br>
That round the tube my eyes <mark4>discern,</mark4><br>
The last new-comer of the <mark4>file,</mark4><br>
And wait, and wait, a weary <mark3>while,</mark3><br>
And gape, and stretch, and shrug, and <mark3>smile,</mark3><br>
(For each his place must fairly <mark3>earn,</mark3><br>
Hindmost and foremost, in his <mark3>turn,)</mark3><br>
Till hitching onward, pace by <mark4>pace,</mark4><br>
I gain at last the envied <mark3>place,</mark3><br>
And pay the white exiguous <mark4>coin:</mark4><br>
The sun and I are face to <mark3>face;</mark3><br>
He glares at me, I stare at <mark4>him;</mark4><br>
And lo! my straining eye has <mark3>found</mark3><br>
A little spot that, black and <mark3>round,</mark3><br>
Lies near the crimsoned fire-orb's <mark3>rim.</mark3><br>
O blessed, beauteous evening <mark1>star,</mark1><br>
Well named for her whom earth <mark4>adores,--</mark4><br>
The Lady of the dove-drawn <mark3>car,--</mark3><br>
I know thee in thy white simar; <br>
But veiled in black, a rayless <mark4>spot,</mark4><br>
Blank as a careless scribbler's <mark3>blot,</mark3><br>
Stripped of thy robe of silvery <mark4>flame,--</mark4><br>
The stolen robe that Night <mark3>restores</mark3><br>
When Day has shut his golden <mark3>doors,--</mark3><br>
I see thee, yet I know thee <mark3>not;</mark3><br>
And canst thou call thyself the <mark3>same?</mark3><br>
<br>
A black, round spot,--and that is <mark4>all;</mark4><br>
And such a speck our earth would <mark4>be</mark4><br>
If he who looks upon the <mark4>stars</mark4><br>
Through the red atmosphere of <mark3>Mars</mark3><br>
Could see our little creeping <mark3>ball</mark3><br>
Across the disk of crimson <mark3>crawl</mark3><br>
As I our sister planet <mark3>see.</mark3><br>
<br>
And art thou, then, a world like <mark3>ours,</mark3><br>
Flung from the orb that whirled our <mark4>own</mark4><br>
A molten pebble from its <mark3>zone?</mark3><br>
How must thy burning sands <mark3>absorb</mark3><br>
The fire-waves of the blazing <mark3>orb,</mark3><br>
Thy chain so short, thy path so <mark4>near,</mark4><br>
Thy flame-defying creatures <mark4>hear</mark4><br>
The maelstroms of the photosphere! <br>
And is thy bosom decked with <mark3>flowers</mark3><br>
That steal their bloom from scalding <mark3>showers?</mark3><br>
And hast thou cities, <mark4>domes</mark4>, and <mark3>towers,</mark3><br>
And life, and love that makes it <mark4>dear,</mark4><br>
And death that fills thy tribes with <mark3>fear?</mark3><br>
<br>
Lost in my dream, my spirit <mark4>soars</mark4><br>
Through paths the wandering angels <mark3>know;</mark3><br>
My all-pervading thought <mark3>explores</mark3><br>
The azure ocean's lucent <mark3>shores;</mark3><br>
I leave my mortal self <mark1>below,</mark1><br>
As up the star-lit stairs I <mark4>climb,</mark4><br>
And still the widening view <mark4>reveals</mark4><br>
In endless rounds the circling <mark3>wheels</mark3><br>
That build the horologe of <mark1>time.</mark1><br>
New spheres, new suns, new systems <mark4>gleam;</mark4><br>
The voice no earth-born echo <mark4>hears</mark4><br>
Steals softly on my ravished <mark3>ears:</mark3><br>
I hear them "singing as they <mark1>shine"--</mark1><br>
A mortal's voice dissolves my <mark3>dream:</mark3><br>
My patient neighbor, next in <mark1>line,</mark1><br>
Hints gently there are those who <mark4>wait.</mark4><br>
O guardian of the starry <mark3>gate,</mark3><br>
What coin shall pay this debt of <mark3>mine?</mark3><br>
Too slight thy claim, too small the <mark1>fee</mark1><br>
That bids thee turn the potent <mark1>key</mark1><br>
The Tuscan's hand has placed in <mark3>thine.</mark3><br>
Forgive my own the small <mark4>affront,</mark4><br>
The insult of the proffered <mark1>dime;</mark1><br>
Take it, O friend, since this thy <mark4>wont,</mark4><br>
But still shall faithful memory <mark1>be</mark1><br>
A bankrupt debtor unto <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
And pay thee with a grateful <mark3>rhyme.</mark3><br>
