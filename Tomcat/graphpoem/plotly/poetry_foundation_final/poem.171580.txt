Title : The Delicacy <br>
Author : Sandra McPherson <br><br>

Friend, remember how you showed us beasts love <mark4>beauty?</mark4><br>
We were wading in your lake with bluegills and you said,   <br>
Be careful, you will lose your beauty <mark4>marks</mark4><br>
<br>
To their little jaws. We were a delicacy. From us they <mark4>purchased</mark4><br>
The darkest part of the skin, only what contrasts on <mark4>us.</mark4><br>
And it was more than a pinch or sting, <br>
<br>
It's a sensation of hunger <br>
That makes us spring off the bottom and swim out deep   <br>
And safe. "No blue stripes on cheeks; no red on fins; <br>
<br>
Old individual's belly coppery red or <mark4>brassy."</mark4><br>
As others see you, I think these <mark4>indicate,</mark4><br>
Who would have you all one shade then wouldn't have you. <br>
<br>
At your full table later, over muskellunge and lemon,   <br>
We read in the book the fish that liked <mark1>us</mark1><br>
Has certain maxillaries "wholly wanting." Your gourmet bluegill: <br>
<br>
It lives in the eye of the beholder, it swims the <mark4>vitreous</mark4><br>
Humor, would eat even your blind <mark4>spot!</mark4><br>
But we think we can paddle out there until all <br>
<br>
Goes dark, and we are wholly desirable, and too <mark4>much.</mark4><br>
