Title : Elegy in an Abandoned Boatyard <br>
Author : Dave Smith <br><br>

... mindful of the unhonored dead --Thomas <mark3>Gray</mark3><br>
Here they <mark4>stood</mark4>, whom the Kecoughtan first <mark4>believed</mark4><br>
gods from another world, one pair of longjohns <br>
each, bad-yellow, knotted with <mark4>lice,</mark4><br>
the godless, bandy-legged runts   <br>
with ear bit off, or eye <mark4>gouged,</mark4><br>
who killed and <mark4>prayed</mark4><br>
over whatever flew, squatted, or <mark4>swam.</mark4><br>
<br>
In huts hacked from mulberry, pine, and swamp <mark4>cyprus,</mark4><br>
they huddled ripe as <mark4>hounds.</mark4><br>
At cockcrow scratched, shuffled marsh <mark4>paths,</mark4><br>
took skiffs and ferried to dead-rise scows,   <br>
twenty-footers dutifully designed and of right <mark4>draft</mark4><br>
for oysters, crabs, and croakers. <br>
They were <mark4>seaworthy.</mark4><br>
<br>
According to diaries hand-scrawled, and terse court <mark4>records,</mark4><br>
our ancestors: barbarous, habitual, <mark4>Virginians.</mark4><br>
<br>
Some would not sail, came ashore, walked on the <mark4>land,</mark4><br>
kept faces clenched, lay seed and <mark4>family,</mark4><br>
moved often, and are gone. Of <mark4>them</mark4><br>
this harbor says <mark4>nothing.</mark4><br>
Of the sea's workmen, not <mark1>much,</mark1><br>
no brass plate of honor, no monument in the <mark3>square,</mark3><br>
no square, merely the wreckage of a <mark4>place.</mark4><br>
<br>
But they <mark4>stood--</mark4><br>
proud, black and <mark4>white</mark4>, surly in <mark4>mist</mark4><br>
at the hovel of the boatwright, arm <mark4>pointed:</mark4><br>
Build me one like that <mark1>yonder!</mark1><br>
Meaning the gray hull I see across a <mark4>cove,</mark4><br>
bottom up, canting, nameless now as the <mark4>hard,</mark4><br>
long arm, daddy's or granddaddy's, that points, <mark4>but</mark4><br>
known to the one said to crush clams in his palms, <mark4>thus</mark4><br>
got paid, always, who built the derelicts, and <mark3>who,</mark3><br>
barring feud, took stick in hand here, <mark4>made</mark4><br>
that grave gouged line of a <mark4>keel,</mark4><br>
<br>
then his broad <mark3>brow</mark3><br>
<br>
lifted seaward, in silence, <mark4>sometimes</mark4><br>
summoning a shape in memory, and it hove up, and <mark4>was</mark4><br>
changed some, they whined, but God <mark4>knows</mark4><br>
all they wanted, all he made for them <mark1>was</mark1><br>
to be a little unlike the drab <mark4>hulls</mark4><br>
of the dead ones, but not too <mark1>much.</mark1><br>
Like that one <mark1>yonder!</mark1><br>
<br>
This was the image he gave them to dream of <mark1>change,</mark1><br>
tomorrow only a guess, the sea's story <mark3>their</mark3><br>
life-stink and bow-slam and stillness, and <mark3>they</mark3><br>
saw how the fair ones grew, quick <mark4>riddle-riders</mark4><br>
our fathers feared, schools that gave <mark3>us</mark3><br>
a message sewn on chest, Bible, <mark4>slate,</mark4><br>
and this worm-holed future <mark4>entered</mark4><br>
<br>
blindly as I now have entered his place, <mark4>feeling</mark4><br>
for log-char, back-flung gates of <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
and the <mark4>builder.</mark4><br>
Like that one <mark4>...</mark4><br>
the lies begin, each inventing <mark3>why</mark3><br>
he should rise up, he should hack <mark4>out</mark4><br>
the joy they dream, his pitch boiled, <mark4>black</mark4><br>
as mud seaming their <mark4>legs.</mark4><br>
<br>
                                       Suddenly, I see <br>
and take up a cap left as worthless on a stump, <mark4>its</mark4><br>
stained round fitting my head like <mark4>water.</mark4><br>
<br>
Merely to wait where the builder heaved shards and <mark4>chips</mark4><br>
and abortive clots to the tide's <mark4>tongue-lap</mark4><br>
is to feel the unconceived shape <mark4>pulse</mark4><br>
down his arm, into <mark4>fingers</mark4><br>
that took up that stick to let <mark4>loose</mark4><br>
the ingathered <mark4>wilderness</mark4><br>
of dreams: loon, crow, osprey, gull, the <mark4>man</mark4><br>
who cannot believe what he sees, but still sees <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
<br>
An immense <mark5>shadow</mark5><br>
making over <mark1>water.</mark1><br>
<br>
Stick in hand, eyes squint. <mark4>And</mark4><br>
<br>
there it <mark4>is,</mark4><br>
the wind <mark4>cradling</mark4><br>
<br>
of an Eagle, wing-sails, unfurled, <mark4>bow-chopping</mark4><br>
white water head on, a creature now there, now <mark4>gone.</mark4><br>
A man, I have to hold my face up, study <mark3>how</mark3><br>
air heats, builds a rising push until the <mark3>high</mark3><br>
circle of sight skids out <mark4>everywhere.</mark4><br>
Dreaming <mark1>change,</mark1><br>
<br>
I understand, <mark4>almost</mark4>, the problem: is he not <mark4>harnessed,</mark4><br>
<br>
himself, this light <mark4>flyer</mark4>, this <mark4>father</mark4><br>
designed to sail like a small god, to <mark4>screech</mark4><br>
down upon pine-huddled, hungry chicks he <mark4>must</mark4><br>
send off with his lethal, air-buoyed <mark4>shape?</mark4><br>
Nothing in him asks what <mark1>is</mark1><br>
over the <mark4>wave-edge</mark4><br>
where our brothers float and <mark4>sink,</mark4><br>
lovely <mark4>shadows</mark4>, by the <mark4>millions.</mark4><br>
Putting my back to the sea-worn <mark4>trunk</mark4><br>
they have left me, I pull the stick <mark3>through</mark3><br>
the dirt, and remember the long <mark4>line,</mark4><br>
man-weight in it, and <mark4>dark-buoyed.</mark4><br>
It <mark4>grows</mark4><br>
<br>
with freckling light, with the answering of <mark4>birds</mark4><br>
crying out the only speech we all <mark4>have</mark4><br>
above our unfinished <mark4>country</mark4><br>
that looms still in the <mark4>soul,</mark4><br>
that would bear us <mark4>hence,</mark4><br>
out of the water that beats <mark4>in,</mark4><br>
out of the water that bore us all <mark4>here.</mark4><br>
