Title : The Blue Scarf <br>
Author : Amy Lowell <br><br>

Pale, with the blue of high zeniths, shimmered over with silver, brocaded <br>
In smooth, running patterns, a soft stuff, with dark knotted fringes, it lies there, <br>
Warm from a woman's soft shoulders, and my fingers close on it, <mark4>caressing.</mark4><br>
Where is <mark3>she</mark3>, the woman who wore it? The scent of her lingers and drugs <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
A languor, fire-shotted, runs through me, and I crush the scarf down on my face, <br>
And gulp in the warmth and the blueness, and my eyes swim in cool-tinted <mark4>heavens.</mark4><br>
Around me are columns of marble, and a diapered, sun-flickered pavement. <br>
Rose-leaves blow and patter against it. Below the stone steps a lute tinkles. <br>
A jar of green jade throws its shadow half over the floor. A big-bellied <br>
Frog hops through the sunlight, and plops in the gold-bubbled water of a <mark4>basin,</mark4><br>
Sunk in the black and white marble. The west wind has lifted a scarf <br>
On the seat close beside me; the blue of it is a violent outrage of colour. <br>
She draws it more closely about her, and it ripples beneath her slight <mark4>stirring.</mark4><br>
Her kisses are sharp buds of fire; and I burn back against her, a jewel <br>
Hard and white, a stalked, flaming flower; till I break to a handful of <mark4>cinders,</mark4><br>
And open my eyes to the scarf, shining blue in the afternoon <mark4>sunshine.</mark4><br>
<br>
How loud clocks can tick when a room is empty, and one is <mark4>alone!</mark4><br>
