Title : The Book of Thel <br>
Author : William Blake <br><br>

THEL'S MOTTO Does the Eagle know what is in the pit? Or wilt thou go ask the Mole? Can Wisdom be put in a silver rod? Or Love in a golden <mark4>bowl?</mark4><br>
<br>
The daughters of Mne Seraphim led round their sunny <mark4>flocks,</mark4><br>
All but the youngest; she in paleness sought the secret <mark1>air,</mark1><br>
To fade away like morning beauty from her mortal <mark3>day;</mark3><br>
Down by the river of Adona her soft voice is <mark4>heard,</mark4><br>
And thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew: <br>
<br>
"O life of this our spring! why fades the lotus of the <mark1>water?</mark1><br>
Why fade these children of the spring, born but to smile & <mark4>fall?</mark4><br>
Ah! Thel is like a watry bow, and like a parting <mark4>cloud,</mark4><br>
Like a reflection in a glass, like shadows in the <mark1>water,</mark1><br>
Like dreams of <mark4>infants</mark4>, like a smile upon an infant's <mark4>face,</mark4><br>
Like the dove's voice, like transient day, like music in the <mark1>air.</mark1><br>
Ah! gentle may I lay me down, and gentle rest my <mark4>head,</mark4><br>
And gentle sleep the sleep of death, and gentle hear the <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
Of him that walketh in the garden in the evening <mark4>time."</mark4><br>
<br>
The Lily of the valley, breathing in the humble <mark4>grass</mark4><br>
Answer'd the lovely maid and said: "I am a watry <mark4>weed,</mark4><br>
And I am very small, and love to dwell in lowly <mark4>vales;</mark4><br>
So weak, the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my <mark1>head;</mark1><br>
Yet I am visited from heaven, and he that smiles on <mark3>all</mark3><br>
Walks in the valley and each morn over me spreads his <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
Saying: 'Rejoice, thou humble grass, thou new-born lily <mark4>flower,</mark4><br>
Thou gentle maid of silent valleys and of modest <mark4>brooks;</mark4><br>
For thou shalt be clothed in light, and fed with morning manna, <br>
Till summer's heat melts thee beside the fountains and the <mark4>springs</mark4><br>
To flourish in eternal vales.' Then why should Thel <mark4>complain?</mark4><br>
<br>
Why should the mistress of the vales of Har utter a <mark3>sigh?"</mark3><br>
<br>
She ceasd and smild in tears, then sat down in her silver <mark4>shrine.</mark4><br>
<br>
Thel answered: "O thou little virgin of the peaceful <mark5>valley,</mark5><br>
Giving to those that cannot crave, the voiceless, the <mark4>o'ertired;</mark4><br>
Thy breath doth nourish the innocent lamb, he smells thy milky <mark4>garments,</mark4><br>
He crops thy flowers, while thou sittest smiling in his <mark1>face,</mark1><br>
Wiping his mild and meekin mouth from all contagious <mark4>taints.</mark4><br>
Thy wine doth purify the golden honey; thy <mark4>perfume,</mark4><br>
Which thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that <mark1>springs,</mark1><br>
Revives the milked cow, & tames the fire-breathing <mark4>steed.</mark4><br>
But Thel is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising <mark4>sun:</mark4><br>
I vanish from my pearly throne, and who shall find my <mark4>place?"</mark4><br>
<br>
"Queen of the vales," the Lily <mark4>answered</mark4>, "ask the tender <mark1>cloud,</mark1><br>
And it shall tell thee why it glitters in the morning <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
And why it scatters its bright beauty thro' the humid <mark1>air.</mark1><br>
Descend, O little cloud, & hover before the eyes of <mark5>Thel."</mark5><br>
<br>
The Cloud <mark4>descended</mark4>, and the Lily bowd her modest <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
And went to mind her numerous charge among the verdant <mark1>grass.</mark1><br>
<br>
"O little Cloud," the virgin said, "I charge thee tell to <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
Why thou complainest not when in one hour thou fade <mark3>away:</mark3><br>
Then we shall seek thee but not find; ah, Thel is like to <mark3>Thee.</mark3><br>
I pass away, yet I complain, and no one hears my <mark1>voice."</mark1><br>
The Cloud then shew'd his golden head & his bright form emerg'd, <br>
<br>
Hovering and glittering on the air before the face of <mark1>Thel.</mark1><br>
"O virgin, know'st thou not our steeds drink of the golden <mark1>springs</mark1><br>
<br>
Where Luvah doth renew his horses? Look'st thou on my youth, <br>
And fearest thou because I vanish and am seen no <mark4>more,</mark4><br>
Nothing remains? O maid, I tell thee, when I pass <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
It is to tenfold life, to love, to peace, and raptures <mark4>holy:</mark4><br>
Unseen descending, weigh my light wings upon balmy <mark4>flowers,</mark4><br>
And court the fair eyed dew, to take me to her shining <mark4>tent:</mark4><br>
The weeping virgin trembling kneels before the risen <mark1>sun,</mark1><br>
Till we arise link'd in a golden band, and never <mark4>part,</mark4><br>
But walk united, bearing food to all our tender <mark1>flowers."</mark1><br>
"Dost thou O little Cloud? I fear that I am not like <mark1>thee;</mark1><br>
<br>
For I walk through the vales of Har and smell the sweetest <mark1>flowers,</mark1><br>
But I feed not the little <mark4>flowers</mark4>, I hear the warbling <mark4>birds,</mark4><br>
But I feed not the warbling birds; they fly and seek their <mark4>food;</mark4><br>
But Thel delights in these no more, because I fade <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
And all shall say, 'Without a use this shining woman <mark4>liv'd,</mark4><br>
Or did she only live to be at death the food of <mark4>worms?'"</mark4><br>
The Cloud reclind upon his airy throne and answer'd <mark4>thus:</mark4><br>
<br>
"Then if thou art the food of <mark4>worms</mark4>, O virgin of the <mark4>skies,</mark4><br>
<br>
How great thy <mark4>use</mark4>, how great thy blessing! Every thing that <mark4>lives</mark4><br>
Lives not alone, nor for itself; fear not, and I will <mark3>call</mark3><br>
The weak worm from its lowly bed, and thou shalt hear its <mark1>voice.</mark1><br>
Come forth, worm of the silent valley, to thy pensive <mark4>queen."</mark4><br>
The helpless worm arose, and sat upon the Lily's <mark1>leaf,</mark1><br>
<br>
And the bright Cloud saild on, to find his partner in the <mark4>vale.</mark4><br>
Then Thel astonish'd view'd the Worm upon its dewy <mark4>bed.</mark4><br>
<br>
"Art thou a Worm? Image of weakness, art thou but a <mark4>Worm?</mark4><br>
I see thee like an infant wrapped in the Lily's <mark1>leaf;</mark1><br>
<br>
Ah, weep not, little voice, thou can'st not speak, but thou can'st <mark5>weep.</mark5><br>
Is this a Worm? I see thee lay helpless & naked, <mark5>weeping,</mark5><br>
And none to answer, none to cherish thee with mother's <mark4>smiles."</mark4><br>
The Clod of Clay heard the Worm's voice, & raisd her pitying <mark1>head;</mark1><br>
She bow'd over the weeping infant, and her life exhal'd <br>
<br>
In milky fondness; then on Thel she fix'd her humble <mark4>eyes.</mark4><br>
"O beauty of the vales of Har! we live not for <mark4>ourselves;</mark4><br>
Thou seest me the meanest thing, and so I am <mark4>indeed;</mark4><br>
<br>
My bosom of itself is cold, and of itself is <mark4>dark,</mark4><br>
But he that loves the lowly, pours his oil upon my <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
And kisses me, and binds his nuptial bands around my <mark4>breast,</mark4><br>
<br>
And says: 'Thou mother of my children, I have loved <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
And I have given thee a crown that none can take <mark1>away.'</mark1><br>
But how this is, sweet maid, I know not, and I cannot know; <br>
I ponder, and I cannot ponder; yet I live and <mark4>love."</mark4><br>
The daughter of beauty wip'd her pitying tears with her white <mark2>veil,</mark2><br>
And said: "Alas! I knew not this, and therefore did I <mark1>weep.</mark1><br>
<br>
That God would love a Worm, I knew, and punish the evil <mark4>foot</mark4><br>
That, wilful, bruis'd its helpless form; but that he cherish'd <mark4>it</mark4><br>
With milk and oil I never knew; and therefore did I <mark1>weep,</mark1><br>
And I complaind in the mild air, because I fade <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
And lay me down in thy cold bed, and leave my shining <mark4>lot."</mark4><br>
"Queen of the vales," the matron Clay answered, "I heard thy <mark4>sighs,</mark4><br>
And all thy moans flew o'er my roof, but I have call'd them <mark4>down.</mark4><br>
<br>
Wilt thou, O Queen, enter my house? 'tis given thee to <mark4>enter</mark4><br>
And to return: fear nothing, enter with thy virgin <mark4>feet."</mark4><br>
The eternal gates' terrific porter lifted the northern <mark4>bar:</mark4><br>
Thel enter'd in & saw the secrets of the land <mark4>unknown.</mark4><br>
<br>
She saw the couches of the dead, & where the fibrous <mark4>roots</mark4><br>
Of every heart on earth infixes deep its restless <mark4>twists:</mark4><br>
A land of sorrows & of tears where never smile was <mark4>seen.</mark4><br>
She wanderd in the land of clouds thro' valleys dark, listning <br>
Dolours & lamentations; waiting oft beside a dewy <mark4>grave,</mark4><br>
She stood in silence, listning to the voices of the <mark4>ground,</mark4><br>
<br>
Till to her own grave plot she came, & there she sat <mark1>down,</mark1><br>
And heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow <mark4>pit:</mark4><br>
"Why cannot the Ear be closed to its own <mark4>destruction?</mark4><br>
Or the glistning Eye to the poison of a <mark4>smile?</mark4><br>
Why are Eyelids stord with arrows ready <mark4>drawn,</mark4><br>
<br>
Where a thousand fighting men in ambush <mark3>lie?</mark3><br>
Or an Eye of gifts & graces, show'ring fruits and coined <mark4>gold?</mark4><br>
Why a Tongue impress'd with honey from every <mark4>wind?</mark4><br>
Why an Ear, a whirlpool fierce to draw creations <mark4>in?</mark4><br>
Why a Nostril wide inhaling terror, trembling, and affright? <br>
Why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy? <br>
Why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our <mark4>desire?"</mark4><br>
The Virgin started from her seat, & with a <mark4>shriek</mark4><br>
Fled back unhinderd till she came into the vales of <mark3>Har.</mark3><br>
