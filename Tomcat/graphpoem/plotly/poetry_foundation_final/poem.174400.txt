Title : Mutability ["The flower that smiles to-day"] <br>
Author : Percy Bysshe Shelley <br><br>

The flower that smiles <mark3>to-day</mark3><br>
To-morrow <mark3>dies;</mark3><br>
All that we wish to <mark3>stay</mark3><br>
Tempts and then <mark3>flies.</mark3><br>
What is this world's <mark3>delight?</mark3><br>
Lightning that mocks the <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
Brief even as <mark3>bright.</mark3><br>
<br>
Virtue, how frail it <mark4>is!</mark4><br>
Friendship how <mark3>rare!</mark3><br>
Love, how it sells poor bliss <br>
For proud <mark3>despair!</mark3><br>
But we, though soon they <mark3>fall,</mark3><br>
Survive their joy, and <mark3>all</mark3><br>
Which ours we <mark3>call.</mark3><br>
<br>
Whilst skies are blue and <mark1>bright,</mark1><br>
Whilst flowers are <mark3>gay,</mark3><br>
Whilst eyes that change ere <mark1>night</mark1><br>
Make glad the <mark3>day;</mark3><br>
Whilst yet the calm hours <mark3>creep,</mark3><br>
Dream thou--and from thy <mark3>sleep</mark3><br>
Then wake to <mark3>weep.</mark3><br>
