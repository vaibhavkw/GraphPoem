Title : An Epitaph on S.P. <br>
Author : Ben Jonson <br><br>

A Child of Queen Elizabeth's <mark4>Chapel</mark4><br>
Weep with me, all you that <mark3>read</mark3><br>
This little <mark4>story:</mark4><br>
And know, for whom a tear you <mark3>shed</mark3><br>
Death's self is <mark4>sorry.</mark4><br>
'Twas a child, that so did <mark3>thrive</mark3><br>
In grace and <mark3>feature,</mark3><br>
As heaven and nature seem'd to <mark3>strive</mark3><br>
Which own'd the <mark3>creature.</mark3><br>
Years he number'd scarce <mark4>thirteen</mark4><br>
When fates turn'd <mark4>cruel,</mark4><br>
Yet three fill'd zodiacs had he <mark4>been</mark4><br>
The stage's <mark3>jewel;</mark3><br>
And did act (what now we <mark4>moan)</mark4><br>
Old men so <mark4>duly,</mark4><br>
As, sooth, the Parcae thought him <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
He play'd so <mark3>truly.</mark3><br>
So, by error, to his <mark3>fate</mark3><br>
They all <mark4>consented;</mark4><br>
But viewing him since (alas, too <mark3>late)</mark3><br>
They have <mark3>repented;</mark3><br>
And have sought (to give new <mark3>birth)</mark3><br>
In baths to steep <mark1>him;</mark1><br>
But being so much too good for <mark3>earth,</mark3><br>
Heaven vows to keep <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
