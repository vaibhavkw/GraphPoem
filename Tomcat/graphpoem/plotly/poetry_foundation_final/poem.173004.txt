Title : Caliban upon Setebos <br>
Author : Robert Browning <br><br>

"Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as <mark4>thyself."</mark4><br>
(David, Psalms 50.21)<br>
['Will sprawl, now that the heat of day is <mark4>best,</mark4><br>
Flat on his belly in the pit's much <mark4>mire,</mark4><br>
With elbows wide, fists clenched to prop his <mark4>chin.</mark4><br>
And, while he kicks both feet in the cool <mark4>slush,</mark4><br>
And feels about his spine small eft-things <mark4>course,</mark4><br>
Run in and out each arm, and make him <mark4>laugh:</mark4><br>
And while above his head a <mark4>pompion-plant,</mark4><br>
Coating the cave-top as a brow its <mark1>eye,</mark1><br>
Creeps down to touch and tickle hair and <mark4>beard,</mark4><br>
And now a flower drops with a bee <mark4>inside,</mark4><br>
And now a fruit to snap at, catch and <mark4>crunch,?</mark4><br>
He looks out o'er yon sea which sunbeams <mark4>cross</mark4><br>
And recross till they weave a <mark4>spider-web</mark4><br>
(Meshes of fire, some great fish breaks at <mark4>times)</mark4><br>
And talks to his own self, howe'er he <mark4>please,</mark4><br>
Touching that other, whom his dam called <mark4>God.</mark4><br>
Because to talk about Him, <mark5>vexes?ha,</mark5><br>
Could He but know! and time to vex is <mark1>now,</mark1><br>
When talk is safer than in <mark4>winter-time.</mark4><br>
Moreover Prosper and Miranda <mark3>sleep</mark3><br>
In confidence he drudges at their <mark4>task,</mark4><br>
And it is good to cheat the pair, and <mark4>gibe,</mark4><br>
Letting the rank tongue blossom into <mark4>speech.]</mark4><br>
<br>
<mark1>Setebos</mark1>, Setebos, and <mark1>Setebos!</mark1><br>
'Thinketh, He dwelleth i' the cold o' the <mark4>moon.</mark4><br>
<br>
'Thinketh He made it, with the sun to <mark4>match,</mark4><br>
But not the <mark4>stars</mark4>, the stars came <mark4>otherwise;</mark4><br>
Only made clouds, winds, meteors, such as <mark4>that:</mark4><br>
Also this isle, what lives and grows <mark4>thereon,</mark4><br>
And snaky sea which rounds and ends the <mark4>same.</mark4><br>
<br>
'Thinketh, it came of being ill at <mark4>ease:</mark4><br>
He hated that He cannot change His <mark4>cold,</mark4><br>
Nor cure its ache. 'Hath spied an icy <mark4>fish</mark4><br>
That longed to 'scape the rock-stream where she <mark4>lived,</mark4><br>
And thaw herself within the lukewarm <mark4>brine</mark4><br>
O' the lazy sea her stream thrusts far <mark4>amid,</mark4><br>
A crystal spike 'twixt two warm walls of <mark4>wave;</mark4><br>
Only, she ever sickened, found <mark4>repulse</mark4><br>
At the other kind of water, not her <mark4>life,</mark4><br>
(Green-dense and dim-delicious, bred o' the <mark4>sun)</mark4><br>
Flounced back from bliss she was not born to breathe,<br>
And in her old bounds buried her <mark4>despair,</mark4><br>
Hating and loving warmth alike: so <mark3>He.</mark3><br>
<br>
'Thinketh, He made thereat the sun, this <mark3>isle,</mark3><br>
Trees and the fowls here, beast and creeping <mark4>thing.</mark4><br>
Yon otter, sleek-wet, black, lithe as a <mark4>leech;</mark4><br>
Yon auk, one fire-eye in a ball of <mark4>foam,</mark4><br>
That floats and feeds; a certain badger <mark4>brown</mark4><br>
He hath watched hunt with that slant white-wedge <mark1>eye</mark1><br>
By moonlight; and the pie with the long <mark4>tongue</mark4><br>
That pricks deep into oak warts for a <mark4>worm,</mark4><br>
And says a plain word when she finds her <mark4>prize,</mark4><br>
But will not eat the ants; the ants <mark4>themselves</mark4><br>
That build a wall of seeds and settled <mark4>stalks</mark4><br>
About their hole?He made all these and <mark4>more,</mark4><br>
Made all we see, and <mark4>us</mark4>, in spite: how <mark4>else?</mark4><br>
He could not, <mark3>Himself</mark3>, make a second <mark4>self</mark4><br>
To be His mate; as well have made <mark3>Himself:</mark3><br>
He would not make what He mislikes or <mark4>slights,</mark4><br>
An eyesore to Him, or not worth His <mark4>pains:</mark4><br>
But did, in envy, listlessness or <mark4>sport,</mark4><br>
Make what Himself would fain, in a manner, <mark3>be?</mark3><br>
Weaker in most points, stronger in a <mark3>few,</mark3><br>
Worthy, and yet mere playthings all the <mark3>while,</mark3><br>
Things He admires and mocks too,?that is <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
Because, so brave, so better though they <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
It nothing skills if He begin to <mark4>plague.</mark4><br>
Look, now, I melt a gourd-fruit into <mark4>mash,</mark4><br>
Add honeycomb and pods, I have <mark4>perceived,</mark4><br>
Which bite like finches when they bill and <mark4>kiss,?</mark4><br>
Then, when froth rises bladdery, drink up <mark4>all,</mark4><br>
Quick, quick, till maggots scamper through my <mark4>brain;</mark4><br>
Last, throw me on my back i' the seeded <mark4>thyme,</mark4><br>
And wanton, wishing I were born a <mark4>bird.</mark4><br>
Put case, unable to be what I <mark4>wish,</mark4><br>
I yet could make a live bird out of <mark1>clay:</mark1><br>
Would not I take clay, pinch my <mark1>Caliban</mark1><br>
Able to fly??for, there, see, he hath <mark4>wings,</mark4><br>
And great comb like the hoopoe's to <mark4>admire,</mark4><br>
And there, a sting to do his foes <mark5>offence,</mark5><br>
There, and I will that he begin to <mark4>live,</mark4><br>
Fly to yon rock-top, nip me off the <mark4>horns</mark4><br>
Of grigs high up that make the merry <mark4>din,</mark4><br>
Saucy through their veined wings, and mind me <mark4>not.</mark4><br>
In which feat, if his leg snapped, brittle <mark1>clay,</mark1><br>
And he lay stupid-like,?why, I should <mark1>laugh;</mark1><br>
And if he, spying me, should fall to <mark3>weep,</mark3><br>
Beseech me to be good, repair his <mark4>wrong,</mark4><br>
Bid his poor leg smart less or grow <mark4>again,?</mark4><br>
Well, as the chance were, this might take or <mark1>else</mark1><br>
Not take my fancy: I might hear his <mark3>cry,</mark3><br>
And give the mankin three sound legs for <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
Or pluck the other off, leave him like an <mark4>egg</mark4><br>
And lessoned he was mine and merely <mark1>clay.</mark1><br>
Were this no pleasure, lying in the <mark1>thyme,</mark1><br>
Drinking the mash, with brain become <mark3>alive,</mark3><br>
Making and marring clay at will? So <mark1>He.</mark1><br>
<br>
'Thinketh, such shows nor right nor wrong in <mark4>Him,</mark4><br>
Nor <mark4>kind</mark4>, nor cruel: He is strong and <mark4>Lord.</mark4><br>
'Am strong myself compared to yonder <mark4>crabs</mark4><br>
That march now from the mountain to the <mark3>sea;</mark3><br>
'Let twenty pass, and stone the <mark4>twenty-first,</mark4><br>
Loving not, hating not, just choosing <mark1>so.</mark1><br>
'Say, the first straggler that boasts purple <mark4>spots</mark4><br>
Shall join the file, one pincer twisted <mark4>off;</mark4><br>
'Say, this bruised fellow shall receive a <mark1>worm,</mark1><br>
And two worms he whose nippers end in <mark4>red;</mark4><br>
As it likes me each time, I do: so <mark1>He.</mark1><br>
<br>
Well <mark4>then</mark4>, 'supposeth He is good i' the <mark4>main,</mark4><br>
Placable if His mind and ways were <mark4>guessed,</mark4><br>
But rougher than His handiwork, be <mark4>sure!</mark4><br>
Oh, He hath made things worthier than <mark1>Himself,</mark1><br>
And envieth that, so helped, such things do <mark1>more</mark1><br>
Than He who made them! What consoles but <mark4>this?</mark4><br>
That they, unless through Him, do nought at <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
And must submit: what other use in <mark4>things?</mark4><br>
'Hath cut a pipe of pithless <mark4>elder-joint</mark4><br>
That, blown through, gives exact the scream o' the <mark3>jay</mark3><br>
When from her wing you twitch the feathers <mark3>blue:</mark3><br>
Sound this, and little birds that hate the <mark1>jay</mark1><br>
Flock within stone's throw, glad their foe is <mark4>hurt:</mark4><br>
Put case such pipe could prattle and boast <mark5>forsooth</mark5><br>
"I catch the birds, I am the crafty <mark1>thing,</mark1><br>
I make the cry my maker cannot <mark4>make</mark4><br>
With his great round mouth; he must blow through <mark4>mine!'</mark4><br>
Would not I smash it with my foot? So <mark1>He.</mark1><br>
<br>
But wherefore rough, why cold and ill at <mark1>ease?</mark1><br>
Aha, that is a question! Ask, for <mark1>that,</mark1><br>
What knows,?the something over <mark1>Setebos</mark1><br>
That made Him, or He, may be, found and <mark4>fought,</mark4><br>
Worsted, drove off and did to nothing, <mark4>perchance.</mark4><br>
There may be something quiet o'er His <mark3>head,</mark3><br>
Out of His reach, that feels nor joy nor <mark4>grief,</mark4><br>
Since both derive from weakness in some <mark3>way.</mark3><br>
I joy because the quails come; would not joy<br>
Could I bring quails here when I have a <mark4>mind:</mark4><br>
This Quiet, all it hath a mind to, <mark4>doth.</mark4><br>
'Esteemeth stars the outposts of its <mark4>couch,</mark4><br>
But never spends much thought nor care that <mark1>way.</mark1><br>
It may look up, work up,?the worse for <mark4>those</mark4><br>
It works on! 'Careth but for <mark1>Setebos</mark1><br>
The many-handed as a <mark4>cuttle-fish,</mark4><br>
Who, making Himself feared through what He <mark4>does,</mark4><br>
Looks up, first, and perceives he cannot <mark3>soar</mark3><br>
To what is quiet and hath happy <mark1>life;</mark1><br>
Next looks down here, and out of very <mark4>spite</mark4><br>
Makes this a bauble-world to ape yon <mark4>real,</mark4><br>
These good things to match those as hips do <mark4>grapes.</mark4><br>
'Tis solace making baubles, ay, and <mark1>sport.</mark1><br>
Himself peeped late, eyed Prosper at his <mark4>books</mark4><br>
Careless and lofty, lord now of the <mark1>isle:</mark1><br>
Vexed, 'stitched a book of broad leaves, <mark4>arrow-shaped,</mark4><br>
Wrote thereon, he knows what, prodigious <mark4>words;</mark4><br>
Has peeled a wand and called it by a <mark4>name;</mark4><br>
Weareth at whiles for an enchanter's <mark4>robe</mark4><br>
The eyed skin of a supple <mark5>oncelot;</mark5><br>
And hath an ounce sleeker than youngling <mark4>mole,</mark4><br>
A four-legged serpent he makes cower and <mark1>couch,</mark1><br>
Now snarl, now hold its breath and mind his <mark1>eye,</mark1><br>
And saith she is Miranda and my <mark3>wife:</mark3><br>
'Keeps for his Ariel a tall pouch-bill <mark4>crane</mark4><br>
He bids go wade for fish and straight <mark4>disgorge;</mark4><br>
Also a sea-beast, lumpish, which he <mark4>snared,</mark4><br>
Blinded the eyes of, and brought somewhat <mark3>tame,</mark3><br>
And split its toe-webs, and now pens the <mark4>drudge</mark4><br>
In a hole o' the rock and calls him <mark1>Caliban;</mark1><br>
A bitter heart that bides its time and <mark4>bites.</mark4><br>
'Plays thus at being Prosper in a <mark1>way,</mark1><br>
Taketh his mirth with make-believes: so <mark1>He.</mark1><br>
His dam held that the Quiet made all <mark1>things</mark1><br>
Which Setebos vexed only: 'holds not <mark1>so.</mark1><br>
Who made them weak, meant weakness He might <mark4>vex.</mark4><br>
Had He meant other, while His hand was <mark4>in,</mark4><br>
Why not make horny eyes no thorn could <mark4>prick,</mark4><br>
Or plate my scalp with bone against the <mark3>snow,</mark3><br>
Or overscale my flesh 'neath joint and <mark4>joint</mark4><br>
Like an orc's armour? Ay,?so spoil His <mark1>sport!</mark1><br>
He is the One now: only He doth <mark1>all.</mark1><br>
<br>
'Saith, He may like, perchance, what profits <mark1>Him.</mark1><br>
Ay, himself loves what does him good; but <mark3>why?</mark3><br>
'Gets good no otherwise. This blinded <mark4>beast</mark4><br>
Loves whoso places flesh-meat on his <mark4>nose,</mark4><br>
But, had he eyes, would want no help, but <mark4>hate</mark4><br>
Or love, just as it liked him: He hath <mark4>eyes.</mark4><br>
Also it pleaseth Setebos to <mark4>work,</mark4><br>
Use all His hands, and exercise much <mark4>craft,</mark4><br>
By no means for the love of what is <mark4>worked.</mark4><br>
'Tasteth, himself, no finer good i' the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
When all goes right, in this safe <mark4>summer-time,</mark4><br>
And he wants little, hungers, aches not <mark4>much,</mark4><br>
Than trying what to do with wit and <mark4>strength.</mark4><br>
'Falls to make something: 'piled yon pile of turfs,<br>
And squared and stuck there squares of soft white <mark4>chalk,</mark4><br>
And, with a fish-tooth, scratched a moon on <mark4>each,</mark4><br>
And set up endwise certain spikes of <mark3>tree,</mark3><br>
And crowned the whole with a sloth's skull <mark4>a-top,</mark4><br>
Found dead i' the woods, too hard for one to <mark4>kill.</mark4><br>
No use at all i' the <mark4>work</mark4>, for work's sole <mark4>sake;</mark4><br>
'Shall some day knock it down again: so <mark1>He.</mark1><br>
<br>
'Saith He is terrible: watch His feats in <mark4>proof!</mark4><br>
One hurricane will spoil six good months' <mark4>hope.</mark4><br>
He hath a spite against me, that I <mark3>know,</mark3><br>
Just as He favours Prosper, who knows <mark1>why?</mark1><br>
So it is, all the same, as well I <mark4>find.</mark4><br>
'Wove wattles half the winter, fenced them <mark4>firm</mark4><br>
With stone and stake to stop <mark4>she-tortoises</mark4><br>
Crawling to lay their eggs here: well, one <mark1>wave,</mark1><br>
Feeling the foot of Him upon its <mark4>neck,</mark4><br>
Gaped as a snake does, lolled out its large <mark1>tongue,</mark1><br>
And licked the whole labour flat: so much for <mark1>spite.</mark1><br>
'Saw a ball flame down late (yonder it <mark4>lies)</mark4><br>
Where, half an hour before, I slept i' the <mark4>shade:</mark4><br>
Often they scatter sparkles: there is <mark4>force!</mark4><br>
'Dug up a newt He may have envied <mark4>once</mark4><br>
And turned to <mark1>stone</mark1>, shut up Inside a <mark4>stone.</mark4><br>
Please Him and hinder this??What Prosper <mark1>does?</mark1><br>
Aha, if He would tell me how! Not <mark1>He!</mark1><br>
There is the sport: discover how or <mark3>die!</mark3><br>
All need not die, for of the things o' the <mark1>isle</mark1><br>
Some flee afar, some dive, some run up <mark4>trees;</mark4><br>
Those at His mercy,?why, they please Him <mark4>most</mark4><br>
When . . . when . . . well, never try the same way <mark4>twice!</mark4><br>
Repeat what act has pleased, He may grow <mark5>wroth.</mark5><br>
You must not know His ways, and play Him <mark1>off,</mark1><br>
Sure of the issue. 'Doth the like <mark1>himself:</mark1><br>
'Spareth a squirrel that it nothing <mark4>fears</mark4><br>
But steals the nut from underneath my <mark4>thumb,</mark4><br>
And when I threat, bites stoutly in <mark4>defence:</mark4><br>
'Spareth an urchin that <mark5>contrariwise,</mark5><br>
Curls up into a ball, pretending <mark4>death</mark4><br>
For fright at my approach: the two ways <mark1>please.</mark1><br>
But what would move my choler more than <mark1>this,</mark1><br>
That either creature counted on its <mark1>life</mark1><br>
To-morrow and next day and all days to <mark3>come,</mark3><br>
Saying, forsooth, in the inmost of its <mark4>heart,</mark4><br>
"Because he did so yesterday with <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
And otherwise with such another <mark4>brute,</mark4><br>
So must he do henceforth and always."?Ay?<br>
Would teach the reasoning couple what "must" <mark4>means!</mark4><br>
'Doth as he likes, or wherefore Lord? So <mark1>He.</mark1><br>
<br>
'Conceiveth all things will continue <mark4>thus,</mark4><br>
And we shall have to live in fear of <mark1>Him</mark1><br>
So long as He lives, keeps His strength: no <mark4>change,</mark4><br>
If He have done His best, make no new <mark1>world</mark1><br>
To please Him more, so leave off watching <mark1>this,?</mark1><br>
If He surprise not even the Quiet's <mark1>self</mark1><br>
Some strange day,?or, suppose, grow into <mark1>it</mark1><br>
As grubs grow butterflies: else, here are <mark3>we,</mark3><br>
And there is He, and nowhere help at <mark1>all.</mark1><br>
<br>
'Believeth with the life, the pain shall <mark4>stop.</mark4><br>
His dam held different, that after <mark1>death</mark1><br>
He both plagued enemies and feasted <mark4>friends:</mark4><br>
Idly! He doth His worst in this our <mark1>life,</mark1><br>
Giving just respite lest we die through <mark4>pain,</mark4><br>
Saving last pain for worst,?with which, an <mark4>end.</mark4><br>
Meanwhile, the best way to escape His <mark4>ire</mark4><br>
Is, not to seem too happy. 'Sees, <mark1>himself,</mark1><br>
Yonder two flies, with purple films and <mark4>pink,</mark4><br>
Bask on the pompion-bell above: kills <mark4>both.</mark4><br>
'Sees two black painful beetles roll their <mark3>ball</mark3><br>
On head and tail as if to save their <mark4>lives:</mark4><br>
Moves them the stick away they strive to <mark4>clear.</mark4><br>
<br>
Even so, 'would have Him misconceive, <mark4>suppose</mark4><br>
This Caliban strives hard and ails no <mark4>less,</mark4><br>
And always, above all else, envies <mark1>Him;</mark1><br>
Wherefore he mainly dances on dark <mark4>nights,</mark4><br>
Moans in the sun, gets under holes to <mark1>laugh,</mark1><br>
And never speaks his mind save housed as <mark1>now:</mark1><br>
Outside, 'groans, curses. If He caught me <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
O'erheard this speech, and asked "What chucklest <mark4>at?"</mark4><br>
'Would, to appease Him, cut a finger <mark1>off,</mark1><br>
Or of my three kid yearlings burn the <mark1>best,</mark1><br>
Or let the toothsome apples rot on <mark1>tree,</mark1><br>
Or push my tame beast for the orc to <mark4>taste:</mark4><br>
While myself lit a fire, and made a <mark4>song</mark4><br>
And sung it, "What I <mark4>hate</mark4>, be <mark4>consecrate</mark4><br>
To celebrate Thee and Thy <mark3>state</mark3>, no <mark4>mate</mark4><br>
For <mark3>Thee</mark3>, what see for envy in poor <mark1>me?"</mark1><br>
Hoping the while, since evils sometimes <mark3>mend,</mark3><br>
Warts rub away and sores are cured with <mark4>slime,</mark4><br>
That some strange day, will either the Quiet <mark4>catch</mark4><br>
And conquer Setebos, or likelier <mark1>He</mark1><br>
Decrepit may doze, doze, as good as <mark1>die.</mark1><br>
<br>
[What, what? A curtain o'er the world at <mark1>once!</mark1><br>
Crickets stop hissing: not a bird?or, <mark4>yes,</mark4><br>
There scuds His raven that has told Him <mark1>all!</mark1><br>
It was fool's play, this prattling! Ha! The <mark4>wind</mark4><br>
Shoulders the pillared dust, death's house o' the <mark4>move,</mark4><br>
And fast invading fires begin! White <mark4>blaze?</mark4><br>
A tree's head snaps?and <mark1>there</mark1>, there, there, there, <mark4>there,</mark4><br>
His thunder follows! Fool to gibe at <mark1>Him!</mark1><br>
Lo! 'Lieth flat and loveth <mark1>Setebos!</mark1><br>
'Maketh his teeth meet through his upper <mark4>lip,</mark4><br>
Will let those quails fly, will not eat this <mark4>month</mark4><br>
One little mess of whelks, so he may 'scape!]<br>
