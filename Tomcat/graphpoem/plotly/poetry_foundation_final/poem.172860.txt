Title : Sohrab and Rustum <br>
Author : Matthew Arnold <br><br>

An <mark4>Episode</mark4><br>
AND the first grey of morning fill'd the <mark4>east,</mark4><br>
And the fog rose out of the Oxus <mark1>stream.</mark1><br>
But all the Tartar camp along the <mark1>stream</mark1><br>
Was hush'd, and still the men were plunged in <mark4>sleep;</mark4><br>
Sohrab alone, he slept not; all night <mark4>long</mark4><br>
He had lain wakeful, tossing on his <mark4>bed;</mark4><br>
But when the grey dawn stole into his <mark4>tent,</mark4><br>
He rose, and clad himself, and girt his <mark4>sword,</mark4><br>
And took his horseman's cloak, and left his <mark1>tent,</mark1><br>
And went abroad into the cold wet <mark1>fog,</mark1><br>
Through the dim camp to Peran-Wisa's <mark1>tent.</mark1><br>
<br>
Through the black Tartar tents he pass'd, which <mark4>stood</mark4><br>
Clustering like bee-hives on the low flat <mark4>strand</mark4><br>
Of Oxus, where the summer-floods <mark4>o'erflow</mark4><br>
When the sun melts the snows in high <mark1>Pamere;</mark1><br>
Through the black tents he pass'd, o'er that low <mark1>strand,</mark1><br>
And to a hillock came, a little <mark4>back</mark4><br>
From the stream's brink--the spot where first a <mark4>boat,</mark4><br>
Crossing the stream in summer, scrapes the <mark3>land.</mark3><br>
The men of former times had crown'd the <mark4>top</mark4><br>
With a clay fort; but that was fall'n, and <mark3>now</mark3><br>
The Tartars built there Peran-Wisa's <mark1>tent,</mark1><br>
A dome of laths, and o'er it felts were <mark4>spread.</mark4><br>
And Sohrab came there, and went in, and <mark1>stood</mark1><br>
Upon the thick piled carpets in the <mark1>tent,</mark1><br>
And found the old man sleeping on his <mark1>bed</mark1><br>
Of rugs and felts, and near him lay his <mark4>arms.</mark4><br>
And Peran-Wisa heard him, though the <mark4>step</mark4><br>
Was dull'd; for he slept light, an old man's <mark1>sleep;</mark1><br>
And he rose quickly on one arm, and <mark3>said:--</mark3><br>
<br>
"Who art thou? for it is not yet clear <mark4>dawn.</mark4><br>
Speak! is there news, or any night <mark4>alarm?"</mark4><br>
<br>
But Sohrab came to the <mark4>bedside</mark4>, and <mark1>said:--</mark1><br>
"Thou know'st me, Peran-Wisa! it is <mark3>I.</mark3><br>
The sun is not yet risen, and the <mark3>foe</mark3><br>
Sleep; but I sleep not; all night long I <mark3>lie</mark3><br>
Tossing and wakeful, and I come to <mark5>thee.</mark5><br>
For so did King Afrasiab bid me <mark4>seek</mark4><br>
Thy counsel, and to heed thee as thy <mark4>son,</mark4><br>
In Samarcand, before the army <mark4>march'd;</mark4><br>
And I will tell thee what my heart <mark4>desires.</mark4><br>
Thou know'st if, since from Ader-baijan <mark4>first</mark4><br>
I came among the Tartars and bore <mark1>arms,</mark1><br>
I have still served Afrasiab well, and <mark4>shown,</mark4><br>
At my boy's years, the courage of a <mark4>man.</mark4><br>
This too thou know'st, that while I still bear <mark4>on</mark4><br>
The conquering Tartar ensigns through the <mark4>world,</mark4><br>
And beat the Persians back on every <mark4>field,</mark4><br>
I seek one <mark4>man</mark4>, one man, and one <mark4>alone--</mark4><br>
Rustum, my father; who I hoped should <mark4>greet,</mark4><br>
Should one day greet, upon some well-fought <mark1>field,</mark1><br>
His not unworthy, not inglorious <mark1>son.</mark1><br>
So I long hoped, but him I never <mark4>find.</mark4><br>
Come then, hear now, and grant me what I <mark4>ask.</mark4><br>
Let the two armies rest to-day; but <mark1>I</mark1><br>
Will challenge forth the bravest Persian <mark4>lords</mark4><br>
To meet me, man to man; if I <mark4>prevail,</mark4><br>
Rustum will surely hear it; if I <mark4>fall--</mark4><br>
Old man, the dead need no <mark4>one</mark4>, claim no <mark4>kin.</mark4><br>
Dim is the rumour of a common <mark4>fight,</mark4><br>
Where host meets host, and many names are <mark4>sunk;</mark4><br>
But of a single combat fame speaks <mark4>clear."</mark4><br>
<br>
He spoke; and Peran-Wisa took the <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
Of the young man in his, and sigh'd, and <mark1>said:--</mark1><br>
<br>
"O Sohrab, an unquiet heart is <mark4>thine!</mark4><br>
Canst thou not rest among the Tartar <mark4>chiefs,</mark4><br>
And share the battle's common chance with <mark4>us</mark4><br>
Who love thee, but must press for ever <mark1>first,</mark1><br>
In single fight incurring single <mark4>risk,</mark4><br>
To find a father thou hast never <mark4>seen?</mark4><br>
That were far best, my son, to stay with <mark1>us</mark1><br>
Unmurmuring; in our tents, while it is <mark4>war,</mark4><br>
And when 'tis truce, then in Afrasiab's <mark4>towns.</mark4><br>
But, if this one desire indeed rules <mark3>all,</mark3><br>
To seek out Rustum--seek him not through <mark1>fight!</mark1><br>
Seek him in peace, and carry to his <mark1>arms,</mark1><br>
O Sohrab, carry an unwounded <mark1>son!</mark1><br>
But far hence seek him, for he is not <mark4>here.</mark4><br>
For now it is not as when I was <mark4>young,</mark4><br>
When Rustum was in front of every <mark3>fray;</mark3><br>
But now he keeps apart, and sits at <mark4>home,</mark4><br>
In Seistan, with Zal, his father <mark4>old.</mark4><br>
Whether that his own mighty strength at <mark4>last</mark4><br>
Feels the abhorr'd approaches of old <mark1>age,</mark1><br>
Or in some quarrel with the Persian <mark4>King.</mark4><br>
There go!--Thou wilt not? Yet my heart <mark5>forebodes</mark5><br>
Danger or death awaits thee on this <mark1>field.</mark1><br>
Fain would I know thee safe and well, though <mark4>lost</mark4><br>
To us; fain therefore send thee <mark4>hence</mark4>, in <mark4>peace</mark4><br>
To seek thy father, not seek single <mark4>fights</mark4><br>
In vain;--but who can keep the lion's <mark3>cub</mark3><br>
From ravening, and who govern Rustum's <mark1>son?</mark1><br>
Go, I will grant thee what thy heart <mark1>desires."</mark1><br>
<br>
So said he, and dropp'd Sohrab's hand, and <mark4>left</mark4><br>
His bed, and the warm rugs whereon he <mark3>lay;</mark3><br>
And o'er his chilly limbs his woollen <mark4>coat</mark4><br>
He pass'd, and tied his sandals on his <mark4>feet,</mark4><br>
And threw a white cloak round him, and he <mark4>took</mark4><br>
In his right hand a ruler's staff, no <mark1>sword;</mark1><br>
And on his head he set his sheep-skin <mark4>cap,</mark4><br>
Black, glossy, curl'd, the fleece of Kara-Kul;<br>
And raised the curtain of his tent, and <mark4>call'd</mark4><br>
His herald to his <mark4>side</mark4>, and went <mark4>abroad.</mark4><br>
<br>
The sun by this had risen, and clear'd the <mark1>fog</mark1><br>
From the broad Oxus and the glittering <mark4>sands.</mark4><br>
And from their tents the Tartar horsemen <mark4>filed</mark4><br>
Into the open plain; so Haman <mark4>bade--</mark4><br>
Haman, who next to Peran-Wisa <mark4>ruled</mark4><br>
The host, and still was in his lusty <mark4>prime.</mark4><br>
From their black tents, long files of horse, they <mark4>stream'd;</mark4><br>
As when some grey November morn the <mark4>files,</mark4><br>
In marching order spread, of long-neck'd <mark4>cranes</mark4><br>
Stream over Casbin and the southern <mark4>slopes</mark4><br>
Of Elburz, from the Aralian <mark4>estuaries,</mark4><br>
Or some frore Caspian <mark4>reed-bed</mark4>, southward <mark4>bound</mark4><br>
For the warm Persian sea-board--so they <mark1>stream'd.</mark1><br>
The Tartars of the Oxus, the King's <mark4>guard,</mark4><br>
First, with black sheep-skin caps and with long <mark4>spears;</mark4><br>
Large men, large steeds; who from Bokhara <mark4>come</mark4><br>
And Khiva, and ferment the milk of <mark4>mares.</mark4><br>
Next, the more temperate Toorkmuns of the <mark4>south,</mark4><br>
The Tukas, and the lances of Salore,<br>
And those from Attruck and the Caspian <mark1>sands;</mark1><br>
Light men and on light steeds, who only <mark4>drink</mark4><br>
The acrid milk of <mark4>camels</mark4>, and their <mark4>wells.</mark4><br>
And then a swarm of wandering horse, who <mark4>came</mark4><br>
From far, and a more doubtful service <mark4>own'd;</mark4><br>
The Tartars of Ferghana, from the <mark4>banks</mark4><br>
Of the Jaxartes, men with scanty <mark4>beards</mark4><br>
And close-set skull-caps; and those wilder <mark4>hordes</mark4><br>
Who roam o'er Kipchak and the northern <mark4>waste,</mark4><br>
Kalmucks and unkempt Kuzzaks, tribes who <mark3>stray</mark3><br>
Nearest the Pole, and wandering Kirghizzes,<br>
Who come on shaggy ponies from <mark1>Pamere;</mark1><br>
These all filed out from camp into the <mark4>plain.</mark4><br>
And on the other side the Persians <mark4>form'd;--</mark4><br>
First a light cloud of horse, Tartars they <mark4>seem'd,</mark4><br>
The Ilyats of Khorassan, and <mark4>behind,</mark4><br>
The royal troops of Persia, horse and <mark4>foot,</mark4><br>
Marshall'd battalions bright in burnish'd <mark4>steel.</mark4><br>
But Peran-Wisa with his herald <mark1>came,</mark1><br>
Threading the Tartar squadrons to the <mark4>front,</mark4><br>
And with his staff kept back the foremost <mark3>ranks.</mark3><br>
And when Ferood, who led the Persians, <mark1>saw</mark1><br>
That Peran-Wisa kept the Tartars <mark1>back,</mark1><br>
He took his spear, and to the front he <mark1>came,</mark1><br>
And check'd his ranks, and fix'd them where they <mark1>stood.</mark1><br>
And the old Tartar came upon the <mark4>sand</mark4><br>
Betwixt the silent hosts, and spake, and <mark1>said:--</mark1><br>
<br>
"Ferood, and ye, Persians and Tartars, <mark2>hear!</mark2><br>
Let there be truce between the hosts <mark3>to-day.</mark3><br>
But choose a champion from the Persian <mark1>lords</mark1><br>
To fight our champion Sohrab, man to <mark1>man."</mark1><br>
<br>
As, in the country, on a morn in <mark4>June,</mark4><br>
When the dew glistens on the pearled <mark4>ears,</mark4><br>
A shiver runs through the deep corn for <mark1>joy--</mark1><br>
So, when they heard what Peran-Wisa <mark1>said,</mark1><br>
A thrill through all the Tartar squadrons <mark4>ran</mark4><br>
Of pride and hope for Sohrab, whom they <mark4>loved.</mark4><br>
<br>
       But as a troop of pedlars, from Cabool,<br>
Cross underneath the Indian <mark4>Caucasus,</mark4><br>
That vast sky-neighbouring mountain of milk <mark3>snow;</mark3><br>
Crossing so high, that, as they mount, they <mark4>pass</mark4><br>
Long flocks of travelling birds dead on the <mark1>snow,</mark1><br>
Choked by the air, and scarce can they <mark4>themselves</mark4><br>
Slake their parch'd throats with sugar'd mulberries--<br>
In single file they move, and stop their <mark4>breath,</mark4><br>
For fear they should dislodge the o'erhanging <mark4>snows--</mark4><br>
So the pale Persians held their breath with <mark4>fear.</mark4><br>
<br>
And to Ferood his brother chiefs came <mark4>up</mark4><br>
To counsel; Gudurz and Zoarrah <mark1>came,</mark1><br>
And Feraburz, who ruled the Persian <mark4>host</mark4><br>
Second, and was the uncle of the <mark1>King;</mark1><br>
These came and counsell'd, and then Gudurz <mark1>said:--</mark1><br>
<br>
"Ferood, shame bids us take their challenge <mark1>up,</mark1><br>
Yet champion have we none to match this <mark4>youth.</mark4><br>
He has the wild stag's <mark4>foot</mark4>, the lion's <mark4>heart.</mark4><br>
But Rustum came last night; aloof he <mark4>sits</mark4><br>
And sullen, and has pitch'd his tents <mark3>apart.</mark3><br>
Him will I seek, and carry to his <mark3>ear</mark3><br>
The Tartar challenge, and this young man's <mark3>name.</mark3><br>
Haply he will forget his wrath, and <mark1>fight.</mark1><br>
Stand forth the while, and take their challenge <mark1>up."</mark1><br>
<br>
So spake he; and Ferood stood forth and <mark4>cried:--</mark4><br>
"Old man, be it agreed as thou hast <mark1>said!</mark1><br>
Let Sohrab arm, and we will find a <mark1>man."</mark1><br>
<br>
He spake: and Peran-Wisa turn'd, and <mark4>strode</mark4><br>
Back through the opening squadrons to his <mark1>tent.</mark1><br>
But through the anxious Persians Gudurz <mark1>ran,</mark1><br>
And cross'd the camp which lay behind, and <mark4>reach'd,</mark4><br>
Out on the sands beyond it, Rustum's <mark4>tents.</mark4><br>
Of scarlet cloth they were, and glittering <mark3>gay,</mark3><br>
Just pitch'd; the high pavilion in the <mark4>midst</mark4><br>
Was Rustum's, and his men lay camp'd <mark4>around.</mark4><br>
And Gudurz enter'd Rustum's tent, and <mark3>found</mark3><br>
Rustum; his morning meal was done, but <mark4>still</mark4><br>
The table stood before him, charged with <mark4>food--</mark4><br>
A side of roasted sheep, and cakes of <mark4>bread,</mark4><br>
And dark green melons; and there Rustum <mark4>sate</mark4><br>
Listless, and held a falcon on his <mark4>wrist,</mark4><br>
And play'd with it; but Gudurz came and <mark1>stood</mark1><br>
Before him; and he look'd, and saw him <mark4>stand,</mark4><br>
And with a cry sprang up and dropp'd the <mark4>bird,</mark4><br>
And greeted Gudurz with both hands, and <mark1>said:--</mark1><br>
<br>
"Welcome! these eyes could see no better <mark4>sight.</mark4><br>
What news? but sit down first, and eat and <mark1>drink."</mark1><br>
<br>
But Gudurz stood in the tent-door, and <mark1>said:--</mark1><br>
"Not now! a time will come to eat and <mark1>drink,</mark1><br>
But not to-day; to-day has other <mark4>needs.</mark4><br>
The armies are drawn out, and stand at <mark4>gaze;</mark4><br>
For from the Tartars is a challenge <mark4>brought</mark4><br>
To pick a champion from the Persian <mark1>lords</mark1><br>
To fight their champion--and thou know'st his <mark1>name--</mark1><br>
Sohrab men call him, but his birth is <mark4>hid.</mark4><br>
O Rustum, like thy might is this young <mark4>man's!</mark4><br>
He has the wild stag's <mark4>foot</mark4>, the lion's <mark1>heart;</mark1><br>
And he is young, and Iran's chiefs are <mark1>old,</mark1><br>
Or else too weak; and all eyes turn to <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
Come down and help us, Rustum, or we <mark4>lose!''</mark4><br>
<br>
He spoke; but Rustum answer'd with a <mark4>smile:--</mark4><br>
"Go to! if Iran's chiefs are old, then <mark1>I</mark1><br>
Am older; if the young are weak, the <mark1>King</mark1><br>
Errs strangely; for the King, for Kai <mark1>Khosroo,</mark1><br>
Himself is young, and honours younger <mark4>men,</mark4><br>
And lets the aged moulder to their <mark4>graves.</mark4><br>
Rustum he loves no more, but loves the <mark1>young--</mark1><br>
The young may rise at Sohrab's vaunts, not <mark1>I.</mark1><br>
For what care I, though all speak Sohrab's <mark3>fame?</mark3><br>
For would that I myself had such a <mark1>son,</mark1><br>
And not that one slight helpless girl I <mark4>have--</mark4><br>
A son so famed, so brave, to send to <mark1>war,</mark1><br>
And I to tarry with the snow-hair'd <mark1>Zal,</mark1><br>
My father, whom the robber Afghans <mark4>vex,</mark4><br>
And clip his borders short, and drive his <mark4>herds,</mark4><br>
And he has none to guard his weak old <mark1>age.</mark1><br>
There would I go, and hang my armour <mark1>up,</mark1><br>
And with my great name fence that weak old <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
And spend the goodly treasures I have <mark4>got,</mark4><br>
And rest my age, and hear of Sohrab's <mark1>fame,</mark1><br>
And leave to death the hosts of thankless <mark4>kings,</mark4><br>
And with these slaughterous hands draw sword no <mark3>more.''</mark3><br>
<br>
He spoke, and smiled; and Gudurz made <mark3>reply:--</mark3><br>
"What then, O Rustum, will men say to <mark4>this,</mark4><br>
When Sohrab dares our bravest forth, and <mark4>seeks</mark4><br>
Thee most of all, and thou, whom most he <mark1>seeks,</mark1><br>
Hidest thy face? Take heed lest men should <mark3>say:</mark3><br>
Like some old miser, Rustum hoards his <mark1>fame,</mark1><br>
And shuns to peril it with younger <mark1>men."</mark1><br>
<br>
And, greatly moved, then Rustum made <mark1>reply:--</mark1><br>
"O Gudurz, wherefore dost thou say such <mark4>words?</mark4><br>
Thou knowest better words than this to <mark1>say.</mark1><br>
What is one more, one less, obscure or <mark4>famed,</mark4><br>
Valiant or craven, young or old, to <mark3>me?</mark3><br>
Are not they mortal, am not I <mark4>myself?</mark4><br>
But who for men of nought would do great <mark4>deeds?</mark4><br>
<mark4>Come</mark4>, thou shalt see how Rustum hoards his <mark1>fame!</mark1><br>
But I will fight unknown, and in plain <mark1>arms;</mark1><br>
Let not men say of Rustum, he was <mark4>match'd</mark4><br>
In single fight with any mortal <mark1>man."</mark1><br>
<br>
He spoke, and frown'd; and Gudurz turn'd, and <mark1>ran</mark1><br>
Back quickly through the camp in fear and <mark1>joy--</mark1><br>
Fear at his wrath, but joy that Rustum <mark1>came.</mark1><br>
But Rustum strode to his tent-door, and <mark1>call'd</mark1><br>
His followers in, and bade them bring his <mark1>arms,</mark1><br>
And clad himself in steel; the arms he <mark4>chose</mark4><br>
Were plain, and on his shield was no <mark4>device,</mark4><br>
Only his helm was rich, inlaid with <mark4>gold,</mark4><br>
And, from the fluted spine atop, a <mark4>plume</mark4><br>
Of horsehair waved, a scarlet horsehair <mark1>plume.</mark1><br>
So arm'd, he issued forth; and Ruksh, his <mark4>horse,</mark4><br>
Follow'd him like a faithful hound at <mark4>heel--</mark4><br>
Ruksh, whose renown was noised through all the <mark4>earth,</mark4><br>
The <mark4>horse</mark4>, whom Rustum on a foray <mark4>once</mark4><br>
Did in Bokhara by the river <mark1>find</mark1><br>
A colt beneath its <mark4>dam</mark4>, and drove him <mark1>home,</mark1><br>
And rear'd him; a bright bay, with lofty <mark4>crest,</mark4><br>
Dight with a saddle-cloth of broider'd <mark4>green</mark4><br>
Crusted with gold, and on the ground were <mark4>work'd</mark4><br>
All beasts of chase, all beasts which hunters <mark3>know.</mark3><br>
So follow'd, Rustum left his tents, and <mark4>cross'd</mark4><br>
The camp, and to the Persian host <mark4>appear'd.</mark4><br>
And all the Persians knew him, and with <mark4>shouts</mark4><br>
<mark4>Hail'd</mark4>, but the Tartars knew not who he <mark4>was.</mark4><br>
And dear as the wet diver to the <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
Of his pale wife who waits and weeps on <mark3>shore,</mark3><br>
By sandy Bahrein, in the Persian <mark4>Gulf,</mark4><br>
Plunging all day in the blue waves, at <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
Having made up his tale of precious <mark4>pearls,</mark4><br>
Rejoins her in their hut upon the <mark1>sands--</mark1><br>
So dear to the pale Persians Rustum <mark1>came.</mark1><br>
<br>
And Rustum to the Persian front <mark4>advanced,</mark4><br>
And Sohrab arm'd in Haman's tent, and <mark1>came.</mark1><br>
And as afield the reapers cut a <mark4>swath</mark4><br>
Down through the middle of a rich man's <mark4>corn,</mark4><br>
And on each side are squares of standing <mark1>corn,</mark1><br>
And in the midst a stubble, short and <mark4>bare--</mark4><br>
So on each side were squares of men, with <mark1>spears</mark1><br>
Bristling, and in the midst, the open <mark1>sand.</mark1><br>
And Rustum came upon the sand, and <mark4>cast</mark4><br>
His eyes toward the Tartar tents, and <mark1>saw</mark1><br>
Sohrab come forth, and eyed him as he <mark1>came.</mark1><br>
<br>
As some rich <mark4>woman</mark4>, on a winter's <mark3>morn,</mark3><br>
Eyes through her silken curtains the poor <mark4>drudge</mark4><br>
Who with numb blacken'd fingers makes her <mark4>fire--</mark4><br>
At cock-crow, on a starlit winter's <mark1>morn,</mark1><br>
When the frost flowers the whiten'd <mark4>window-panes--</mark4><br>
And wonders how she lives, and what the <mark4>thoughts</mark4><br>
Of that poor drudge may be; so Rustum <mark4>eyed</mark4><br>
The unknown adventurous youth, who from <mark4>afar</mark4><br>
Came seeking Rustum, and defying <mark4>forth</mark4><br>
All the most valiant chiefs; long he <mark4>perused</mark4><br>
His spirited air, and wonder'd who he <mark1>was.</mark1><br>
For very young he <mark4>seem'd</mark4>, tenderly <mark4>rear'd;</mark4><br>
Like some young cypress, tall, and dark, and <mark4>straight,</mark4><br>
Which in a queen's secluded garden <mark4>throws</mark4><br>
Its slight dark shadow on the moonlit <mark4>turf,</mark4><br>
By midnight, to a bubbling fountain's <mark4>sound--</mark4><br>
So slender Sohrab <mark4>seem'd</mark4>, so softly <mark1>rear'd.</mark1><br>
And a deep pity enter'd Rustum's <mark4>soul</mark4><br>
As he beheld him coming; and he <mark1>stood,</mark1><br>
And beckon'd to him with his <mark4>hand</mark4>, and <mark1>said:--</mark1><br>
<br>
"O thou young man, the air of Heaven is <mark4>soft,</mark4><br>
And warm, and pleasant; but the grave is <mark4>cold!</mark4><br>
Heaven's air is better than the cold dead <mark4>grave.</mark4><br>
Behold me! I am vast, and clad in <mark4>iron,</mark4><br>
And <mark4>tried</mark4>, and I have stood on many a <mark1>field</mark1><br>
Of blood, and I have fought with many a <mark1>foe--</mark1><br>
Never was that field lost, or that foe <mark4>saved.</mark4><br>
O Sohrab, wherefore wilt thou rush on <mark4>death?</mark4><br>
Be govern'd! quit the Tartar host, and <mark1>come</mark1><br>
To Iran, and be as my son to <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
And fight beneath my banner till I <mark3>die!</mark3><br>
There are no youths in Iran brave as <mark3>thou."</mark3><br>
<br>
So he spake, mildly; Sohrab heard his <mark4>voice,</mark4><br>
The mighty voice of Rustum, and he <mark1>saw</mark1><br>
His giant figure planted on the <mark1>sand,</mark1><br>
Sole, like some single tower, which a <mark4>chief</mark4><br>
Hath builded on the waste in former <mark3>years</mark3><br>
Against the robbers; and he saw that <mark4>head,</mark4><br>
Streak'd with its first grey hairs;--hope filled his <mark1>soul,</mark1><br>
And he ran forward and embraced his <mark4>knees,</mark4><br>
And clasp'd his hand within his own, and <mark1>said:--</mark1><br>
<br>
"O, by thy father's head! by thine own <mark1>soul!</mark1><br>
Art thou not Rustum? speak! art thou not <mark3>he?"</mark3><br>
<br>
But Rustum eyed askance the kneeling <mark1>youth,</mark1><br>
And turn'd away, and spake to his own <mark1>soul:--</mark1><br>
<br>
"Ah me, I muse what this young fox may <mark4>mean!</mark4><br>
False, wily, boastful, are these Tartar <mark4>boys.</mark4><br>
For if I now confess this thing he <mark4>asks,</mark4><br>
And hide it not, but say: Rustum is <mark1>here!</mark1><br>
He will not yield indeed, nor quit our <mark4>foes,</mark4><br>
But he will find some pretext not to <mark1>fight,</mark1><br>
And praise my fame, and proffer courteous <mark4>gifts,</mark4><br>
A belt or sword perhaps, and go his <mark3>way.</mark3><br>
And on a feast-tide, in Afrasiab's <mark4>hall,</mark4><br>
In Samarcand, he will arise and <mark3>cry:</mark3><br>
'I challenged once, when the two armies <mark4>camp'd</mark4><br>
Beside the Oxus, all the Persian <mark1>lords</mark1><br>
To cope with me in single fight; but <mark3>they</mark3><br>
Shrank, only Rustum dared; then he and <mark1>I</mark1><br>
Changed gifts, and went on equal terms <mark3>away.'</mark3><br>
So will he speak, perhaps, while men <mark4>applaud;</mark4><br>
Then were the chiefs of Iran shamed through <mark1>me."</mark1><br>
<br>
And then he turn'd, and sternly spake <mark4>aloud:--</mark4><br>
"Rise! wherefore dost thou vainly question <mark4>thus</mark4><br>
Of Rustum? I am here, whom thou hast <mark1>call'd</mark1><br>
By challenge forth; make good thy vaunt, or <mark4>yield!</mark4><br>
Is it with Rustum only thou wouldst <mark1>fight?</mark1><br>
Rash boy, men look on Rustum's face and <mark3>flee!</mark3><br>
For well I know, that did great Rustum <mark1>stand</mark1><br>
Before thy face this day, and were <mark4>reveal'd,</mark4><br>
There would be then no talk of fighting <mark1>more.</mark1><br>
But being what I am, I tell thee <mark1>this--</mark1><br>
Do thou record it in thine inmost <mark1>soul:</mark1><br>
Either thou shalt renounce thy vaunt and <mark1>yield,</mark1><br>
Or else thy bones shall strew this sand, till <mark4>winds</mark4><br>
Bleach them, or Oxus with his <mark4>summer-floods,</mark4><br>
Oxus in summer wash them all <mark1>away."</mark1><br>
<br>
He spoke; and Sohrab answer'd, on his <mark1>feet:--</mark1><br>
"Art thou so fierce? Thou wilt not fright me <mark3>so!</mark3><br>
I am no girl, to be made pale by <mark1>words.</mark1><br>
Yet this thou hast said well, did Rustum <mark1>stand</mark1><br>
Here on this field, there were no fighting <mark4>then.</mark4><br>
But Rustum is far hence, and we stand <mark1>here.</mark1><br>
Begin! thou art more vast, more dread than <mark1>I,</mark1><br>
And thou art proved, I know, and I am <mark1>young--</mark1><br>
But yet success sways with the breath of <mark4>Heaven.</mark4><br>
And though thou thinkest that thou knowest <mark4>sure</mark4><br>
Thy victory, yet thou canst not surely <mark1>know.</mark1><br>
For we are all, like swimmers in the <mark3>sea,</mark3><br>
Poised on the top of a huge wave of <mark4>fate,</mark4><br>
Which hangs uncertain to which side to <mark1>fall.</mark1><br>
And whether it will heave us up to <mark1>land,</mark1><br>
Or whether it will roll us out to <mark1>sea,</mark1><br>
Back out to sea, to the deep waves of <mark1>death,</mark1><br>
We know not, and no search will make us <mark1>know;</mark1><br>
Only the event will teach us in its <mark4>hour."</mark4><br>
<br>
He spoke, and Rustum answer'd not, but <mark4>hurl'd</mark4><br>
His spear; down from the shoulder, down it <mark1>came,</mark1><br>
As on some partridge in the corn a <mark4>hawk,</mark4><br>
That long has tower'd in the airy <mark4>clouds,</mark4><br>
Drops like a plummet; Sohrab saw it <mark1>come,</mark1><br>
And sprang aside, quick as a flash; the <mark4>spear</mark4><br>
Hiss'd, and went quivering down into the <mark1>sand,</mark1><br>
Which it sent flying wide;--then Sohrab <mark5>threw</mark5><br>
In turn, and full struck Rustum's shield; sharp <mark4>rang,</mark4><br>
The iron plates rang sharp, but turn'd the <mark1>spear.</mark1><br>
And Rustum seized his club, which none but <mark1>he</mark1><br>
Could wield; an unlopp'd trunk it was, and <mark4>huge,</mark4><br>
Still rough--like those which men in treeless <mark4>plains</mark4><br>
To build them boats fish from the flooded <mark4>rivers,</mark4><br>
Hyphasis or Hydaspes, when, high <mark1>up</mark1><br>
By their dark springs, the wind in <mark4>winter-time</mark4><br>
Hath made in Himalayan forests <mark4>wrack,</mark4><br>
And strewn the channels with torn boughs--so <mark1>huge</mark1><br>
The club which Rustum lifted now, and <mark4>struck</mark4><br>
One stroke; but again Sohrab sprang <mark4>aside,</mark4><br>
Lithe as the glancing snake, and the club <mark1>came</mark1><br>
Thundering to earth, and leapt from Rustum's <mark1>hand.</mark1><br>
And Rustum follow'd his own blow, and <mark4>fell</mark4><br>
To his knees, and with his fingers clutch'd the <mark1>sand;</mark1><br>
And now might Sohrab have unsheathed his <mark1>sword,</mark1><br>
And pierced the mighty Rustum while he <mark1>lay</mark1><br>
Dizzy, and on his knees, and choked with <mark1>sand;</mark1><br>
But he look'd on, and <mark4>smiled</mark4>, nor bared his <mark1>sword,</mark1><br>
But courteously drew back, and spoke, and <mark1>said:--</mark1><br>
<br>
"Thou strik'st too hard! that club of thine will <mark4>float</mark4><br>
Upon the <mark4>summer-floods</mark4>, and not my <mark4>bones.</mark4><br>
But rise, and be not wroth! not wroth am <mark1>I;</mark1><br>
No, when I see thee, wrath forsakes my <mark1>soul.</mark1><br>
Thou say'st, thou art not Rustum; be it <mark1>so!</mark1><br>
Who art thou then, that canst so touch my <mark1>soul?</mark1><br>
Boy as I am, I have seen battles <mark3>too--</mark3><br>
Have waded foremost in their bloody <mark4>waves,</mark4><br>
And heard their hollow roar of dying <mark1>men;</mark1><br>
But never was my heart thus touch'd <mark4>before.</mark4><br>
Are they from Heaven, these softenings of the <mark1>heart?</mark1><br>
O thou old warrior, let us yield to <mark1>Heaven!</mark1><br>
Come, plant we here in earth our angry <mark1>spears,</mark1><br>
And make a truce, and sit upon this <mark1>sand,</mark1><br>
And pledge each other in red wine, like <mark4>friends,</mark4><br>
And thou shalt talk to me of Rustum's <mark1>deeds.</mark1><br>
There are enough foes in the Persian <mark1>host,</mark1><br>
Whom I may meet, and strike, and feel no <mark3>pang;</mark3><br>
Champions enough Afrasiab has, whom <mark1>thou</mark1><br>
Mayst fight; fight them, when they confront thy <mark1>spear!</mark1><br>
But oh, let there be peace 'twixt thee and <mark1>me!"</mark1><br>
<br>
He ceased, but while he spake, Rustum had <mark4>risen,</mark4><br>
And stood erect, trembling with rage; his <mark3>club</mark3><br>
He left to lie, but had regain'd his <mark1>spear,</mark1><br>
Whose fiery point now in his mail'd <mark3>right-hand</mark3><br>
Blazed bright and baleful, like that <mark4>autumn-star,</mark4><br>
The baleful sign of <mark4>fevers</mark4>, dust had <mark4>soil'd</mark4><br>
His stately crest, and dimm'd his glittering <mark1>arms.</mark1><br>
His breast heaved, his lips foam'd, and twice his <mark1>voice</mark1><br>
Was choked with rage; at last these words broke <mark1>way:--</mark1><br>
<br>
"Girl! nimble with thy feet, not with thy <mark4>hands!</mark4><br>
Curl'd minion, dancer, coiner of sweet <mark1>words!</mark1><br>
Fight, let me hear thy hateful voice no <mark1>more!</mark1><br>
Thou art not in Afrasiab's gardens <mark1>now</mark1><br>
With Tartar girls, with whom thou art wont to <mark4>dance;</mark4><br>
But on the Oxus-sands, and in the <mark1>dance</mark1><br>
Of battle, and with me, who make no <mark3>play</mark3><br>
Of war; I fight it out, and hand to <mark1>hand.</mark1><br>
Speak not to me of truce, and pledge, and <mark4>wine!</mark4><br>
Remember all thy valour; try thy feints<br>
And cunning! all the pity I had is <mark4>gone;</mark4><br>
Because thou hast shamed me before both the <mark4>hosts</mark4><br>
With thy light skipping tricks, and thy girl's <mark4>wiles."</mark4><br>
<br>
He spoke, and Sohrab kindled at his <mark4>taunts,</mark4><br>
And he too drew his sword; at once they <mark4>rush'd</mark4><br>
Together, as two eagles on one <mark3>prey</mark3><br>
Come rushing down together from the <mark1>clouds,</mark1><br>
One from the east, one from the west; their <mark4>shields</mark4><br>
Dash'd with a clang together, and a <mark4>din</mark4><br>
Rose, such as that the sinewy woodcutters<br>
Make often in the forest's heart at <mark1>morn,</mark1><br>
Of hewing <mark4>axes</mark4>, crashing trees--such <mark4>blows</mark4><br>
Rustum and Sohrab on each other <mark4>hail'd.</mark4><br>
And you would say that sun and stars took <mark4>part</mark4><br>
In that unnatural conflict; for a <mark4>cloud</mark4><br>
Grew suddenly in <mark4>Heaven</mark4>, and dark'd the <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
Over the fighters' <mark4>heads</mark4>, and a wind <mark4>rose</mark4><br>
Under their feet, and moaning swept the <mark1>plain,</mark1><br>
And in a sandy whirlwind wrapp'd the <mark4>pair.</mark4><br>
In gloom they twain were wrapp'd, and they <mark1>alone;</mark1><br>
For both the on-looking hosts on either <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
Stood in broad daylight, and the sky was <mark4>pure,</mark4><br>
And the sun sparkled on the Oxus <mark1>stream.</mark1><br>
But in the gloom they fought, with bloodshot <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
And labouring breath; first Rustum struck the <mark4>shield</mark4><br>
Which Sohrab held stiff out; the steel-spiked <mark1>spear</mark1><br>
Rent the tough plates, but fail'd to reach the <mark4>skin,</mark4><br>
And Rustum pluck'd it back with angry <mark4>groan.</mark4><br>
Then Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum's <mark4>helm,</mark4><br>
Nor clove its steel quite through; but all the <mark1>crest</mark1><br>
He shore away, and that proud horsehair <mark1>plume,</mark1><br>
Never till now defiled, sank to the <mark4>dust;</mark4><br>
And Rustum bow'd his head; but then the <mark3>gloom</mark3><br>
Grew blacker, thunder rumbled in the <mark4>air,</mark4><br>
And lightnings rent the cloud; and Ruksh, the <mark1>horse,</mark1><br>
Who stood at hand, utter'd a dreadful <mark1>cry;--</mark1><br>
No horse's cry was that, most like the <mark4>roar</mark4><br>
Of some pain'd desert-lion, who all <mark3>day</mark3><br>
Hath trail'd the hunter's javelin in his <mark4>side,</mark4><br>
And comes at night to die upon the <mark1>sand.</mark1><br>
The two hosts heard that cry, and quaked for <mark1>fear,</mark1><br>
And Oxus curdled as it cross'd his <mark1>stream.</mark1><br>
But Sohrab heard, and quail'd not, but rush'd <mark1>on,</mark1><br>
And struck again; and again Rustum <mark4>bow'd</mark4><br>
His head; but this time all the blade, like <mark4>glass,</mark4><br>
Sprang in a thousand shivers on the <mark1>helm,</mark1><br>
And in the hand the hilt remain'd <mark1>alone.</mark1><br>
Then Rustum raised his head; his dreadful <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
Glared, and he shook on high his menacing <mark1>spear,</mark1><br>
And shouted: Rustum!--Sohrab heard that <mark4>shout,</mark4><br>
And shrank amazed; back he recoil'd one <mark1>step,</mark1><br>
And scann'd with blinking eyes the advancing <mark4>form,</mark4><br>
And then he stood bewilder'd; and he dropp'd<br>
His covering <mark4>shield</mark4>, and the spear pierced his <mark1>side.</mark1><br>
He reel'd, and staggering back, sank to the <mark4>ground;</mark4><br>
And then the gloom dispersed, and the wind <mark1>fell,</mark1><br>
And the bright sun broke forth, and melted <mark1>all</mark1><br>
The cloud; and the two armies saw the <mark1>pair--</mark1><br>
Saw Rustum standing, safe upon his <mark1>feet,</mark1><br>
And Sohrab, <mark4>wounded</mark4>, on the bloody <mark1>sand.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then, with a bitter smile, Rustum <mark4>began:--</mark4><br>
"Sohrab, thou thoughtest in thy mind to <mark4>kill</mark4><br>
A Persian lord this day, and strip his <mark4>corpse,</mark4><br>
And bear thy trophies to Afrasiab's <mark1>tent.</mark1><br>
Or else that the great Rustum would come <mark4>down</mark4><br>
Himself to fight, and that thy wiles would <mark4>move</mark4><br>
His heart to take a gift, and let thee <mark3>go.</mark3><br>
And then that all the Tartar host would <mark4>praise</mark4><br>
Thy courage or thy craft, and spread thy <mark1>fame,</mark1><br>
To glad thy father in his weak old <mark1>age.</mark1><br>
Fool, thou art <mark4>slain</mark4>, and by an unknown <mark1>man!</mark1><br>
Dearer to the red jackals shalt thou <mark3>be</mark3><br>
Than to thy friends, and to thy father <mark1>old."</mark1><br>
<br>
And, with a fearless mien, Sohrab <mark4>replied:--</mark4><br>
"Unknown thou art; yet thy fierce vaunt is <mark4>vain.</mark4><br>
Thou dost not slay me, proud and boastful <mark1>man!</mark1><br>
No! Rustum slays me, and this filial <mark1>heart.</mark1><br>
For were I match'd with ten such men as <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
And I were that which till to-day I <mark1>was,</mark1><br>
They should be lying <mark4>here</mark4>, I standing <mark3>there.</mark3><br>
But that beloved name unnerved my <mark4>arm--</mark4><br>
That name, and something, I confess, in <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
Which troubles all my heart, and made my <mark1>shield</mark1><br>
Fall; and thy spear transfix'd an unarm'd <mark1>foe.</mark1><br>
And now thou boastest, and insult'st my <mark1>fate.</mark1><br>
But hear thou this, fierce man, tremble to <mark1>hear:</mark1><br>
The mighty Rustum shall avenge my <mark1>death!</mark1><br>
My father, whom I seek through all the <mark1>world,</mark1><br>
He shall avenge my death, and punish <mark1>thee!"</mark1><br>
<br>
As when some hunter in the spring hath <mark1>found</mark1><br>
A breeding eagle sitting on her <mark4>nest,</mark4><br>
Upon the craggy isle of a <mark4>hill-lake,</mark4><br>
And pierced her with an arrow as she <mark1>rose,</mark1><br>
And follow'd her to find her where she <mark1>fell</mark1><br>
Far off;--anon her mate comes winging <mark1>back</mark1><br>
From hunting, and a great way off <mark5>descries</mark5><br>
His huddling young left sole; at that, he <mark4>checks</mark4><br>
His pinion, and with short uneasy <mark4>sweeps</mark4><br>
Circles above his eyry, with loud <mark4>screams</mark4><br>
Chiding his mate back to her nest; but <mark3>she</mark3><br>
Lies dying, with the arrow in her <mark1>side,</mark1><br>
In some far stony gorge out of his <mark4>ken,</mark4><br>
A heap of fluttering feathers--never <mark1>more</mark1><br>
Shall the lake glass her, flying over <mark4>it;</mark4><br>
Never the black and dripping <mark5>precipices</mark5><br>
Echo her stormy scream as she sails <mark3>by--</mark3><br>
As that poor bird flies home, nor knows his <mark4>loss,</mark4><br>
So Rustum knew not his own loss, but <mark1>stood</mark1><br>
Over his dying son, and knew him <mark4>not.</mark4><br>
<br>
But, with a cold, incredulous voice, he <mark1>said:--</mark1><br>
"What prate is this of fathers and <mark4>revenge?</mark4><br>
The mighty Rustum never had a <mark1>son."</mark1><br>
<br>
And, with a failing voice, Sohrab <mark1>replied:--</mark1><br>
"Ah yes, he had! and that lost son am <mark1>I.</mark1><br>
Surely the news will one day reach his <mark1>ear,</mark1><br>
Reach Rustum, where he sits, and tarries <mark1>long,</mark1><br>
<mark4>Somewhere</mark4>, I know not where, but far from <mark1>here;</mark1><br>
And pierce him like a stab, and make him <mark4>leap</mark4><br>
To arms, and cry for vengeance upon <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
Fierce man, bethink thee, for an only <mark1>son!</mark1><br>
What will that grief, what will that vengeance <mark1>be?</mark1><br>
Oh, could I live, till I that grief had <mark1>seen!</mark1><br>
Yet him I pity not so much, but <mark5>her,</mark5><br>
My mother, who in Ader-baijan <mark4>dwells</mark4><br>
With that old king, her father, who grows <mark3>grey</mark3><br>
With age, and rules over the valiant Koords.<br>
Her most I pity, who no more will <mark3>see</mark3><br>
Sohrab returning from the Tartar <mark4>camp,</mark4><br>
With spoils and honour, when the war is <mark4>done.</mark4><br>
But a dark rumour will be bruited <mark1>up,</mark1><br>
From tribe to tribe, until it reach her <mark1>ear;</mark1><br>
And then will that defenceless woman <mark4>learn</mark4><br>
That Sohrab will rejoice her sight no <mark1>more,</mark1><br>
But that in battle with a nameless <mark1>foe,</mark1><br>
By the far-distant Oxus, he is <mark4>slain."</mark4><br>
<br>
He spoke; and as he ceased, he wept <mark1>aloud,</mark1><br>
Thinking of her he left, and his own <mark1>death.</mark1><br>
He spoke; but Rustum listen'd, plunged in <mark4>thought.</mark4><br>
Nor did he yet believe it was his <mark1>son</mark1><br>
Who spoke, although he call'd back names he <mark3>knew;</mark3><br>
For he had had sure tidings that the <mark4>babe,</mark4><br>
Which was in Ader-baijan born to <mark4>him,</mark4><br>
Had been a puny <mark4>girl</mark4>, no boy at <mark1>all--</mark1><br>
So that sad mother sent him word, for <mark1>fear</mark1><br>
Rustum should seek the boy, to train in <mark1>arms.</mark1><br>
And so he deem'd that either Sohrab <mark1>took,</mark1><br>
By a false boast, the style of Rustum's <mark1>son;</mark1><br>
Or that men gave it <mark4>him</mark4>, to swell his <mark1>fame.</mark1><br>
So deem'd he; yet he listen'd, plunged in <mark1>thought</mark1><br>
And his soul set to grief, as the vast <mark4>tide</mark4><br>
Of the bright rocking Ocean sets to <mark1>shore</mark1><br>
At the full moon; tears gather'd in his <mark1>eyes;</mark1><br>
For he remember'd his own early <mark1>youth,</mark1><br>
And all its bounding rapture; as, at <mark1>dawn,</mark1><br>
The shepherd from his mountain-lodge <mark1>descries</mark1><br>
A far, bright city, smitten by the <mark1>sun,</mark1><br>
Through many rolling clouds--so Rustum <mark1>saw</mark1><br>
His youth; saw Sohrab's mother, in her <mark4>bloom;</mark4><br>
And that old king, her father, who loved <mark4>well</mark4><br>
His wandering guest, and gave him his fair <mark4>child</mark4><br>
With joy; and all the pleasant life they <mark4>led,</mark4><br>
They three, in that long-distant <mark4>summer-time--</mark4><br>
The castle, and the dewy woods, and <mark4>hunt</mark4><br>
And hound, and morn on those delightful <mark4>hills</mark4><br>
In Ader-baijan. And he saw that <mark1>Youth,</mark1><br>
Of age and looks to be his own dear <mark1>son,</mark1><br>
Piteous and lovely, lying on the <mark1>sand,</mark1><br>
Like some rich hyacinth which by the <mark4>scythe</mark4><br>
Of an unskilful gardener has been <mark4>cut,</mark4><br>
Mowing the garden grass-plots near its <mark1>bed,</mark1><br>
And lies, a fragrant tower of purple <mark1>bloom,</mark1><br>
On the mown, dying grass--so Sohrab <mark1>lay,</mark1><br>
Lovely in death, upon the common <mark1>sand.</mark1><br>
And Rustum gazed on him with grief, and <mark1>said:--</mark1><br>
<br>
"O Sohrab, thou indeed art such a <mark1>son</mark1><br>
Whom Rustum, wert thou his, might well have <mark1>loved!</mark1><br>
Yet here thou errest, Sohrab, or else <mark1>men</mark1><br>
Have told thee false--thou art not Rustum's <mark1>son.</mark1><br>
For Rustum had no son; one child he <mark4>had--</mark4><br>
But one--a girl; who with her mother <mark1>now</mark1><br>
Plies some light female task, nor dreams of <mark1>us--</mark1><br>
Of us she dreams not, nor of wounds, nor <mark1>war."</mark1><br>
<br>
But Sohrab answer'd him in wrath: for <mark1>now</mark1><br>
The anguish of the deep-fix'd spear grew <mark4>fierce,</mark4><br>
And he desired to draw forth the <mark1>steel,</mark1><br>
And let the blood flow free, and so to <mark1>die--</mark1><br>
But first he would convince his stubborn <mark1>foe;</mark1><br>
And, rising sternly on one arm, he <mark1>said:--</mark1><br>
<br>
"Man, who art thou who dost deny my <mark1>words?</mark1><br>
Truth sits upon the lips of dying <mark1>men,</mark1><br>
And falsehood, while I lived, was far from <mark4>mine.</mark4><br>
I tell thee, prick'd upon this arm I <mark4>bear</mark4><br>
That seal which Rustum to my mother <mark4>gave,</mark4><br>
That she might prick it on the babe she <mark4>bore."</mark4><br>
<br>
He spoke; and all the blood left Rustum's <mark4>cheeks,</mark4><br>
And his knees totter'd, and he smote his <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
Against his breast, his heavy mailed <mark1>hand,</mark1><br>
That the hard iron corslet clank'd <mark1>aloud;</mark1><br>
And to his heart he press'd the other <mark1>hand,</mark1><br>
And in a hollow voice he spake, and <mark1>said:--</mark1><br>
<br>
"Sohrab, that were a proof which could not <mark1>lie!</mark1><br>
If thou show this, then art thou Rustum's <mark1>son."</mark1><br>
<br>
Then, with weak hasty fingers, Sohrab <mark4>loosed</mark4><br>
His belt, and near the shoulder bared his <mark1>arm,</mark1><br>
And show'd a sign in faint vermilion <mark4>points</mark4><br>
Prick'd; as a cunning <mark4>workman</mark4>, in <mark4>Pekin,</mark4><br>
Pricks with vermilion some clear porcelain <mark4>vase,</mark4><br>
An emperor's gift--at early morn he <mark4>paints,</mark4><br>
And all day long, and, when night comes, the <mark4>lamp</mark4><br>
Lights up his studious forehead and thin <mark1>hands--</mark1><br>
So delicately prick'd the sign <mark1>appear'd</mark1><br>
On Sohrab's arm, the sign of Rustum's <mark3>seal.</mark3><br>
It was that griffin, which of old rear'd <mark1>Zal,</mark1><br>
Rustum's great father, whom they left to <mark1>die,</mark1><br>
A helpless babe, among the <mark4>mountain-rocks;</mark4><br>
Him that kind creature found, and rear'd, and <mark1>loved--</mark1><br>
Then Rustum took it for his glorious <mark4>sign.</mark4><br>
And Sohrab bared that image on his <mark1>arm,</mark1><br>
And himself scann'd it long with mournful <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
And then he touch'd it with his hand and <mark1>said:--</mark1><br>
<br>
"How say'st thou? Is that sign the proper <mark1>sign</mark1><br>
Of Rustum's son, or of some other <mark1>man's?"</mark1><br>
<br>
He spoke; but Rustum <mark4>gazed</mark4>, and gazed, and <mark1>stood</mark1><br>
Speechless; and then he utter'd one sharp <mark1>cry:</mark1><br>
O boy--thy father!--and his voice choked <mark1>there.</mark1><br>
And then a dark cloud pass'd before his <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
And his head swam, and he sank down to <mark1>earth.</mark1><br>
But Sohrab crawl'd to where he lay, and <mark1>cast</mark1><br>
His arms about his neck, and kiss'd his <mark4>lips,</mark4><br>
And with fond faltering fingers stroked his <mark1>cheeks,</mark1><br>
Trying to call him back to <mark1>life</mark1>, and <mark4>life</mark4><br>
Came back to Rustum, and he oped his <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
And they stood wide with horror; and he <mark4>seized</mark4><br>
In both his hands the dust which lay <mark1>around,</mark1><br>
And threw it on his head, and smirch'd his <mark3>hair,--</mark3><br>
His hair, and face, and beard, and glittering <mark1>arms;</mark1><br>
And strong convulsive groanings shook his <mark4>breast,</mark4><br>
And his sobs choked him; and he clutch'd his <mark1>sword,</mark1><br>
To draw <mark4>it</mark4>, and for ever let life <mark4>out.</mark4><br>
But Sohrab saw his thoughts, and held his <mark1>hands</mark1><br>
And with a soothing voice he spake, and <mark1>said:--</mark1><br>
<br>
"Father, forbear! for I but meet <mark1>to-day</mark1><br>
The doom which at my birth was written <mark1>down</mark1><br>
In Heaven, and thou art Heaven's unconscious <mark1>hand.</mark1><br>
Surely my heart cried out that it was <mark1>thou,</mark1><br>
When first I saw thee; and thy heart spoke <mark1>too,</mark1><br>
I know it! but fate trod those promptings <mark1>down</mark1><br>
Under its iron heel; fate, fate <mark4>engaged</mark4><br>
The strife, and hurl'd me on my father's <mark1>spear.</mark1><br>
But let us speak no more of this! I <mark1>find</mark1><br>
My father; let me feel that I have <mark1>found!</mark1><br>
Come, sit beside me on this sand, and <mark4>take</mark4><br>
My head betwixt thy hands, and kiss my <mark1>cheeks,</mark1><br>
And wash them with thy tears, and say: My <mark1>son!</mark1><br>
Quick! quick! for number'd are my sands of <mark1>life,</mark1><br>
And swift; for like the lightning to this <mark1>field</mark1><br>
I came, and like the wind I go <mark1>away--</mark1><br>
Sudden, and swift, and like a passing <mark4>wind.</mark4><br>
But it was writ in Heaven that this should <mark1>be."</mark1><br>
<br>
So said he, and his voice released the <mark1>heart</mark1><br>
Of Rustum, and his tears broke forth; he <mark1>cast</mark1><br>
His arms round his son's neck, and wept <mark1>aloud,</mark1><br>
And kiss'd him. And awe fell on both the <mark1>hosts,</mark1><br>
When they saw Rustum's grief; and Ruksh, the <mark1>horse,</mark1><br>
With his head bowing to the ground and <mark4>mane</mark4><br>
Sweeping the dust, came near, and in mute <mark3>woe</mark3><br>
First to the one then to the other <mark4>moved</mark4><br>
His head, as if enquiring what their <mark4>grief</mark4><br>
Might mean; and from his dark, compassionate <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
The big warm tears roll'd down, and caked the <mark1>sand.</mark1><br>
But Rustum chid him with stern voice, and <mark1>said:--</mark1><br>
<br>
"Ruksh, now thou grievest; but, O Ruksh, thy <mark1>feet</mark1><br>
Should first have rotted on their nimble <mark4>joints,</mark4><br>
Or ere they brought thy master to this <mark1>field!"</mark1><br>
<br>
But Sohrab look'd upon the horse and <mark1>said;--</mark1><br>
"Is this, then, Ruksh? How often, in past <mark4>days</mark4><br>
My mother told me of thee, thou brave <mark4>steed,</mark4><br>
My terrible father's terrible horse! and <mark1>said,</mark1><br>
That I should one day find thy lord and <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
Come, let me lay my hand upon thy <mark1>mane!</mark1><br>
O Ruksh, thou art more fortunate than <mark1>I;</mark1><br>
For thou has gone where I shall never <mark1>go,</mark1><br>
And snuff'd the breezes of my father's <mark1>home.</mark1><br>
And thou hast trod the sands of <mark1>Seistan,</mark1><br>
And seen the River of Helmund, and the <mark3>Lake</mark3><br>
Of Zirrah; and the aged Zal <mark4>himself</mark4><br>
Has often stroked thy neck, and given thee <mark1>food,</mark1><br>
Corn in a golden platter soak'd with <mark1>wine,</mark1><br>
And said; O Ruksh! bear Rustrum well!--but <mark1>I</mark1><br>
Have never known my grandsire's furrow'd <mark4>face,</mark4><br>
Nor seen his lofty house in <mark1>Seistan,</mark1><br>
Nor slaked my thirst at the clear Helmund <mark1>stream;</mark1><br>
But lodged among my father's foes, and <mark1>seen</mark1><br>
Afrasiab's cities only, Samarcand,<br>
Bokhara, and lone Khiva in the <mark1>waste,</mark1><br>
And the black Toorkmun tents; and only <mark4>drunk</mark4><br>
The desert rivers, Moorghab and Tejend,<br>
Kohik, and where the Kalmuks feed their <mark4>sheep,</mark4><br>
The northern Sir; and this great Oxus <mark1>stream,</mark1><br>
The yellow Oxus, by whose brink I <mark1>die."</mark1><br>
<br>
       Then, with a heavy groan, Rustum bewail'd:--<br>
"Oh, that its waves were flowing over <mark1>me!</mark1><br>
Oh, that I saw its grains of yellow <mark4>silt</mark4><br>
Roll, tumbling in the current o'er my <mark1>head!"</mark1><br>
<br>
But, with a grave mild voice, Sohrab <mark1>replied:--</mark1><br>
"Desire not that, my father! thou must <mark4>live.</mark4><br>
For some are born to do great deeds, and <mark1>live,</mark1><br>
As some are born to be obscured, and <mark1>die.</mark1><br>
Do thou the deeds I die too young to <mark3>do,</mark3><br>
And reap a second glory in thine <mark1>age;</mark1><br>
Thou art my father, and thy gain is <mark1>mine.</mark1><br>
But come! thou seest this great host of <mark1>men</mark1><br>
Which follow me; I pray thee, slay not <mark4>these!</mark4><br>
Let me entreat for them; what have they <mark1>done?</mark1><br>
They follow'd me, my hope, my fame, my <mark4>star.</mark4><br>
Let them all cross the Oxus back in <mark1>peace.</mark1><br>
But me thou must bear hence, not send with <mark4>them,</mark4><br>
But carry me with thee to <mark1>Seistan,</mark1><br>
And place me on a bed, and mourn for <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Thou, and the snow-hair'd Zal, and all thy <mark1>friends.</mark1><br>
And thou must lay me in that lovely <mark1>earth,</mark1><br>
And heap a stately mound above my <mark1>bones,</mark1><br>
And plant a far-seen pillar over <mark1>all.</mark1><br>
That so the passing horseman on the <mark1>waste</mark1><br>
May see my tomb a great way off, and <mark1>cry:</mark1><br>
Sohrab, the mighty Rustum's son, lies <mark1>there,</mark1><br>
Whom his great father did in ignorance <mark1>kill!</mark1><br>
And I be not forgotten in my <mark1>grave."</mark1><br>
<br>
And, with a mournful voice, Rustum <mark1>replied:--</mark1><br>
"Fear not! as thou hast said, Sohrab, my <mark1>son,</mark1><br>
So shall it be; for I will burn my <mark1>tents,</mark1><br>
And quit the host, and bear thee hence with <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
And carry thee away to <mark1>Seistan,</mark1><br>
And place thee on a bed, and mourn for <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
With the snow-headed Zal, and all my <mark1>friends.</mark1><br>
And I will lay thee in the lovely <mark1>earth,</mark1><br>
And heap a stately mound above thy <mark1>bones,</mark1><br>
And plant a far-seen pillar over <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
And men shall not forget thee in thy <mark1>grave.</mark1><br>
And I will spare thy host; yea, let them <mark1>go!</mark1><br>
Let them all cross the Oxus back in <mark1>peace!</mark1><br>
What should I do with slaying any <mark1>more?</mark1><br>
For would that all whom I have ever <mark1>slain</mark1><br>
Might be once more alive; my bitterest <mark1>foes,</mark1><br>
And they who were call'd champions in their <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
And through whose death I won that fame I <mark1>have--</mark1><br>
And I were nothing but a common <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
A poor, mean soldier, and without <mark4>renown,</mark4><br>
So thou mightest live too, my <mark1>son</mark1>, my <mark1>son!</mark1><br>
Or rather would that I, even I <mark1>myself,</mark1><br>
Might now be lying on this bloody <mark1>sand,</mark1><br>
Near death, and by an ignorant stroke of <mark1>thine,</mark1><br>
Not thou of mine! and I might die, not <mark1>thou;</mark1><br>
And I, not thou, be borne to <mark1>Seistan;</mark1><br>
And Zal might weep above my grave, not <mark1>thine;</mark1><br>
And say: O son, I weep thee not too <mark3>sore,</mark3><br>
For willingly, I know, thou met'st thine <mark4>end!</mark4><br>
But now in blood and battles was my <mark1>youth,</mark1><br>
And full of blood and battles is my <mark1>age,</mark1><br>
And I shall never end this life of <mark4>blood."</mark4><br>
<br>
Then, at the point of death, Sohrab <mark1>replied:--</mark1><br>
"A life of blood indeed, thou dreadful <mark1>man!</mark1><br>
But thou shalt yet have peace; only not <mark1>now,</mark1><br>
Not yet! but thou shalt have it on that <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
When thou shalt sail in a high-masted <mark4>ship,</mark4><br>
Thou and the other peers of Kai <mark1>Khosroo,</mark1><br>
Returning home over the salt blue <mark1>sea,</mark1><br>
From laying thy dear master in his <mark1>grave."</mark1><br>
<br>
And Rustum gazed in Sohrab's face, and <mark1>said:--</mark1><br>
"Soon be that day, my son, and deep that <mark1>sea!</mark1><br>
Till then, if fate so wills, let me <mark4>endure."</mark4><br>
<br>
He spoke; and Sohrab smiled on him, and <mark1>took</mark1><br>
The spear, and drew it from his <mark4>side</mark4>, and <mark4>eased</mark4><br>
His wound's imperious anguish; but the <mark1>blood</mark1><br>
Came welling from the open gash, and <mark1>life</mark1><br>
Flow'd with the stream;--all down his cold white <mark1>side</mark1><br>
The crimson torrent ran, dim now and <mark1>soil'd,</mark1><br>
Like the soil'd tissue of white <mark4>violets</mark4><br>
Left, freshly gather'd, on their native <mark4>bank,</mark4><br>
By children whom their nurses call with <mark3>haste</mark3><br>
Indoors from the sun's eye; his head droop'd <mark3>low,</mark3><br>
His limbs grew slack; motionless, white, he <mark1>lay--</mark1><br>
White, with eyes closed; only when heavy <mark4>gasps,</mark4><br>
Deep heavy gasps quivering through all his <mark4>frame,</mark4><br>
Convulsed him back to life, he open'd <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
And fix'd them feebly on his father's <mark1>face;</mark1><br>
Till now all strength was <mark4>ebb'd</mark4>, and from his <mark4>limbs</mark4><br>
Unwillingly the spirit fled <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
Regretting the warm mansion which it <mark1>left,</mark1><br>
And youth, and bloom, and this delightful <mark1>world.</mark1><br>
<br>
So, on the bloody <mark4>sand</mark4>, Sohrab lay <mark4>dead;</mark4><br>
And the great Rustum drew his horseman's <mark4>cloak</mark4><br>
Down o'er his face, and sate by his dead <mark1>son.</mark1><br>
As those black granite pillars, once high-rear'd<br>
By Jemshid in Persepolis, to <mark1>bear</mark1><br>
His <mark4>house</mark4>, now 'mid their broken flights of <mark4>steps</mark4><br>
Lie prone, enormous, down the mountain <mark1>side--</mark1><br>
So in the sand lay Rustum by his <mark1>son.</mark1><br>
<br>
And night came down over the solemn <mark1>waste,</mark1><br>
And the two gazing hosts, and that sole <mark1>pair,</mark1><br>
And darken'd all; and a cold fog, with <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
Crept from the Oxus. Soon a hum <mark4>arose,</mark4><br>
As of a great assembly loosed, and <mark4>fires</mark4><br>
Began to twinkle through the fog; for <mark1>now</mark1><br>
Both armies moved to camp, and took their <mark4>meal;</mark4><br>
The Persians took it on the open <mark1>sands</mark1><br>
Southward, the Tartars by the river <mark4>marge;</mark4><br>
And Rustum and his son were left <mark1>alone.</mark1><br>
<br>
But the majestic river floated <mark1>on,</mark1><br>
Out of the mist and hum of that low <mark1>land,</mark1><br>
Into the frosty starlight, and there <mark1>moved,</mark1><br>
Rejoicing, through the hush'd Chorasmian <mark1>waste,</mark1><br>
Under the solitary moon;--he <mark4>flow'd</mark4><br>
Right for the polar star, past Orgunje,<br>
Brimming, and bright, and large; then sands <mark4>begin</mark4><br>
To hem his watery march, and dam his <mark4>streams,</mark4><br>
And split his currents; that for many a <mark4>league</mark4><br>
The shorn and parcell'd Oxus strains <mark3>along</mark3><br>
Through beds of sand and matted rushy <mark4>isles--</mark4><br>
Oxus, forgetting the bright speed he <mark1>had</mark1><br>
In his high mountain-cradle in <mark1>Pamere,</mark1><br>
A foil'd circuitous wanderer--till at <mark1>last</mark1><br>
The long'd-for dash of waves is <mark4>heard</mark4>, and <mark4>wide</mark4><br>
His luminous home of waters opens, <mark4>bright</mark4><br>
And tranquil, from whose floor the new-bathed <mark4>stars</mark4><br>
Emerge, and shine upon the Aral <mark1>Sea.</mark1><br>
