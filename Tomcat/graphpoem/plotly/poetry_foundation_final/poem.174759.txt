Title : Telling the Bees <br>
Author : John Greenleaf Whittier <br><br>

Here is the place; right over the <mark3>hill</mark3><br>
Runs the path I <mark3>took;</mark3><br>
You can see the gap in the old wall <mark3>still,</mark3><br>
And the stepping-stones in the shallow <mark3>brook.</mark3><br>
<br>
There is the house, with the gate <mark3>red-barred,</mark3><br>
And the poplars <mark4>tall;</mark4><br>
And the barn's brown length, and the <mark3>cattle-yard,</mark3><br>
And the white horns tossing above the <mark3>wall.</mark3><br>
<br>
There are the beehives ranged in the <mark4>sun;</mark4><br>
And down by the <mark4>brink</mark4><br>
Of the brook are her poor flowers, <mark5>weed-o'errun,</mark5><br>
Pansy and daffodil, rose and <mark3>pink.</mark3><br>
<br>
A year has gone, as the tortoise <mark3>goes,</mark3><br>
Heavy and <mark3>slow;</mark3><br>
And the same rose <mark3>blows</mark3>, and the same sun <mark3>glows,</mark3><br>
And the same brook sings of a year <mark3>ago.</mark3><br>
<br>
There 's the same sweet clover-smell in the <mark4>breeze;</mark4><br>
And the June sun <mark4>warm</mark4><br>
Tangles his wings of fire in the <mark3>trees,</mark3><br>
Setting, as then, over Fernside <mark4>farm.</mark4><br>
<br>
I mind me how with a lover's <mark3>care</mark3><br>
From my Sunday <mark3>coat</mark3><br>
I brushed off the burrs, and smoothed my <mark3>hair,</mark3><br>
And cooled at the brookside my brow and <mark3>throat.</mark3><br>
<br>
Since we parted, a month had <mark4>passed,--</mark4><br>
To love, a <mark4>year;</mark4><br>
Down through the beeches I looked at <mark3>last</mark3><br>
On the little red gate and the well-sweep <mark3>near.</mark3><br>
<br>
I can see it all now,--the slantwise <mark4>rain</mark4><br>
Of light through the <mark4>leaves,</mark4><br>
The sundown's blaze on her <mark4>window-pane,</mark4><br>
The bloom of her roses under the <mark3>eaves.</mark3><br>
<br>
Just the same as a month <mark4>before,--</mark4><br>
The house and the <mark1>trees,</mark1><br>
The barn's brown gable, the vine by the <mark3>door,--</mark3><br>
Nothing changed but the hives of <mark3>bees.</mark3><br>
<br>
Before them, under the garden <mark1>wall,</mark1><br>
Forward and <mark4>back,</mark4><br>
Went drearily singing the chore-girl <mark3>small,</mark3><br>
Draping each hive with a shred of <mark3>black.</mark3><br>
<br>
Trembling, I listened: the summer <mark1>sun</mark1><br>
Had the chill of <mark3>snow;</mark3><br>
For I knew she was telling the bees of <mark3>one</mark3><br>
Gone on the journey we all must <mark3>go!</mark3><br>
<br>
Then I said to myself, "My Mary <mark5>weeps</mark5><br>
For the dead <mark3>to-day:</mark3><br>
Haply her blind old grandsire <mark3>sleeps</mark3><br>
The fret and the pain of his age <mark3>away."</mark3><br>
<br>
But her dog whined low; on the doorway <mark4>sill,</mark4><br>
With his cane to his <mark4>chin,</mark4><br>
The old man sat; and the chore-girl <mark1>still</mark1><br>
Sung to the bees stealing out and <mark3>in.</mark3><br>
<br>
And the song she was singing ever <mark4>since</mark4><br>
In my ear sounds <mark4>on:--</mark4><br>
"Stay at home, pretty bees, fly not <mark4>hence!</mark4><br>
Mistress Mary is dead and <mark3>gone!"</mark3><br>
