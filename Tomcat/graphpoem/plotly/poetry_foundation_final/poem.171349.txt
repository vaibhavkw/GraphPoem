Title : A Letter in October <br>
Author : Ted Kooser <br><br>

Dawn comes later and later now,   <br>
and I, who only a month ago <br>
could sit with coffee every <mark4>morning</mark4><br>
watching the light walk down the hill   <br>
to the edge of the pond and <mark3>place</mark3><br>
a doe there, shyly <mark4>drinking,</mark4><br>
<br>
then see the light step out <mark4>upon</mark4><br>
the water, sowing reflections   <br>
to either side--a <mark4>garden</mark4><br>
of trees that grew as if by <mark4>magic--</mark4><br>
now see no more than my <mark3>face,</mark3><br>
mirrored by darkness, pale and <mark4>odd,</mark4><br>
<br>
startled by time. While I <mark4>slept,</mark4><br>
night in its thick winter <mark4>jacket</mark4><br>
bridled the doe with a <mark4>twist</mark4><br>
of wet leaves and led her away, <br>
then brought its black horse with <mark4>harness</mark4><br>
that creaked like a cricket, and <mark4>turned</mark4><br>
<br>
the water garden under. I <mark4>woke,</mark4><br>
and at the waiting window <mark4>found</mark4><br>
the curtains open to my open <mark1>face;</mark1><br>
beyond me, darkness. And I, <br>
who only wished to keep looking <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
must now keep looking <mark4>in.</mark4><br>
