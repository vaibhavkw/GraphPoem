Title : Carpentry <br>
Author : Carl Dennis <br><br>

Carpenters whose wives have run <mark4>off</mark4><br>
Are sometimes discovered weeping on the <mark1>job.</mark1><br>
But even then they don't complain of their <mark4>work.</mark4><br>
<br>
Whitman's father was a carpenter. <br>
He was so happy hammering <mark4>houses</mark4><br>
That he jumped with a shout from the roof beam   <br>
And rolled with a yawp in the <mark4>timothy.</mark4><br>
This led his son to conclude <mark4>wrongly</mark4><br>
That all workmen are <mark4>singers.</mark4><br>
<br>
Whitman's father was <mark4>weak.</mark4><br>
He had trouble holding a <mark1>job.</mark1><br>
He hoped that the house he was working <mark4>on</mark4><br>
Would be lived in by a man more <mark4>steady</mark4><br>
Than he was, who would earn his sleep,   <br>
Dreaming easy under a sound <mark4>roof</mark4><br>
With no rain in his face. <br>
<br>
Of course, there are bad carpenters everywhere.   <br>
They don't care if the walls don't <mark4>meet.</mark4><br>
"After all," they argue, <br>
"We're not building <mark4>airplanes."</mark4><br>
But Whitman's father measured his <mark4>nails.</mark4><br>
Many mornings, clacking his <mark4>plane,</mark4><br>
He crooned a song to the <mark4>corners,</mark4><br>
Urging them on to a snug <mark4>fit.</mark4><br>
No needles of heat will escape through a <mark4>crack</mark4><br>
If he can help <mark4>it</mark4>, no threads of <mark4>light.</mark4><br>
