Title : Carrion Comfort <br>
Author : Gerard Manley Hopkins <br><br>

Not, I'll not, carrion comfort, Despair, not feast on <mark3>thee;</mark3><br>
Not untwist -- slack they may be -- these last strands of <mark3>man</mark3><br>
In me or, most weary, cry I can no more. I <mark3>can;</mark3><br>
Can something, hope, wish day come, not choose not to <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
But ah, but O thou terrible, why wouldst thou rude on <mark3>me</mark3><br>
Thy wring-world right foot rock? lay a lionlimb against me? <mark3>scan</mark3><br>
With darksome devouring eyes my bruised bones? and <mark3>fan,</mark3><br>
O in turns of tempest, me heaped there; me frantic to avoid thee and <mark3>flee?</mark3><br>
<br>
Why? That my chaff might fly; my grain lie, sheer and <mark3>clear.</mark3><br>
Nay in all that toil, that coil, since (seems) I kissed the <mark3>rod,</mark3><br>
Hand rather, my heart lo! lapped strength, stole joy, would laugh, <mark3>cheer.</mark3><br>
Cheer whom though? the hero whose heaven-handling flung me, foot <mark3>trod</mark3><br>
Me? or me that fought him? O which one? is it each one? That night, that <mark3>year</mark3><br>
Of now done darkness I wretch lay wrestling with (my God!) my <mark3>God.</mark3><br>
