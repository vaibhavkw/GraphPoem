Title : After the Last Bulletins <br>
Author : Richard Wilbur <br><br>

After the last bulletins the windows <mark4>darken</mark4><br>
And the whole city founders readily and <mark3>deep,</mark3><br>
Sliding on all its <mark4>pillows</mark4><br>
To the thronged Atlantis of personal <mark3>sleep,</mark3><br>
<br>
And the wind <mark4>rises</mark4>, The wind rises and <mark4>bowls</mark4><br>
The day's litter of news in the alleys. <mark3>Trash</mark3><br>
Tears itself on the <mark4>railings,</mark4><br>
Soars and falls with a soft <mark3>crash,</mark3><br>
<br>
Tumbles and soars again. Unruly <mark4>flights</mark4><br>
Scamper the park, and taking a statue for <mark3>dead</mark3><br>
Strike at the positive <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
Batter and flap the stolid <mark3>head</mark3><br>
<br>
And scratch the noble name. In empty <mark4>lots</mark4><br>
Our journals spiral in a fierce noyade   <br>
Of all we thought to think, <br>
Or caught in corners cramp and <mark4>wad</mark4><br>
<br>
And twist our words. And some from gutters flail   <br>
Their tatters at the tired patrolman's <mark3>feet,</mark3><br>
Like all that fisted snow <br>
That cried beside his long <mark3>retreat</mark3><br>
<br>
Damn you! damn you! to the emperor's horse's <mark4>heels.</mark4><br>
Oh none too soon through the air white and <mark3>dry</mark3><br>
Will the clear announcer's <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
Beat like a dove, and you and <mark3>I</mark3><br>
<br>
From the heart's anarch and responsible <mark4>town</mark4><br>
Return by subway-mouth to life <mark4>again,</mark4><br>
Bearing the morning <mark4>papers,</mark4><br>
And cross the park where saintlike <mark3>men,</mark3><br>
<br>
White and absorbed, with stick and bag remove   <br>
The litter of the night, and footsteps <mark4>rouse</mark4><br>
With confident morning <mark4>sound</mark4><br>
The songbirds in the public <mark3>boughs.</mark3><br>
