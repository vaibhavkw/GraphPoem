Title : It is a Beauteous Evening, Calm and Free <br>
Author : William Wordsworth <br><br>

It is a beauteous evening, calm and <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
The holy time is quiet as a <mark3>Nun</mark3><br>
Breathless with <mark4>adoration</mark4>, the broad <mark3>sun</mark3><br>
Is sinking down in its tranquility; <br>
The gentleness of heaven broods o'er the <mark3>Sea;</mark3><br>
Listen! the mighty Being is <mark3>awake,</mark3><br>
And doth with his eternal motion <mark3>make</mark3><br>
A sound like thunder--everlastingly. <br>
Dear child! dear Girl! that walkest with me <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
If thou appear untouched by solemn <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
Thy nature is not therefore less <mark4>divine:</mark4><br>
Thou liest in Abraham's bosom all the <mark4>year;</mark4><br>
And worshipp'st at the Temple's inner <mark3>shrine,</mark3><br>
God being with thee when we know it <mark4>not.</mark4><br>
