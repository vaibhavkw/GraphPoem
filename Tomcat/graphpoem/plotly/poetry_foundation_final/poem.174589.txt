Title : The Eagle <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

He clasps the crag with crooked <mark3>hands;</mark3><br>
Close to the sun in lonely <mark3>lands,</mark3><br>
Ring'd with the azure world, he <mark3>stands.</mark3><br>
<br>
The wrinkled sea beneath him <mark4>crawls;</mark4><br>
He watches from his mountain <mark3>walls,</mark3><br>
And like a thunderbolt he <mark3>falls.</mark3><br>
