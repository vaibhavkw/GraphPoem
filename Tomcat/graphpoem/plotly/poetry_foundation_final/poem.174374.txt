Title : Sonnet 129: Th'expense of spirit in a waste of shame <br>
Author : William Shakespeare <br><br>

Th' expense of spirit in a waste of <mark3>shame</mark3><br>
Is lust in action; and till action, <mark3>lust</mark3><br>
Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody, full of <mark3>blame,</mark3><br>
Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to <mark3>trust,</mark3><br>
Enjoyed no sooner but despised <mark4>straight,</mark4><br>
Past reason hunted; <mark4>and</mark4>, no sooner <mark4>had</mark4><br>
Past reason hated as a swallowed <mark3>bait</mark3><br>
On purpose laid to make the taker <mark3>mad;</mark3><br>
Mad in pursuit and in possession <mark3>so,</mark3><br>
Had, having, and in quest to have, <mark4>extreme;</mark4><br>
A bliss in proof and proved, a very <mark3>woe;</mark3><br>
Before, a joy proposed; behind, a <mark3>dream.</mark3><br>
All this the world well knows; yet none knows <mark3>well</mark3><br>
To shun the heaven that leads men to this <mark3>hell.</mark3><br>
