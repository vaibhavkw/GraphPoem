Title : Astrophil and Stella 33: I might!--unhappy word--O me, I might <br>
Author : Sir Philip Sidney <br><br>

I might!--unhappy word--O me, I <mark3>might,</mark3><br>
And then would not, or could not, see my <mark3>bliss;</mark3><br>
Till now wrapt in a most infernal <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
I find how heav'nly day, wretch! I did <mark3>miss.</mark3><br>
Heart, rend thyself, thou dost thyself but <mark3>right;</mark3><br>
No lovely Paris made thy Helen <mark3>his,</mark3><br>
No force, no fraud robb'd thee of thy <mark3>delight,</mark3><br>
Nor Fortune of thy fortune author <mark3>is;</mark3><br>
But to myself myself did give the <mark3>blow,</mark3><br>
While too much wit, forsooth, so troubled <mark3>me</mark3><br>
That I respects for both our sakes must <mark3>show:</mark3><br>
And yet could not by rising morn <mark3>foresee</mark3><br>
How fair a day was near: O punish'd <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
That I had been more foolish,--or more <mark3>wise!</mark3><br>
