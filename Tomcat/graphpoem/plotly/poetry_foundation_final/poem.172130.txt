Title : "Teach Us to Number Our Days" <br>
Author : Rita Dove <br><br>

In the old neighborhood, each funeral parlor   <br>
is more elaborate than the <mark4>last.</mark4><br>
The alleys smell of cops, pistols bumping their <mark4>thighs,</mark4><br>
each chamber steeled with a slim blue <mark4>bullet.</mark4><br>
<br>
Low-rent balconies stacked to the <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
A boy plays tic-tac-toe on a <mark4>moon</mark4><br>
crossed by TV antennae, <mark4>dreams</mark4><br>
<br>
he has swallowed a blue <mark4>bean.</mark4><br>
It takes root in his gut, sprouts <br>
and twines upward, the vines curling   <br>
around the sockets and locking them <mark4>shut.</mark4><br>
<br>
And this <mark3>sky</mark3>, knotting like a dark <mark3>tie?</mark3><br>
The patroller, disinterested, holds all the <mark4>beans.</mark4><br>
<br>
August. The mums nod past, each a prickly heart on a sleeve.<br>
