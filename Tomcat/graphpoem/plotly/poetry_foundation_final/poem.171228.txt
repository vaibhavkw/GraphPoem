Title : Everything that Acts Is Actual <br>
Author : Denise Levertov <br><br>

From the tawny light <br>
from the rainy <mark4>nights</mark4><br>
from the imagination <mark4>finding</mark4><br>
itself and more than itself <br>
alone and more than <mark4>alone</mark4><br>
at the bottom of the well where the moon <mark5>lives,</mark5><br>
can you pull me <br>
<br>
into December? a <mark4>lowland</mark4><br>
of <mark1>space</mark1>, perception of <mark4>space</mark4><br>
towering of shadows of clouds blown <mark4>upon</mark4><br>
clouds over <br>
new <mark4>ground</mark4>, new <mark4>made</mark4><br>
under heavy December footsteps? the <mark4>only</mark4><br>
way to <mark5>live?</mark5><br>
<br>
The flawed <mark4>moon</mark4><br>
acts on the truth, and <mark4>makes</mark4><br>
an autumn of <mark4>tentative</mark4><br>
<br>
You lived, but somewhere <mark4>else,</mark4><br>
your presence touched others, ring upon <mark4>ring,</mark4><br>
and changed. Did you think   <br>
I would not change? <br>
<br>
The black <mark1>moon</mark1><br>
turns away, its work done. A <mark4>tenderness,</mark4><br>
unspoken autumn.   <br>
We are faithful <br>
only to the imagination. What <mark4>the</mark4><br>
<br>
as beauty must be truth. What holds you <br>
to what you see of me <mark4>is</mark4><br>
that grasp <mark1>alone.</mark1><br>
