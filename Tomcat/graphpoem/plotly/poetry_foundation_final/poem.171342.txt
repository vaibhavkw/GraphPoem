Title : In the Basement of the Goodwill Store <br>
Author : Ted Kooser <br><br>

In musty light, in the thin brown <mark3>air</mark3><br>
of damp <mark4>carpet</mark4>, doll heads and <mark4>rust,</mark4><br>
beneath long rows of sharp footfalls   <br>
like nails in a lid, an old man <mark4>stands</mark4><br>
trying on glasses, lifting each <mark3>pair</mark3><br>
from the box like a glittering fish   <br>
and holding it up to the <mark4>light</mark4><br>
of a dirty bulb. Near him, a heap   <br>
of enameled pans as white as <mark4>skulls</mark4><br>
looms in the catacomb <mark4>shadows,</mark4><br>
and old toilets with dry red <mark4>throats</mark4><br>
cough up bouquets of curtain <mark4>rods.</mark4><br>
<br>
You've seen him somewhere <mark4>before.</mark4><br>
He's wearing the green leisure <mark4>suit</mark4><br>
you threw out with the garbage,   <br>
and the Christmas tie you hated,   <br>
and the ventilated wingtip <mark4>shoes</mark4><br>
you found in your father's <mark4>closet</mark4><br>
and wore as a joke. And the <mark4>glasses</mark4><br>
which finally fit him, through which   <br>
he looks to see you looking back-- <br>
two mirrors which flash and <mark4>glance--</mark4><br>
are those through which one day <br>
you too will look down over the <mark4>years,</mark4><br>
when you have grown old and thin   <br>
and no longer <mark4>particular,</mark4><br>
and the things you once <mark4>thought</mark4><br>
you were rid of <mark4>forever</mark4><br>
have taken you back in their <mark4>arms.</mark4><br>
