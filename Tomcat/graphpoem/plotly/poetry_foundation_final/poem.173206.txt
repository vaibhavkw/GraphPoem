Title : The Skylark <br>
Author : John Clare <br><br>

The rolls and harrows lie at rest <mark3>beside</mark3><br>
The battered <mark4>road</mark4>, and spreading far and <mark3>wide</mark3><br>
Above the russet clods, the corn is <mark3>seen</mark3><br>
Sprouting its spiry points of tender <mark3>green,</mark3><br>
Where squats the hare, to terrors wide <mark3>awake,</mark3><br>
Like some brown clod the harrows failed to <mark3>break.</mark3><br>
Opening their golden caskets to the <mark4>sun,</mark4><br>
The buttercups make schoolboys eager <mark3>run,</mark3><br>
To see who shall be first to pluck the <mark3>prize?</mark3><br>
Up from their hurry, see, the skylark <mark3>flies,</mark3><br>
And o'er her half-formed nest, with happy <mark4>wings</mark4><br>
Winnows the air, till in the cloud she <mark3>sings,</mark3><br>
Then hangs a dust-spot in the sunny <mark4>skies,</mark4><br>
And drops, and drops, till in her nest she <mark3>lies,</mark3><br>
Which they unheeded passed?not dreaming <mark4>then</mark4><br>
That birds which flew so high would drop agen<br>
To nests upon the ground, which <mark4>anything</mark4><br>
May come at to destroy. Had they the <mark4>wing</mark4><br>
Like such a <mark4>bird</mark4>, themselves would be too <mark4>proud,</mark4><br>
And build on nothing but a passing <mark3>cloud!</mark3><br>
As free from danger as the heavens are <mark3>free</mark3><br>
From pain and toil, there would they build and <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
And sail about the world to scenes <mark4>unheard</mark4><br>
Of and unseen?Oh, were they but a <mark3>bird!</mark3><br>
So think they, while they listen to its <mark4>song,</mark4><br>
And smile and fancy and so pass <mark3>along;</mark3><br>
While its low nest, moist with the dews of <mark4>morn,</mark4><br>
Lies safely, with the leveret, in the <mark3>corn.</mark3><br>
