Title : Turning Forty <br>
Author : Kevin Griffith <br><br>

At times it's like there is a small <mark1>planet</mark1><br>
inside me. And on this <mark1>planet,</mark1><br>
there are many small wars, yet none <br>
big enough to make a real <mark4>difference.</mark4><br>
The major countries--mind and heart--have <br>
called a truce for now. If this planet had a <mark4>ruler,</mark4><br>
no one remembers him <mark4>well</mark4>, <mark4>All</mark4><br>
decisions are made by committee. <br>
Yet there are a few pictures of the old <mark4>dictator--</mark4><br>
how youthful he looked on his big <mark4>horse,</mark4><br>
how bright his eyes. <br>
He was ready to conquer the world.<br>
