Title : Lines to Accompany Flowers for Eve <br>
Author : Carolyn Kizer <br><br>

who took heroin, then sleeping pills, and who lies in a New York <mark4>hospital</mark4><br>
The florist was told, cyclamen or azalea;   <br>
White in either case, for you are <mark4>pale</mark4><br>
As they are, "blooming early and profusely" <br>
Though the azalea grows in sandier <mark4>soil,</mark4><br>
Needing less care; while cyclamen's fleshy tubers   <br>
Are adored, yes, rooted out by some.   <br>
One flourishes in aridness, while the <mark4>other</mark4><br>
Feeds the love which <mark4>devours.</mark4><br>
<br>
But what has flung you here for <mark4>salvaging</mark4><br>
From a city's dereliction, this New York? <br>
A world against whose finger-and-breath-marked <mark4>windows</mark4><br>
These weak flares may be <mark4>set.</mark4><br>
Our only bulwark is the frailest <mark4>cover:</mark4><br>
Lovers touch from terror of being <mark3>alone.</mark3><br>
The urban surface: tough and <mark4>granular,</mark4><br>
Poor ground for the affections to take <mark4>root.</mark4><br>
<br>
Left to our own <mark4>devices</mark4>, we <mark4>devise</mark4><br>
Such curious deaths, <mark4>comas</mark4>, or <mark4>mutilations!</mark4><br>
You may buy peace, white, in sugary <mark4>tincture,</mark4><br>
No way of knowing its strength, or your <mark3>own,</mark3><br>
Until you lie quite still, your perfect <mark4>limbs</mark4><br>
In meditation: the spirit rouses, <mark4>flutters</mark4><br>
Like a handkerchief at a cell window, <mark4>signaling,</mark4><br>
Self-amazed, its willingness to endure. <br>
<br>
The thing to cling to is the sense of <mark4>expectation.</mark4><br>
Who knows what may occur in the next <mark3>breath?</mark3><br>
In the pallor of another morning we <mark4>neither</mark4><br>
Anticipated nor wanted! Eve, waken to <mark4>flowers</mark4><br>
Unforeseen, from someone you don't even know.   <br>
Azalea or cyclamen ... we live in <mark4>wonder,</mark4><br>
Blaze in a cycle of passion and <mark4>apprehension</mark4><br>
Though once we lay and waited for a <mark3>death.</mark3><br>
