Title : I Dreamed That I Was Old <br>
Author : Stanley Kunitz <br><br>

I dreamed that I was old: in stale declension   <br>
Fallen from my prime, when company <br>
Was mine, cat-nimbleness, and green invention,   <br>
Before time took my leafy hours away. <br>
<br>
My wisdom, ripe with body's ruin, <mark3>found</mark3><br>
Itself tart recompense for what was <mark4>lost</mark4><br>
In false exchange: since wisdom in the <mark3>ground</mark3><br>
Has no apocalypse or <mark4>pentecost.</mark4><br>
<br>
I wept for my youth, sweet passionate young <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
And cozy women dead that by my <mark4>side</mark4><br>
Once lay: I wept with bitter longing, <mark4>not</mark4><br>
Remembering how in my youth I <mark3>cried.</mark3><br>
