Title : My Days among the Dead are Past <br>
Author : Robert Southey <br><br>

<br>
My days among the Dead are <mark3>past;</mark3><br>
Around me I <mark3>behold,</mark3><br>
Where'er these casual eyes are <mark3>cast,</mark3><br>
The mighty minds of <mark3>old;</mark3><br>
My never-failing friends are <mark3>they,</mark3><br>
With whom I converse day by <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
<br>
With them I take delight in weal,<br>
And seek relief in <mark3>woe;</mark3><br>
And while I understand and feel<br>
How much to them I <mark3>owe,</mark3><br>
My cheeks have often been bedew'd<br>
With tears of thoughtful <mark4>gratitude.</mark4><br>
<br>
My thoughts are with the Dead, with <mark5>them</mark5><br>
I live in long-past <mark3>years,</mark3><br>
Their virtues love, their faults <mark3>condemn,</mark3><br>
Partake their hopes and <mark3>fears,</mark3><br>
And from their lessons seek and <mark4>find</mark4><br>
Instruction with an humble <mark3>mind.</mark3><br>
<br>
My hopes are with the Dead, anon<br>
    My place with them will be,<br>
And I with them shall travel on<br>
    Through all Futurity;<br>
Yet leaving here a name, I <mark4>trust,</mark4><br>
That will not perish in the <mark3>dust.</mark3><br>
