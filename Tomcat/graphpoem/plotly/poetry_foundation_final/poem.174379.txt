Title : Adonais: An Elegy on the Death of John Keats <br>
Author : Percy Bysshe Shelley <br><br>

<br>
I weep for Adonais--he is <mark3>dead!</mark3><br>
Oh, weep for Adonais! though our <mark3>tears</mark3><br>
Thaw not the frost which binds so dear a <mark3>head!</mark3><br>
And thou, sad Hour, selected from all <mark3>years</mark3><br>
To mourn our loss, rouse thy obscure <mark5>compeers,</mark5><br>
And teach them thine own sorrow, say: "With <mark3>me</mark3><br>
Died Adonais; till the Future <mark4>dares</mark4><br>
Forget the Past, his fate and fame shall <mark3>be</mark3><br>
An echo and a light unto <mark4>eternity!"</mark4><br>
<br>
Where wert thou, mighty Mother, when he <mark3>lay,</mark3><br>
When thy Son lay, pierc'd by the shaft which <mark4>flies</mark4><br>
In darkness? where was lorn <mark1>Urania</mark1><br>
When Adonais died? With veiled <mark3>eyes,</mark3><br>
'Mid listening Echoes, in her <mark4>Paradise</mark4><br>
She sate, while one, with soft enamour'd <mark4>breath,</mark4><br>
Rekindled all the fading <mark4>melodies,</mark4><br>
With which, like flowers that mock the corse <mark4>beneath,</mark4><br>
He had adorn'd and hid the coming bulk of <mark4>Death.</mark4><br>
Oh, weep for Adonais--he is <mark1>dead!</mark1><br>
<br>
Wake, melancholy Mother, wake and <mark3>weep!</mark3><br>
Yet wherefore? Quench within their burning <mark3>bed</mark3><br>
Thy fiery tears, and let thy loud heart <mark3>keep</mark3><br>
Like his, a mute and uncomplaining <mark3>sleep;</mark3><br>
For he is gone, where all things wise and <mark3>fair</mark3><br>
Descend--oh, dream not that the amorous <mark3>Deep</mark3><br>
Will yet restore him to the vital <mark3>air;</mark3><br>
Death feeds on his mute voice, and laughs at our <mark3>despair.</mark3><br>
Most musical of mourners, weep <mark3>again!</mark3><br>
Lament anew, Urania! He <mark4>died,</mark4><br>
<br>
Who was the Sire of an immortal <mark3>strain,</mark3><br>
Blind, old and lonely, when his country's <mark3>pride,</mark3><br>
       The priest, the slave and the liberticide, <br>
Trampled and mock'd with many a loathed <mark3>rite</mark3><br>
       Of lust and blood; he went, unterrified, <br>
Into the gulf of death; but his clear <mark3>Sprite</mark3><br>
Yet reigns o'er earth; the third among the sons of <mark3>light.</mark3><br>
Most musical of mourners, weep <mark3>anew!</mark3><br>
Not all to that bright station dar'd to <mark3>climb;</mark3><br>
And happier they their happiness who <mark3>knew,</mark3><br>
<br>
Whose tapers yet burn through that night of <mark3>time</mark3><br>
In which suns perish'd; others more <mark3>sublime,</mark3><br>
Struck by the envious wrath of man or <mark4>god,</mark4><br>
Have sunk, extinct in their refulgent <mark3>prime;</mark3><br>
And some yet live, treading the thorny <mark4>road,</mark4><br>
Which leads, through toil and hate, to Fame's serene <mark3>abode.</mark3><br>
But now, thy youngest, dearest one, has <mark4>perish'd,</mark4><br>
The nursling of thy widowhood, who <mark3>grew,</mark3><br>
Like a pale flower by some sad maiden <mark3>cherish'd,</mark3><br>
And fed with true-love tears, instead of <mark3>dew;</mark3><br>
<br>
Most musical of mourners, weep <mark1>anew!</mark1><br>
Thy extreme hope, the loveliest and the <mark4>last,</mark4><br>
The bloom, whose petals nipp'd before they <mark3>blew</mark3><br>
Died on the promise of the <mark4>fruit</mark4>, is <mark4>waste;</mark4><br>
The broken lily lies--the storm is <mark5>overpast.</mark5><br>
To that high Capital, where kingly <mark1>Death</mark1><br>
Keeps his pale court in beauty and <mark3>decay,</mark3><br>
He came; and bought, with price of purest <mark1>breath,</mark1><br>
A grave among the eternal.--Come <mark3>away!</mark3><br>
Haste, while the vault of blue Italian <mark3>day</mark3><br>
<br>
Is yet his fitting charnel-roof! while <mark3>still</mark3><br>
He lies, as if in dewy sleep he <mark1>lay;</mark1><br>
Awake him not! surely he takes his <mark3>fill</mark3><br>
Of deep and liquid rest, forgetful of all <mark3>ill.</mark3><br>
He will awake no more, oh, never <mark4>more!</mark4><br>
Within the twilight chamber spreads <mark4>apace</mark4><br>
The shadow of white Death, and at the <mark3>door</mark3><br>
Invisible Corruption waits to <mark3>trace</mark3><br>
His extreme way to her dim <mark3>dwelling-place;</mark3><br>
The eternal Hunger sits, but pity and <mark3>awe</mark3><br>
<br>
Soothe her pale rage, nor dares she to <mark3>deface</mark3><br>
So fair a prey, till darkness and the <mark3>law</mark3><br>
Of change shall o'er his sleep the mortal curtain <mark3>draw.</mark3><br>
Oh, weep for Adonais! The quick <mark4>Dreams,</mark4><br>
The passion-winged Ministers of <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
Who were his flocks, whom near the living <mark3>streams</mark3><br>
Of his young spirit he fed, and whom he <mark3>taught</mark3><br>
The love which was its music, wander <mark4>not--</mark4><br>
Wander no more, from kindling brain to <mark3>brain,</mark3><br>
But droop there, whence they sprung; and mourn their <mark3>lot</mark3><br>
<br>
Round the cold heart, where, after their sweet <mark3>pain,</mark3><br>
They ne'er will gather strength, or find a home <mark1>again.</mark1><br>
And one with trembling hands clasps his cold <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
And fans him with her moonlight <mark4>wings</mark4>, and <mark4>cries,</mark4><br>
"Our love, our hope, our sorrow, is not <mark1>dead;</mark1><br>
See, on the silken fringe of his faint <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
Like dew upon a sleeping flower, there <mark3>lies</mark3><br>
A tear some Dream has loosen'd from his <mark1>brain."</mark1><br>
Lost Angel of a ruin'd <mark1>Paradise!</mark1><br>
She knew not 'twas her <mark4>own</mark4>, as with no <mark3>stain</mark3><br>
<br>
She faded, like a cloud which had outwept its <mark3>rain.</mark3><br>
One from a lucid urn of starry <mark1>dew</mark1><br>
Wash'd his light limbs as if embalming <mark4>them;</mark4><br>
Another clipp'd her profuse locks, and <mark3>threw</mark3><br>
       The wreath upon him, like an anadem, <br>
       Which frozen tears instead of pearls begem; <br>
Another in her wilful grief would <mark5>break</mark5><br>
Her bow and winged reeds, as if to <mark3>stem</mark3><br>
A greater loss with one which was more <mark4>weak;</mark4><br>
And dull the barbed fire against his frozen <mark3>cheek.</mark3><br>
<br>
Another Splendour on his mouth <mark5>alit,</mark5><br>
That <mark4>mouth</mark4>, whence it was wont to draw the <mark1>breath</mark1><br>
Which gave it strength to pierce the guarded <mark4>wit,</mark4><br>
And pass into the panting heart <mark1>beneath</mark1><br>
With lightning and with music: the damp <mark1>death</mark1><br>
Quench'd its caress upon his icy <mark4>lips;</mark4><br>
And, as a dying meteor stains a <mark4>wreath</mark4><br>
Of moonlight vapour, which the cold night <mark3>clips,</mark3><br>
It flush'd through his pale limbs, and pass'd to its <mark3>eclipse.</mark3><br>
       And others came . . . Desires and Adorations, <br>
<br>
Winged Persuasions and veil'd <mark4>Destinies,</mark4><br>
Splendours, and Glooms, and glimmering <mark4>Incarnations</mark4><br>
       Of hopes and fears, and twilight Phantasies; <br>
And Sorrow, with her family of <mark4>Sighs,</mark4><br>
And Pleasure, blind with tears, led by the <mark4>gleam</mark4><br>
Of her own dying smile instead of <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
Came in slow pomp; the moving pomp might <mark3>seem</mark3><br>
Like pageantry of mist on an autumnal <mark3>stream.</mark3><br>
All he had lov'd, and moulded into <mark1>thought,</mark1><br>
From shape, and hue, and odour, and sweet <mark4>sound,</mark4><br>
<br>
Lamented Adonais. Morning <mark3>sought</mark3><br>
Her eastern watch-tower, and her hair <mark3>unbound,</mark3><br>
Wet with the tears which should adorn the <mark3>ground,</mark3><br>
Dimm'd the aereal eyes that kindle <mark1>day;</mark1><br>
Afar the melancholy thunder <mark4>moan'd,</mark4><br>
Pale Ocean in unquiet slumber <mark1>lay,</mark1><br>
And the wild Winds flew round, sobbing in their <mark3>dismay.</mark3><br>
Lost Echo sits amid the voiceless <mark4>mountains,</mark4><br>
And feeds her grief with his remember'd <mark1>lay,</mark1><br>
And will no more reply to winds or <mark3>fountains,</mark3><br>
<br>
Or amorous birds perch'd on the young green <mark3>spray,</mark3><br>
Or herdsman's horn, or bell at closing <mark1>day;</mark1><br>
Since she can mimic not his lips, more <mark4>dear</mark4><br>
Than those for whose disdain she pin'd <mark1>away</mark1><br>
Into a shadow of all sounds: a <mark1>drear</mark1><br>
Murmur, between their songs, is all the woodmen <mark4>hear.</mark4><br>
Grief made the young Spring wild, and she threw <mark4>down</mark4><br>
Her kindling buds, as if she Autumn <mark5>were,</mark5><br>
Or they dead leaves; since her delight is <mark4>flown,</mark4><br>
For whom should she have wak'd the sullen <mark4>year?</mark4><br>
<br>
To Phoebus was not Hyacinth so <mark1>dear</mark1><br>
Nor to himself Narcissus, as to <mark4>both</mark4><br>
Thou, Adonais: wan they stand and <mark3>sere</mark3><br>
Amid the faint companions of their <mark4>youth,</mark4><br>
With dew all turn'd to tears; odour, to sighing <mark3>ruth.</mark3><br>
Thy spirit's sister, the lorn <mark4>nightingale</mark4><br>
Mourns not her mate with such melodious <mark1>pain;</mark1><br>
Not so the <mark4>eagle</mark4>, who like thee could <mark4>scale</mark4><br>
<mark4>Heaven</mark4>, and could nourish in the sun's <mark3>domain</mark3><br>
Her mighty youth with morning, doth <mark3>complain,</mark3><br>
<br>
Soaring and screaming round her empty <mark4>nest,</mark4><br>
As Albion wails for thee: the curse of <mark3>Cain</mark3><br>
Light on his head who pierc'd thy innocent <mark3>breast,</mark3><br>
And scar'd the angel soul that was its earthly <mark3>guest!</mark3><br>
Ah, woe is me! Winter is come and <mark4>gone,</mark4><br>
But grief returns with the revolving <mark1>year;</mark1><br>
The airs and streams renew their joyous <mark4>tone;</mark4><br>
The ants, the bees, the swallows <mark3>reappear;</mark3><br>
Fresh leaves and flowers deck the dead Seasons' <mark4>bier;</mark4><br>
The amorous birds now pair in every <mark4>brake,</mark4><br>
<br>
And build their mossy homes in field and <mark5>brere;</mark5><br>
And the green lizard, and the golden <mark3>snake,</mark3><br>
Like unimprison'd flames, out of their trance <mark3>awake.</mark3><br>
Through wood and stream and field and hill and <mark4>Ocean</mark4><br>
A quickening life from the Earth's heart has <mark4>burst</mark4><br>
As it has ever <mark4>done</mark4>, with change and <mark3>motion,</mark3><br>
From the great morning of the world when <mark3>first</mark3><br>
God dawn'd on Chaos; in its stream <mark5>immers'd,</mark5><br>
The lamps of Heaven flash with a softer <mark1>light;</mark1><br>
All baser things pant with life's sacred <mark4>thirst;</mark4><br>
<br>
Diffuse themselves; and spend in love's <mark4>delight,</mark4><br>
The beauty and the joy of their renewed <mark3>might.</mark3><br>
The leprous corpse, touch'd by this spirit <mark4>tender,</mark4><br>
Exhales itself in flowers of gentle <mark1>breath;</mark1><br>
       Like incarnations of the stars, when splendour <br>
Is chang'd to fragrance, they illumine <mark1>death</mark1><br>
And mock the merry worm that wakes <mark1>beneath;</mark1><br>
Nought we know, <mark4>dies</mark4>, Shall that alone which <mark4>knows</mark4><br>
Be as a sword consum'd before the <mark3>sheath</mark3><br>
By sightless lightning?--the intense atom <mark3>glows</mark3><br>
<br>
A moment, then is quench'd in a most cold <mark3>repose.</mark3><br>
Alas! that all we lov'd of him should <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
But for our grief, as if it had not <mark4>been,</mark4><br>
And grief itself be mortal! Woe is <mark1>me!</mark1><br>
Whence are we, and why are we? of what <mark4>scene</mark4><br>
The actors or spectators? Great and <mark3>mean</mark3><br>
       Meet mass'd in death, who lends what life must borrow. <br>
As long as skies are blue, and fields are <mark3>green,</mark3><br>
Evening must usher night, night urge the <mark5>morrow,</mark5><br>
Month follow month with woe, and year wake year to <mark3>sorrow.</mark3><br>
<br>
He will awake no more, oh, never <mark1>more!</mark1><br>
"Wake thou," cried Misery, "childless Mother, <mark4>rise</mark4><br>
Out of thy sleep, and slake, in thy heart's <mark3>core,</mark3><br>
A wound more fierce than <mark4>his</mark4>, with tears and <mark1>sighs."</mark1><br>
And all the Dreams that watch'd Urania's <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
And all the Echoes whom their sister's <mark4>song</mark4><br>
Had held in holy silence, cried: <mark3>"Arise!"</mark3><br>
Swift as a Thought by the snake Memory <mark4>stung,</mark4><br>
From her ambrosial rest the fading Splendour <mark3>sprung.</mark3><br>
She rose like an autumnal Night, that <mark4>springs</mark4><br>
<br>
Out of the East, and follows wild and <mark1>drear</mark1><br>
The golden Day, which, on eternal <mark3>wings,</mark3><br>
Even as a ghost abandoning a <mark1>bier,</mark1><br>
Had left the Earth a corpse. Sorrow and <mark4>fear</mark4><br>
So struck, so rous'd, so rapt <mark1>Urania;</mark1><br>
So sadden'd round her like an <mark4>atmosphere</mark4><br>
Of stormy mist; so swept her on her <mark3>way</mark3><br>
Even to the mournful place where Adonais <mark1>lay.</mark1><br>
Out of her secret Paradise she <mark4>sped,</mark4><br>
Through camps and cities rough with stone, and <mark4>steel,</mark4><br>
<br>
And human hearts, which to her aery <mark3>tread</mark3><br>
Yielding not, wounded the <mark4>invisible</mark4><br>
Palms of her tender feet where'er they <mark4>fell:</mark4><br>
And barbed tongues, and thoughts more sharp than <mark3>they,</mark3><br>
Rent the soft Form they never could <mark3>repel,</mark3><br>
Whose sacred blood, like the young tears of <mark3>May,</mark3><br>
Pav'd with eternal flowers that undeserving <mark1>way.</mark1><br>
In the death-chamber for a moment <mark1>Death,</mark1><br>
Sham'd by the presence of that living <mark1>Might,</mark1><br>
Blush'd to annihilation, and the <mark1>breath</mark1><br>
<br>
Revisited those lips, and Life's pale <mark1>light</mark1><br>
Flash'd through those limbs, so late her dear <mark1>delight.</mark1><br>
"Leave me not wild and drear and <mark5>comfortless,</mark5><br>
As silent lightning leaves the starless <mark3>night!</mark3><br>
Leave me not!" cried Urania: her <mark4>distress</mark4><br>
Rous'd Death: Death rose and smil'd, and met her vain <mark3>caress.</mark3><br>
"Stay yet awhile! speak to me once <mark1>again;</mark1><br>
Kiss me, so long but as a kiss may <mark3>live;</mark3><br>
And in my heartless breast and burning <mark1>brain</mark1><br>
That word, that kiss, shall all thoughts else <mark3>survive,</mark3><br>
<br>
With food of saddest memory kept <mark3>alive,</mark3><br>
Now thou art dead, as if it were a <mark4>part</mark4><br>
Of thee, my Adonais! I would <mark4>give</mark4><br>
All that I am to be as thou now <mark3>art!</mark3><br>
But I am chain'd to Time, and cannot thence <mark3>depart!</mark3><br>
"O gentle child, beautiful as thou <mark4>wert,</mark4><br>
Why didst thou leave the trodden paths of <mark4>men</mark4><br>
Too soon, and with weak hands though mighty <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
Dare the unpastur'd dragon in his <mark3>den?</mark3><br>
Defenceless as thou wert, oh, where was <mark3>then</mark3><br>
<br>
Wisdom the mirror'd shield, or scorn the <mark4>spear?</mark4><br>
Or hadst thou waited the full cycle, <mark3>when</mark3><br>
Thy spirit should have fill'd its crescent <mark3>sphere,</mark3><br>
The monsters of life's waste had fled from thee like <mark3>deer.</mark3><br>
"The herded wolves, bold only to <mark3>pursue;</mark3><br>
The obscene ravens, clamorous o'er the <mark1>dead;</mark1><br>
The vultures to the conqueror's banner <mark3>true</mark3><br>
Who feed where Desolation first has <mark3>fed,</mark3><br>
And whose wings rain contagion; how they <mark3>fled,</mark3><br>
When, like Apollo, from his golden <mark3>bow</mark3><br>
<br>
The Pythian of the age one arrow <mark1>sped</mark1><br>
And smil'd! The spoilers tempt no second <mark3>blow,</mark3><br>
They fawn on the proud feet that spurn them lying <mark3>low.</mark3><br>
"The sun comes forth, and many reptiles <mark4>spawn;</mark4><br>
He sets, and each ephemeral insect <mark1>then</mark1><br>
Is gather'd into death without a <mark4>dawn,</mark4><br>
And the immortal stars awake <mark1>again;</mark1><br>
So is it in the world of living <mark1>men:</mark1><br>
A godlike mind soars forth, in its <mark1>delight</mark1><br>
Making earth bare and veiling <mark4>heaven</mark4>, and <mark1>when</mark1><br>
<br>
It sinks, the swarms that dimm'd or shar'd its <mark1>light</mark1><br>
Leave to its kindred lamps the spirit's awful <mark1>night."</mark1><br>
Thus ceas'd she: and the mountain shepherds <mark4>came,</mark4><br>
Their garlands sere, their magic mantles <mark4>rent;</mark4><br>
The Pilgrim of Eternity, whose <mark3>fame</mark3><br>
Over his living head like Heaven is <mark3>bent,</mark3><br>
An early but enduring <mark4>monument,</mark4><br>
Came, veiling all the lightnings of his <mark1>song</mark1><br>
In sorrow; from her wilds Ierne <mark4>sent</mark4><br>
The sweetest lyrist of her saddest <mark3>wrong,</mark3><br>
<br>
And Love taught Grief to fall like music from his <mark4>tongue.</mark4><br>
Midst others of less note, came one frail <mark4>Form,</mark4><br>
A phantom among men; <mark5>companionless</mark5><br>
As the last cloud of an expiring <mark3>storm</mark3><br>
Whose thunder is its knell; he, as I <mark3>guess,</mark3><br>
Had gaz'd on Nature's naked <mark5>loveliness,</mark5><br>
Actaeon-like, and now he fled <mark3>astray</mark3><br>
With feeble steps o'er the world's <mark4>wilderness,</mark4><br>
And his own thoughts, along that rugged <mark1>way,</mark1><br>
Pursu'd, like raging hounds, their father and their <mark3>prey.</mark3><br>
<br>
A pardlike Spirit beautiful and <mark4>swift--</mark4><br>
A Love in desolation mask'd--a <mark4>Power</mark4><br>
Girt round with weakness--it can scarce <mark4>uplift</mark4><br>
The weight of the superincumbent <mark3>hour;</mark3><br>
It is a dying lamp, a falling <mark3>shower,</mark3><br>
A breaking billow; even whilst we <mark4>speak</mark4><br>
Is it not broken? On the withering <mark3>flower</mark3><br>
The killing sun smiles brightly: on a <mark1>cheek</mark1><br>
The life can burn in blood, even while the heart may <mark1>break.</mark1><br>
His head was bound with pansies <mark4>overblown,</mark4><br>
<br>
And faded violets, white, and pied, and <mark3>blue;</mark3><br>
And a light spear topp'd with a cypress <mark3>cone,</mark3><br>
Round whose rude shaft dark ivy-tresses <mark1>grew</mark1><br>
Yet dripping with the forest's noonday <mark1>dew,</mark1><br>
Vibrated, as the ever-beating <mark1>heart</mark1><br>
Shook the weak hand that grasp'd it; of that <mark3>crew</mark3><br>
He came the <mark4>last</mark4>, neglected and <mark3>apart;</mark3><br>
A herd-abandon'd deer struck by the hunter's <mark3>dart.</mark3><br>
All stood aloof, and at his partial <mark3>moan</mark3><br>
Smil'd through their tears; well knew that gentle <mark4>band</mark4><br>
<br>
Who in another's fate now wept his <mark3>own,</mark3><br>
As in the accents of an unknown <mark3>land</mark3><br>
He sung new sorrow; sad Urania <mark5>scann'd</mark5><br>
The Stranger's mien, and murmur'd: "Who art <mark3>thou?"</mark3><br>
He answer'd not, but with a sudden <mark3>hand</mark3><br>
Made bare his branded and ensanguin'd <mark3>brow,</mark3><br>
Which was like Cain's or Christ's--oh! that it should be <mark3>so!</mark3><br>
What softer voice is hush'd over the <mark1>dead?</mark1><br>
Athwart what brow is that dark mantle <mark3>thrown?</mark3><br>
What form leans sadly o'er the white <mark4>death-bed,</mark4><br>
<br>
In mockery of monumental <mark3>stone,</mark3><br>
The heavy heart heaving without a <mark1>moan?</mark1><br>
If it be He, who, gentlest of the <mark4>wise,</mark4><br>
Taught, sooth'd, lov'd, honour'd the departed <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
Let me not vex, with inharmonious <mark1>sighs,</mark1><br>
The silence of that heart's accepted <mark4>sacrifice.</mark4><br>
       Our Adonais has drunk poison--oh! <br>
What deaf and viperous murderer could <mark4>crown</mark4><br>
Life's early cup with such a draught of <mark3>woe?</mark3><br>
The nameless worm would now itself <mark4>disown:</mark4><br>
<br>
It felt, yet could escape, the magic <mark1>tone</mark1><br>
Whose prelude held all envy, hate and <mark1>wrong,</mark1><br>
But what was howling in one breast <mark3>alone,</mark3><br>
Silent with expectation of the <mark1>song,</mark1><br>
Whose master's hand is cold, whose silver lyre unstrung. <br>
Live thou, whose infamy is not thy <mark1>fame!</mark1><br>
Live! fear no heavier chastisement from <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Thou noteless blot on a remember'd <mark3>name!</mark3><br>
But be thyself, and know thyself to <mark1>be!</mark1><br>
And ever at thy season be thou <mark3>free</mark3><br>
<br>
To spill the venom when thy fangs <mark4>o'erflow;</mark4><br>
Remorse and Self-contempt shall cling to <mark3>thee;</mark3><br>
Hot Shame shall burn upon thy secret <mark1>brow,</mark1><br>
And like a beaten hound tremble thou shalt--as <mark3>now.</mark3><br>
Nor let us weep that our delight is <mark1>fled</mark1><br>
Far from these carrion kites that scream <mark3>below;</mark3><br>
He wakes or sleeps with the enduring <mark1>dead;</mark1><br>
Thou canst not soar where he is sitting <mark1>now.</mark1><br>
Dust to the dust! but the pure spirit shall <mark3>flow</mark3><br>
Back to the burning fountain whence it <mark1>came,</mark1><br>
<br>
A portion of the Eternal, which must <mark3>glow</mark3><br>
Through time and change, unquenchably the <mark3>same,</mark3><br>
Whilst thy cold embers choke the sordid hearth of <mark3>shame.</mark3><br>
Peace, peace! he is not dead, he doth not <mark1>sleep,</mark1><br>
He hath awaken'd from the dream of <mark3>life;</mark3><br>
'Tis we, who lost in stormy visions, <mark1>keep</mark1><br>
With phantoms an unprofitable <mark3>strife,</mark3><br>
And in mad trance, strike with our spirit's <mark3>knife</mark3><br>
Invulnerable nothings.  We <mark1>decay</mark1><br>
Like corpses in a charnel; fear and <mark4>grief</mark4><br>
<br>
Convulse us and consume us day by <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
And cold hopes swarm like worms within our living <mark3>clay.</mark3><br>
He has outsoar'd the shadow of our <mark1>night;</mark1><br>
Envy and calumny and hate and <mark1>pain,</mark1><br>
And that unrest which men miscall <mark1>delight,</mark1><br>
Can touch him not and torture not <mark1>again;</mark1><br>
From the contagion of the world's slow <mark1>stain</mark1><br>
He is secure, and now can never <mark4>mourn</mark4><br>
A heart grown cold, a head grown gray in <mark4>vain;</mark4><br>
Nor, when the spirit's self has ceas'd to <mark4>burn,</mark4><br>
<br>
With sparkless ashes load an unlamented <mark3>urn.</mark3><br>
He lives, he wakes--'tis Death is dead, not <mark3>he;</mark3><br>
Mourn not for Adonais. Thou young <mark1>Dawn,</mark1><br>
Turn all thy dew to splendour, for from <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
The spirit thou lamentest is not <mark1>gone;</mark1><br>
Ye caverns and ye forests, cease to <mark1>moan!</mark1><br>
Cease, ye faint flowers and fountains, and thou <mark1>Air,</mark1><br>
Which like a mourning veil thy scarf hadst <mark1>thrown</mark1><br>
O'er the abandon'd Earth, now leave it <mark3>bare</mark3><br>
Even to the joyous stars which smile on its <mark1>despair!</mark1><br>
<br>
He is made one with Nature: there is <mark4>heard</mark4><br>
His voice in all her music, from the <mark1>moan</mark1><br>
Of thunder, to the song of night's sweet <mark3>bird;</mark3><br>
He is a presence to be felt and <mark3>known</mark3><br>
In darkness and in light, from herb and <mark1>stone,</mark1><br>
Spreading itself where'er that Power may <mark4>move</mark4><br>
Which has withdrawn his being to its <mark1>own;</mark1><br>
Which wields the world with never-wearied <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
Sustains it from beneath, and kindles it <mark3>above.</mark3><br>
He is a portion of the <mark1>loveliness</mark1><br>
<br>
Which once he made more lovely: he doth <mark3>bear</mark3><br>
His part, while the one Spirit's plastic <mark4>stress</mark4><br>
Sweeps through the dull dense world, compelling <mark3>there</mark3><br>
All new successions to the forms they <mark3>wear;</mark3><br>
Torturing th' unwilling dross that checks its <mark3>flight</mark3><br>
To its own likeness, as each mass may <mark1>bear;</mark1><br>
And bursting in its beauty and its <mark1>might</mark1><br>
From trees and beasts and men into the Heaven's <mark1>light.</mark1><br>
The splendours of the firmament of <mark1>time</mark1><br>
May be eclips'd, but are extinguish'd <mark1>not;</mark1><br>
<br>
Like stars to their appointed height they <mark1>climb,</mark1><br>
And death is a low mist which cannot <mark3>blot</mark3><br>
The brightness it may veil. When lofty <mark1>thought</mark1><br>
Lifts a young heart above its mortal <mark3>lair,</mark3><br>
And love and life contend in it for <mark4>what</mark4><br>
Shall be its earthly doom, the dead live <mark1>there</mark1><br>
And move like winds of light on dark and stormy <mark1>air.</mark1><br>
The inheritors of unfulfill'd <mark4>renown</mark4><br>
Rose from their thrones, built beyond mortal <mark1>thought,</mark1><br>
Far in the Unapparent. <mark4>Chatterton</mark4><br>
<br>
Rose pale, his solemn agony had <mark1>not</mark1><br>
Yet faded from him; Sidney, as he <mark4>fought</mark4><br>
And as he fell and as he liv'd and <mark5>lov'd</mark5><br>
Sublimely mild, a Spirit without <mark4>spot,</mark4><br>
       Arose; and Lucan, by his death approv'd: <br>
Oblivion as they rose shrank like a thing <mark5>reprov'd.</mark5><br>
And many more, whose names on Earth are <mark4>dark,</mark4><br>
But whose transmitted effluence cannot <mark5>die</mark5><br>
So long as fire outlives the parent <mark3>spark,</mark3><br>
Rose, rob'd in dazzling <mark4>immortality.</mark4><br>
<br>
"Thou art become as one of us," they <mark3>cry,</mark3><br>
"It was for thee yon kingless sphere has <mark3>long</mark3><br>
Swung blind in unascended <mark4>majesty,</mark4><br>
Silent alone amid a Heaven of <mark1>Song.</mark1><br>
Assume thy winged throne, thou Vesper of our <mark3>throng!"</mark3><br>
Who mourns for Adonais? Oh, come <mark4>forth,</mark4><br>
       Fond wretch! and know thyself and him aright. <br>
Clasp with thy panting soul the pendulous <mark4>Earth;</mark4><br>
As from a centre, dart thy spirit's <mark1>light</mark1><br>
Beyond all worlds, until its spacious <mark1>might</mark1><br>
<br>
Satiate the void circumference: then <mark4>shrink</mark4><br>
Even to a point within our day and <mark1>night;</mark1><br>
And keep thy heart light lest it make thee <mark3>sink</mark3><br>
When hope has kindled hope, and lur'd thee to the <mark3>brink.</mark3><br>
       Or go to Rome, which is the sepulchre, <br>
       Oh, not of him, but of our joy: 'tis nought <br>
That ages, empires and religions <mark1>there</mark1><br>
Lie buried in the ravage they have <mark4>wrought;</mark4><br>
For such as he can lend--they borrow <mark1>not</mark1><br>
Glory from those who made the world their <mark1>prey;</mark1><br>
<br>
And he is gather'd to the kings of <mark1>thought</mark1><br>
Who wag'd contention with their time's <mark1>decay,</mark1><br>
And of the past are all that cannot pass <mark1>away.</mark1><br>
Go thou to Rome--at once the <mark1>Paradise,</mark1><br>
The grave, the city, and the <mark1>wilderness;</mark1><br>
And where its wrecks like shatter'd mountains <mark1>rise,</mark1><br>
And flowering weeds, and fragrant copses <mark4>dress</mark4><br>
       The bones of Desolation's nakedness <br>
Pass, till the spirit of the spot shall <mark4>lead</mark4><br>
Thy footsteps to a slope of green <mark4>access</mark4><br>
<br>
Where, like an infant's smile, over the <mark1>dead</mark1><br>
A light of laughing flowers along the grass is <mark3>spread;</mark3><br>
And gray walls moulder round, on which dull <mark1>Time</mark1><br>
Feeds, like slow fire upon a hoary <mark4>brand;</mark4><br>
And one keen pyramid with wedge <mark1>sublime,</mark1><br>
       Pavilioning the dust of him who plann'd <br>
This refuge for his memory, doth <mark3>stand</mark3><br>
Like flame transform'd to marble; and <mark1>beneath,</mark1><br>
A field is <mark4>spread</mark4>, on which a newer <mark1>band</mark1><br>
Have pitch'd in Heaven's smile their camp of <mark1>death,</mark1><br>
<br>
Welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguish'd <mark1>breath.</mark1><br>
Here pause: these graves are all too young as <mark4>yet</mark4><br>
To have outgrown the sorrow which <mark4>consign'd</mark4><br>
Its charge to each; and if the seal is <mark3>set,</mark3><br>
Here, on one fountain of a mourning <mark4>mind,</mark4><br>
Break it not thou! too surely shalt thou <mark3>find</mark3><br>
Thine own well full, if thou returnest <mark4>home,</mark4><br>
Of tears and gall. From the world's bitter <mark3>wind</mark3><br>
Seek shelter in the shadow of the <mark4>tomb.</mark4><br>
What Adonais is, why fear we to <mark4>become?</mark4><br>
<br>
The One remains, the many change and <mark4>pass;</mark4><br>
Heaven's light forever shines, Earth's shadows <mark3>fly;</mark3><br>
Life, like a dome of many-colour'd <mark3>glass,</mark3><br>
Stains the white radiance of <mark1>Eternity,</mark1><br>
       Until Death tramples it to fragments.--Die, <br>
If thou wouldst be with that which thou dost <mark4>seek!</mark4><br>
Follow where all is fled!--Rome's azure <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
Flowers, ruins, statues, music, words, are <mark1>weak</mark1><br>
The glory they transfuse with fitting truth to <mark1>speak.</mark1><br>
Why linger, why turn back, why shrink, my <mark1>Heart?</mark1><br>
<br>
Thy hopes are gone before: from all things <mark4>here</mark4><br>
They have departed; thou shouldst now <mark1>depart!</mark1><br>
A light is pass'd from the revolving <mark1>year,</mark1><br>
And man, and woman; and what still is <mark1>dear</mark1><br>
Attracts to crush, repels to make thee <mark4>wither.</mark4><br>
The soft sky smiles, the low wind whispers <mark3>near:</mark3><br>
'Tis Adonais calls! oh, hasten <mark5>thither,</mark5><br>
No more let Life divide what Death can join <mark4>together.</mark4><br>
That Light whose smile kindles the <mark4>Universe,</mark4><br>
That Beauty in which all things work and <mark1>move,</mark1><br>
<br>
That Benediction which the eclipsing <mark4>Curse</mark4><br>
Of birth can quench not, that sustaining <mark1>Love</mark1><br>
Which through the web of being blindly <mark4>wove</mark4><br>
By man and beast and earth and air and <mark3>sea,</mark3><br>
Burns bright or dim, as each are mirrors <mark4>of</mark4><br>
The fire for which all thirst; now beams on <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Consuming the last clouds of cold <mark4>mortality.</mark4><br>
The breath whose might I have invok'd in <mark1>song</mark1><br>
Descends on me; my spirit's bark is <mark4>driven,</mark4><br>
Far from the shore, far from the trembling <mark1>throng</mark1><br>
<br>
Whose sails were never to the tempest <mark3>given;</mark3><br>
The massy earth and sphered skies are <mark3>riven!</mark3><br>
I am borne darkly, fearfully, <mark4>afar;</mark4><br>
Whilst, burning through the inmost veil of <mark4>Heaven,</mark4><br>
The soul of Adonais, like a <mark3>star,</mark3><br>
Beacons from the abode where the Eternal <mark3>are.</mark3><br>
