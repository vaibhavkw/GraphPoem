Title : The Guest Ellen at the Supper for Street People <br>
Author : David Ferry <br><br>

The unclean spirits cry out in the <mark1>body</mark1><br>
Or mind of the guest Ellen in a loud <mark1>voice</mark1><br>
Torment me not, and in the fury of her <mark1>unclean</mark1><br>
Hands beating the air in some kind of unending <mark3>torment--</mark3><br>
Nobody witnessing could possibly know the <mark3>event</mark3><br>
That cast upon her the spell of this <mark4>enchantment.</mark4><br>
<br>
Almost all the guests are under some kind of <mark1>enchantment:</mark1><br>
Of being poor day after day in the same <mark1>body;</mark1><br>
Of being witness still to some obscene <mark1>event;</mark1><br>
Of listening all the time to somebody's <mark1>voice</mark1><br>
Whispering in the ear things divine or <mark1>unclean,</mark1><br>
In the quotidian of unending <mark1>torment.</mark1><br>
<br>
One has to keep thinking there was some source of <mark1>torment,</mark1><br>
Something that happened someplace else, <mark1>unclean.</mark1><br>
One has to keep talking in a reasonable <mark1>voice</mark1><br>
About things done, say, by a father's <mark1>body</mark1><br>
To or upon the body of Ellen, in <mark1>enchantment</mark1><br>
Helpless, still by the unforgotten <mark1>event</mark1><br>
<br>
Enchanted, still in the old forgotten <mark1>event</mark1><br>
A prisoner of love, filthy Ellen in her <mark1>torment,</mark1><br>
Guest Ellen in the dining hall in her <mark1>body,</mark1><br>
Hands beating the air in her <mark1>enchantment,</mark1><br>
Sitting alone, gabbling in her garbled <mark1>voice</mark1><br>
The narrative of the spirits of the <mark1>unclean.</mark1><br>
<br>
She is wholly the possessed one of the <mark1>unclean.</mark1><br>
Maybe the spirits came from the river. The <mark1>enchantment</mark1><br>
Entered her, maybe, in the Northeast Kingdom. The <mark1>torment,</mark1><br>
A thing of the waters, gratuitous <mark1>event,</mark1><br>
Came up out of the waters and entered her <mark1>body</mark1><br>
And lived in her in torment and cried out in her <mark1>voice.</mark1><br>
<br>
It speaks itself over and over again in her <mark1>voice,</mark1><br>
Cursing maybe or not a familiar obscene <mark1>event</mark1><br>
Or only the pure event of original <mark1>enchantment</mark1><br>
From the birth of the river waters, the pure <mark1>unclean</mark1><br>
Rising from the source of things, in a figure of <mark1>torment</mark1><br>
Seeking out Ellen, finding its home in her poor <mark1>body.</mark1><br>
<br>
Her body witness is, so also is her <mark1>voice,</mark1><br>
Of torment coming from unknown <mark1>event;</mark1><br>
Unclean is the nature and name of the <mark1>enchantment.</mark1><br>
