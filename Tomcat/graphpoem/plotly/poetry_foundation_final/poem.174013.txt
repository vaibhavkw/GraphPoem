Title : Sonnet 18: Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughter'd saints, whose bones <br>
Author : John Milton <br><br>

On the Late Massacre in Piedmont<br>
Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughter'd saints, whose <mark3>bones</mark3><br>
Lie scatter'd on the Alpine mountains <mark3>cold,</mark3><br>
Ev'n them who kept thy truth so pure of <mark3>old,</mark3><br>
When all our fathers worshipp'd stocks and <mark3>stones;</mark3><br>
Forget not: in thy book record their <mark3>groans</mark3><br>
Who were thy sheep and in their ancient <mark3>fold</mark3><br>
Slain by the bloody Piemontese that <mark4>roll'd</mark4><br>
Mother with infant down the rocks. Their <mark4>moans</mark4><br>
The vales redoubl'd to the hills, and <mark3>they</mark3><br>
To Heav'n. Their martyr'd blood and ashes <mark3>sow</mark3><br>
O'er all th' Italian fields where still doth <mark3>sway</mark3><br>
The triple tyrant; that from these may <mark3>grow</mark3><br>
A hundred-fold, who having learnt thy <mark3>way</mark3><br>
Early may fly the Babylonian <mark3>woe.</mark3><br>
