Title : The Skeleton in Armor <br>
Author : Henry Wadsworth Longfellow <br><br>

"Speak! speak! thou fearful <mark3>guest!</mark3><br>
Who, with thy hollow <mark3>breast</mark3><br>
Still in rude armor drest, <br>
Comest to daunt <mark1>me!</mark1><br>
Wrapt not in Eastern <mark3>balms,</mark3><br>
But with thy fleshless <mark3>palms</mark3><br>
Stretched, as if asking <mark3>alms,</mark3><br>
Why dost thou haunt <mark1>me?"</mark1><br>
<br>
Then, from those cavernous <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
Pale flashes seemed to <mark3>rise,</mark3><br>
As when the Northern <mark3>skies</mark3><br>
Gleam in <mark4>December;</mark4><br>
And, like the water's <mark3>flow</mark3><br>
Under December's <mark3>snow,</mark3><br>
Came a dull voice of <mark3>woe</mark3><br>
From the heart's <mark4>chamber.</mark4><br>
<br>
"I was a Viking <mark4>old!</mark4><br>
My deeds, though <mark4>manifold,</mark4><br>
No Skald in song has <mark4>told,</mark4><br>
No Saga taught <mark3>thee!</mark3><br>
Take heed, that in thy <mark3>verse</mark3><br>
Thou dost the tale <mark3>rehearse,</mark3><br>
Else dread a dead man's <mark3>curse;</mark3><br>
For this I sought <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
<br>
"Far in the Northern <mark4>Land,</mark4><br>
By the wild Baltic's <mark3>strand,</mark3><br>
I, with my childish <mark3>hand,</mark3><br>
      Tamed the gerfalcon; <br>
<mark4>And</mark4>, with my skates <mark4>fast-bound,</mark4><br>
Skimmed the half-frozen <mark3>Sound,</mark3><br>
That the poor whimpering <mark3>hound</mark3><br>
Trembled to walk <mark4>on.</mark4><br>
<br>
"Oft to his frozen <mark3>lair</mark3><br>
Tracked I the grisly <mark3>bear,</mark3><br>
While from my path the <mark3>hare</mark3><br>
Fled like a <mark3>shadow;</mark3><br>
Oft through the forest <mark3>dark</mark3><br>
Followed the were-wolf's <mark3>bark,</mark3><br>
Until the soaring <mark3>lark</mark3><br>
Sang from the <mark3>meadow.</mark3><br>
<br>
"But when I older <mark3>grew,</mark3><br>
Joining a corsair's <mark3>crew,</mark3><br>
O'er the dark sea I <mark3>flew</mark3><br>
With the <mark4>marauders.</mark4><br>
Wild was the life we <mark4>led;</mark4><br>
Many the souls that <mark3>sped,</mark3><br>
Many the hearts that <mark3>bled,</mark3><br>
By our stern <mark4>orders.</mark4><br>
<br>
"Many a <mark4>wassail-bout</mark4><br>
Wore the long Winter <mark3>out;</mark3><br>
Often our midnight <mark3>shout</mark3><br>
      Set the cocks crowing, <br>
As we the Berserk's <mark3>tale</mark3><br>
Measured in cups of <mark3>ale,</mark3><br>
Draining the oaken <mark3>pail,</mark3><br>
Filled to <mark4>o'erflowing.</mark4><br>
<br>
"Once as I told in <mark3>glee</mark3><br>
Tales of the stormy <mark3>sea,</mark3><br>
Soft eyes did gaze on <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Burning yet <mark4>tender;</mark4><br>
And as the white stars <mark4>shine</mark4><br>
On the dark Norway <mark3>pine,</mark3><br>
On that dark heart of <mark3>mine</mark3><br>
Fell their soft <mark3>splendor.</mark3><br>
<br>
"I wooed the blue-eyed <mark4>maid,</mark4><br>
Yielding, yet half <mark3>afraid,</mark3><br>
And in the forest's <mark3>shade</mark3><br>
      Our vows were plighted. <br>
Under its loosened <mark4>vest</mark4><br>
Fluttered her little <mark1>breast,</mark1><br>
Like birds within their <mark3>nest</mark3><br>
      By the hawk frighted. <br>
<br>
"Bright in her father's <mark4>hall</mark4><br>
Shields gleamed upon the <mark3>wall,</mark3><br>
Loud sang the minstrels <mark3>all,</mark3><br>
Chanting his <mark3>glory;</mark3><br>
When of old <mark4>Hildebrand</mark4><br>
I asked his daughter's <mark1>hand,</mark1><br>
Mute did the minstrels <mark3>stand</mark3><br>
To hear my <mark3>story.</mark3><br>
<br>
"While the brown ale he <mark4>quaffed,</mark4><br>
Loud then the champion <mark4>laughed,</mark4><br>
And as the wind-gusts <mark4>waft</mark4><br>
The sea-foam <mark4>brightly,</mark4><br>
So the loud laugh of <mark4>scorn,</mark4><br>
Out of those lips unshorn, <br>
From the deep <mark3>drinking-horn</mark3><br>
Blew the foam <mark3>lightly.</mark3><br>
<br>
"She was a Prince's <mark4>child,</mark4><br>
I but a Viking <mark3>wild,</mark3><br>
And though she blushed and <mark3>smiled,</mark3><br>
I was <mark4>discarded!</mark4><br>
Should not the dove so <mark4>white</mark4><br>
Follow the sea-mew's <mark3>flight,</mark3><br>
Why did they leave that <mark3>night</mark3><br>
Her nest <mark3>unguarded?</mark3><br>
<br>
"Scarce had I put to <mark1>sea,</mark1><br>
Bearing the maid with <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Fairest of all was <mark3>she</mark3><br>
Among the <mark4>Norsemen!</mark4><br>
When on the white <mark4>sea-strand,</mark4><br>
Waving his armed <mark1>hand,</mark1><br>
Saw we old <mark1>Hildebrand,</mark1><br>
With twenty <mark4>horsemen.</mark4><br>
<br>
"Then launched they to the <mark4>blast,</mark4><br>
Bent like a reed each <mark3>mast,</mark3><br>
Yet we were gaining <mark3>fast,</mark3><br>
When the wind failed <mark4>us;</mark4><br>
And with a sudden <mark3>flaw</mark3><br>
Came round the gusty Skaw, <br>
So that our foe we <mark3>saw</mark3><br>
Laugh as he hailed <mark1>us.</mark1><br>
<br>
"And as to catch the <mark4>gale</mark4><br>
Round veered the flapping <mark3>sail,</mark3><br>
'Death!' was the helmsman's <mark3>hail,</mark3><br>
'Death without <mark4>quarter!'</mark4><br>
Mid-ships with iron <mark4>keel</mark4><br>
Struck we her ribs of <mark3>steel;</mark3><br>
Down her black hulk did <mark3>reel</mark3><br>
Through the black <mark4>water!</mark4><br>
<br>
"As with his wings aslant, <br>
Sails the fierce <mark4>cormorant,</mark4><br>
Seeking some rocky <mark4>haunt,</mark4><br>
With his prey laden, <mark4>--</mark4><br>
So toward the open <mark4>main,</mark4><br>
Beating to sea <mark3>again,</mark3><br>
Through the wild <mark4>hurricane,</mark4><br>
Bore I the <mark4>maiden.</mark4><br>
<br>
"Three weeks we westward <mark4>bore,</mark4><br>
And when the storm was <mark2>o'er,</mark2><br>
Cloud-like we saw the <mark3>shore</mark3><br>
Stretching to <mark4>leeward;</mark4><br>
There for my lady's <mark4>bower</mark4><br>
Built I the lofty <mark3>tower,</mark3><br>
Which, to this very <mark3>hour,</mark3><br>
Stands looking <mark3>seaward.</mark3><br>
<br>
"There lived we many <mark4>years;</mark4><br>
Time dried the maiden's <mark3>tears;</mark3><br>
She had forgot her <mark3>fears,</mark3><br>
She was a <mark4>mother;</mark4><br>
Death closed her mild blue <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
Under that tower she <mark3>lies;</mark3><br>
Ne'er shall the sun <mark3>arise</mark3><br>
On such <mark3>another!</mark3><br>
<br>
"Still grew my bosom <mark4>then,</mark4><br>
Still as a stagnant <mark3>fen!</mark3><br>
Hateful to me were <mark3>men,</mark3><br>
The sunlight <mark4>hateful!</mark4><br>
In the vast forest <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
Clad in my warlike <mark4>gear,</mark4><br>
Fell I upon my <mark3>spear,</mark3><br>
Oh, death was <mark3>grateful!</mark3><br>
<br>
"Thus, seamed with many <mark4>scars,</mark4><br>
Bursting these prison <mark3>bars,</mark3><br>
Up to its native <mark3>stars</mark3><br>
My soul <mark4>ascended!</mark4><br>
There from the flowing <mark4>bowl</mark4><br>
Deep drinks the warrior's <mark3>soul,</mark3><br>
Skoal! to the Northland! <mark3>skoal!"</mark3><br>
Thus the tale <mark3>ended.</mark3><br>
