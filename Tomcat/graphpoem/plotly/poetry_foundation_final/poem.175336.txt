Title : Whatever Is <br>
Author : Charlotte Anna Perkins Gilman <br><br>

Whatever is we only <mark3>know</mark3><br>
As in our minds we find it <mark3>so;</mark3><br>
No staring fact is half so <mark4>clear</mark4><br>
      As one dim, preconceived idea --<br>
No matter how the fact may <mark3>glow.</mark3><br>
<br>
Vainly may Truth her trumpet <mark3>blow</mark3><br>
To stir our minds; like heavy <mark3>dough</mark3><br>
They stick to what they think ? won't <mark4>hear</mark4><br>
Whatever <mark1>is.</mark1><br>
<br>
Our ancient myths in solid <mark3>row</mark3><br>
Stand up ? we simply have to <mark3>go</mark3><br>
And choke each fiction old and <mark4>dear</mark4><br>
Before the modest facts <mark3>appear;</mark3><br>
Then we may grasp, reluctant, <mark3>slow,</mark3><br>
Whatever <mark1>is.</mark1><br>
