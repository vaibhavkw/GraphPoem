Title : The Night of the Shirts <br>
Author : W. S. Merwin <br><br>

Oh pile of white shirts who is <mark4>coming</mark4><br>
to breathe in your shapes to carry your <mark4>numbers</mark4><br>
to <mark4>appear</mark4><br>
what <mark4>hearts</mark4><br>
are moving toward their garments <mark4>here</mark4><br>
their <mark4>days</mark4><br>
what troubles beating between <mark4>arms</mark4><br>
<br>
you look upward through <br>
each other saying nothing has <mark4>happened</mark4><br>
and it has gone away and is <mark4>sleeping</mark4><br>
having told the same <mark5>story</mark5><br>
and we exist from <mark4>within</mark4><br>
eyes of the <mark4>gods</mark4><br>
<br>
you lie on your <mark4>backs</mark4><br>
and the wounds are not <mark4>made</mark4><br>
the blood has not <mark4>heard</mark4><br>
the boat has not turned to <mark4>stone</mark4><br>
and the dark wires to the bulb <br>
are full of the voice of the <mark4>unborn</mark4><br>
