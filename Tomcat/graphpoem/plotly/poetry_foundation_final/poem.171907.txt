Title : Misreading Housman <br>
Author : Linda Pastan <br><br>

On this first day of spring, snow <br>
covers the fruit trees, mingling <mark4>improbably</mark4><br>
with the new blossoms like identical <mark4>twins</mark4><br>
brought up in different hemispheres.   <br>
It is not what Housman <mark4>meant</mark4><br>
when he wrote of the <mark4>cherry</mark4><br>
hung with snow, though he also knew   <br>
how death can mistake the <mark4>seasons,</mark4><br>
and if he made it all sound <mark4>pretty,</mark4><br>
that was our <mark4>misreading</mark4><br>
in those high school <mark4>classrooms</mark4><br>
where, drunk on boredom, we had to <mark4>recite</mark4><br>
his poems. Now the weather is always <mark4>looming</mark4><br>
<br>
in the background, trying to become more   <br>
than merely scenery, and though today   <br>
it is telling us <mark4>something</mark4><br>
we don't want to hear, it is <mark4>all</mark4><br>
so <mark4>unpredictable</mark4>, so out of <mark4>control</mark4><br>
that we might as well be children again,   <br>
hearing the voices of thunder <br>
like baritone uncles <mark4>shouting</mark4><br>
in the next room as we try to sleep,   <br>
or hearing the silence of snow <mark4>falling</mark4><br>
soft as a coverlet, even in springtime   <br>
whispering: relax, there is <mark4>nothing</mark4><br>
you can possibly do about any of this. <br>
