Title : River Road <br>
Author : Stanley Kunitz <br><br>

That year of the <mark4>cloud</mark4>, when my marriage <mark4>failed,</mark4><br>
I slept in a chair, by the flagstone <mark5>hearth,</mark5><br>
fighting my sleep, <br>
and one night saw a Hessian <mark4>soldier</mark4><br>
stand at attention there in <mark4>full</mark4><br>
regalia, till his head broke into <mark4>flames.</mark4><br>
My only other callers were the <mark3>FBI</mark3><br>
sent to investigate me as a Russian <mark3>spy</mark3><br>
by patriotic neighbors on the river <mark4>road;</mark4><br>
and flying squirrels parachuting from the <mark4>elms</mark4><br>
who squeaked in rodent heat between the <mark4>walls</mark4><br>
and upstairs rumbled at their nutty <mark4>games.</mark4><br>
I never dared open the attic <mark3>door.</mark3><br>
Even my nervous Leghorns joined the act,   <br>
indulging their taste for chicken from <mark4>behind.</mark4><br>
A glazed look swam into the survivors' <mark4>eyes;</mark4><br>
they caught a sort of <mark4>dancing-sickness,</mark4><br>
a variation of the blind <mark4>staggers,</mark4><br>
that hunched their narrow backs and struck   <br>
a stiffened wing akimbo, <br>
as round and round the poultry <mark4>yard</mark4><br>
they flapped and dropped and flapped <mark4>again.</mark4><br>
The county agent shook his <mark4>head:</mark4><br>
not one of them was spared the <mark4>cyanide.</mark4><br>
<br>
That year of the <mark4>cloud</mark4>, when my marriage <mark1>failed,</mark1><br>
I paced up and down the <mark4>bottom-fields,</mark4><br>
tamping the mud-puddled nurslings <mark4>in</mark4><br>
with a sharp blow of the <mark4>heel</mark4><br>
timed to the chop-chop of the <mark3>hoe:</mark3><br>
red pine and white, larch, balsam fir, <br>
one stride apart, two hundred to the <mark3>row,</mark3><br>
until I heard from Rossiter's <mark4>woods</mark4><br>
the downward spiral of a veery's <mark3>song</mark3><br>
unwinding on the eve of <mark3>war.</mark3><br>
<br>
Lord! Lord! who has lived so <mark3>long?</mark3><br>
Count it ten thousand trees <mark3>ago,</mark3><br>
five houses and ten thousand <mark4>trees,</mark4><br>
since the swallows exploded from Bowman <mark4>Tower</mark4><br>
over the place where the hermit <mark4>sang,</mark4><br>
while I held a fantail of squirming <mark4>roots</mark4><br>
that kissed the palm of my dirty <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
as if in reply to a <mark4>bird.</mark4><br>
The stranger who hammers No Trespass <mark4>signs</mark4><br>
to the staghorn sumac along the <mark1>road</mark1><br>
must think he owns this property.   <br>
I park my car below the curve <br>
and climbing over the tumbled <mark4>stones</mark4><br>
where the wild foxgrape <mark4>perseveres,</mark4><br>
I walk into the woods I <mark4>made,</mark4><br>
my dark and resinous, blistered <mark4>land,</mark4><br>
through the deep litter of the <mark3>years.</mark3><br>
