Title : Crossing the Atlantic <br>
Author : Anne Sexton <br><br>

We sail out of season into an oyster-gray <mark4>wind,</mark4><br>
over a terrible <mark4>hardness.</mark4><br>
Where Dickens crossed with mal de <mark3>mer</mark3><br>
in twenty weeks or twenty <mark4>days</mark4><br>
I cross toward him in five. <br>
Wrapped in <mark4>robes--</mark4><br>
not like Caesar but like liver with <mark4>bacon--</mark4><br>
I rest on the <mark4>stern</mark4><br>
burning my mouth with a wind-hot ash,   <br>
watching my ship <br>
bypass the <mark4>swells</mark4><br>
as easily as an old woman reads a <mark4>palm.</mark4><br>
I think, as I look North, that a field of <mark4>mules</mark4><br>
lay down to die. <br>
<br>
The ship is 27 hours <mark4>out.</mark4><br>
I have entered <mark3>her.</mark3><br>
She might be a whale, <br>
sleeping 2000 and ship's company, <br>
the last 40? martini <br>
and steel staterooms where night goes on forever.   <br>
Being inside them is, I <mark4>think,</mark4><br>
the way one would dig into a <mark4>planet</mark4><br>
and forget the word <mark4>light.</mark4><br>
I have walked <mark4>cities,</mark4><br>
miles of mole alleys with <mark4>carpets.</mark4><br>
Inside I have been ten girls who speak French.   <br>
They languish everywhere like bedsheets. <br>
<br>
Oh my Atlantic of the cracked <mark4>shores,</mark4><br>
those blemished gates of Rockport and Boothbay,   <br>
those harbor smells like the innards of <mark4>animals!</mark4><br>
Old childish Queen, where did you go, <br>
you bayer at wharfs and Victorian <mark4>houses?</mark4><br>
<br>
I have read each page of my mother's <mark1>voyage.</mark1><br>
I have read each page of her mother's <mark1>voyage.</mark1><br>
I have learned their words as they learned <mark4>Dickens'.</mark4><br>
I have swallowed these words like <mark4>bullets.</mark4><br>
But I have forgotten the last guest--terror.   <br>
Unlike them, I cannot toss in the <mark4>cabin</mark4><br>
as in childbirth. <br>
Now always leaving me in the <mark4>West</mark4><br>
is the <mark4>wake,</mark4><br>
a ragged bridal veil, <mark4>unexplained,</mark4><br>
seductive, always rushing down the <mark4>stairs,</mark4><br>
never detained, never enough. <br>
<br>
The ship goes <mark4>on</mark4><br>
as though nothing else were <mark4>happening.</mark4><br>
Generation after <mark4>generation,</mark4><br>
I go her way. <br>
She will run East, knot by knot, over an old <mark4>bloodstream,</mark4><br>
stripping it <mark4>clear,</mark4><br>
each hour ripping it, <mark1>pounding</mark1>, <mark4>pounding,</mark4><br>
forcing through as through a <mark4>virgin.</mark4><br>
Oh she is so <mark4>quick!</mark4><br>
This dead street never <mark4>stops!</mark4><br>
