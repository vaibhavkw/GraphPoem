Title : The Battle of Tel-el-Kebir <br>
Author : Knight of the White Elephant of Burmah William McGonagall <br><br>

Ye sons of Great Britain, come join with <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
And sing in praise of Sir Garnet Wolseley;<br>
Sound drums and trumpets <mark4>cheerfully,</mark4><br>
For he has acted most <mark4>heroically.</mark4><br>
<br>
Therefore loudly his praises <mark3>sing</mark3><br>
Until the hills their echoes back doth <mark3>ring;</mark3><br>
For he is a noble hero <mark3>bold,</mark3><br>
And an honour to his Queen and country, be it <mark3>told.</mark3><br>
<br>
He has gained for himself fame and <mark3>renown,</mark3><br>
Which to posterity will be handed <mark3>down;</mark3><br>
Because he has defeated Arabi by land and by <mark3>sea,</mark3><br>
And from the battle of Tel-el-Kebir he made him to <mark3>flee.</mark3><br>
<br>
With an army about fourteen thousand <mark4>strong,</mark4><br>
Through Egypt he did fearlessly march <mark3>along,</mark3><br>
With the gallant and brave Highland <mark4>brigade,</mark4><br>
To whom honour is due, be it <mark4>said.</mark4><br>
<br>
Arabi's army was about seventy thousand in <mark3>all,</mark3><br>
And, virtually speaking, it wasn't very <mark3>small;</mark3><br>
But if they had been as numerous <mark4>again,</mark4><br>
The Irish and Highland brigades would have beaten them, it is <mark3>plain.</mark3><br>
<br>
'Twas on the 13th day of September, in the year of 1882,<br>
Which Arabi and his rebel horde long will rue;<br>
Because Sir Garnet Wolseley and his brave little <mark4>band</mark4><br>
Fought and conquered them on Kebir <mark3>land.</mark3><br>
<br>
He marched upon the enemy with his gallant <mark1>band</mark1><br>
O'er the wild and lonely desert <mark3>sand,</mark3><br>
And attacked them before <mark4>daylight,</mark4><br>
And in twenty minutes he put them to <mark4>flight.</mark4><br>
<br>
The first shock of the attack was borne by the Second <mark1>Brigade,</mark1><br>
Who behaved most manfully, it is <mark1>said,</mark1><br>
Under the command of brave General Grahame,<br>
And have gained a lasting honour to their name.<br>
<br>
But Major Hart and the 18th Royal Irish, conjoint,<br>
Carried the trenches at the bayonet <mark4>point;</mark4><br>
Then the Marines chased them about four miles <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
At the charge of the bayonet, without <mark3>dismay!</mark3><br>
<br>
General Sir Archibald Alison led on the Highland <mark1>Brigade,</mark1><br>
Who never were the least <mark3>afraid.</mark3><br>
And such has been the case in this Egyptian <mark4>war,</mark4><br>
For at the charge of the bayonet they ran from them <mark4>afar!</mark4><br>
<br>
With their bagpipes playing, and one ringing <mark4>cheer,</mark4><br>
And the 42nd soon did the trenches <mark3>clear;</mark3><br>
Then hand to hand they did <mark3>engage,</mark3><br>
And fought like tigers in a <mark3>cage.</mark3><br>
<br>
Oh! it must have been a glorious <mark4>sight</mark4><br>
To see Sir Garnet Wolseley in the thickest of the <mark3>fight!</mark3><br>
In the midst of shot and shell, and the cannon's <mark4>roar,</mark4><br>
Whilst the dead and the dying lay weltering in their <mark3>gore.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then the Egyptians were forced to <mark4>yield,</mark4><br>
And the British were left masters of the <mark3>field;</mark3><br>
Then Arabi he did fret and <mark4>frown</mark4><br>
To see his army thus cut <mark1>down.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then Arabi the rebel took to <mark1>flight,</mark1><br>
And spurred his Arab steed with all his <mark3>might:</mark3><br>
With his heart full of despair and woe,<br>
And never halted till he reached Cairo.<br>
<br>
Now since the Egyptian war is at an <mark4>end,</mark4><br>
Let us thank God! Who did <mark3>send</mark3><br>
Sir Garnet Wolseley to crush and <mark4>kill</mark4><br>
Arabi and his rebel army at Kebir <mark3>hill.</mark3><br>
