Title : Finnish Opera <br>
Author : Barbara Guest <br><br>

Grass grew long in the <mark4>story.</mark4><br>
<br>
Pieces clung to bedclothes. In the night he believed he grew <mark4>taller.</mark4><br>
Grass covered the dream of a serpent, eyes sunk in his head, tail of silk clover. The dream translated into silver tone. More serpent heads and <mark4>the</mark4><br>
dream turned into an <mark4>opera.</mark4><br>
It was the opera that made the dreamer famous. Location of opera could <mark4>be</mark4><br>
<br>
in any country, could be Antarctica, more likely Finland, where they believe   <br>
in silk <mark4>clover</mark4>, it is gold in a land of starved desire for <mark4>summer.</mark4><br>
The opera had a clover leaf copied in porcelain by Aalto, the famous   <br>
<br>
designer, who sewed the clover leaf into a white curtain. He designed <mark3>a</mark3><br>
window for the man when he looks out to sea in his serpent <mark4>costume.</mark4><br>
This opera that begins with a dream traveled   <br>
<br>
to Rome and Zagreb, traveled across continents, once by camel. The travels became more famous <mark4>than</mark4><br>
the opera. People began to forget whether the grass really had grown long,   <br>
and where the serpent came <mark4>from.</mark4><br>
The opera was called by another name and included a gold <mark4>limousine.</mark4><br>
<br>
Somewhere in Oceania they added mermaid elves. <br>
