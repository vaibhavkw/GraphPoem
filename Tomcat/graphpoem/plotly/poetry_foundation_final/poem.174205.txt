Title : The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd <br>
Author : Sir Walter Ralegh <br><br>

If all the world and love were <mark3>young,</mark3><br>
And truth in every Shepherd's <mark3>tongue,</mark3><br>
These pretty pleasures might me <mark4>move,</mark4><br>
To live with thee, and be thy <mark4>love.</mark4><br>
<br>
Time drives the flocks from field to <mark3>fold,</mark3><br>
When Rivers rage and Rocks grow <mark3>cold,</mark3><br>
And Philomel becometh <mark3>dumb,</mark3><br>
The rest complains of cares to <mark3>come.</mark3><br>
<br>
The flowers do fade, and wanton <mark3>fields,</mark3><br>
To wayward winter reckoning <mark3>yields,</mark3><br>
A honey tongue, a heart of <mark3>gall,</mark3><br>
Is fancy's spring, but sorrow's <mark3>fall.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thy gowns, thy <mark4>shoes</mark4>, thy beds of <mark4>Roses,</mark4><br>
Thy cap, thy kirtle, and thy posies<br>
Soon break, soon wither, soon <mark3>forgotten:</mark3><br>
In folly ripe, in reason <mark3>rotten.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thy belt of straw and Ivy <mark4>buds,</mark4><br>
The Coral clasps and amber <mark3>studs,</mark3><br>
All these in me no means can <mark1>move</mark1><br>
To come to thee and be thy <mark1>love.</mark1><br>
<br>
But could youth last, and love still <mark4>breed,</mark4><br>
Had joys no date, nor age no <mark3>need,</mark3><br>
Then these delights my mind might <mark1>move</mark1><br>
To live with thee, and be thy <mark1>love.</mark1><br>
