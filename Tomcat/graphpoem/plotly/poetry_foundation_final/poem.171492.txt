Title : Buick <br>
Author : Karl Shapiro <br><br>

As a sloop with a sweep of immaculate wing on her delicate <mark4>spine</mark4><br>
And a keel as steel as a root that holds in the sea as she <mark4>leans,</mark4><br>
Leaning and laughing, my warm-hearted beauty, you <mark1>ride</mark1>, you <mark1>ride,</mark1><br>
You tack on the curves with parabola speed and a kiss of goodbye,<br>
Like a thoroughbred sloop, my new high-spirited spirit, my <mark4>kiss.</mark4><br>
<br>
As my foot suggests that you leap in the air with your hips of a girl,<br>
My finger that praises your wheel and announces your voices of song,<br>
Flouncing your skirts, you blueness of joy, you flirt of <mark4>politeness,</mark4><br>
You leap, you intelligence, essence of wheelness with silvery <mark4>nose,</mark4><br>
And your platinum clocks of excitement stir like the hairs of a <mark4>fern.</mark4><br>
<br>
But how alien you are from the booming belts of your birth and the smoke<br>
Where you turned on the stinging lathes of Detroit and Lansing at <mark4>night</mark4><br>
And shrieked at the torch in your secret parts and the amorous <mark4>tests,</mark4><br>
But now with your eyes that enter the future of roads you <mark4>forget;</mark4><br>
You are all instinct with your phosphorous glow and your streaking hair.<br>
<br>
And now when we stop it is not as the bird from the shell that I <mark5>leave</mark5><br>
Or the leathery pilot who steps from his bird with a sneer of <mark4>delight,</mark4><br>
And not as the ignorant beast do you squat and watch me <mark4>depart,</mark4><br>
But with exquisite breathing you smile, with satisfaction of <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
And I touch you again as you tick in the silence and settle in sleep.<br>
