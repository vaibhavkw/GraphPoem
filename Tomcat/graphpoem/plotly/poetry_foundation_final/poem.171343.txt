Title : A Room in the Past <br>
Author : Ted Kooser <br><br>

It's a kitchen. Its curtains <mark4>fill</mark4><br>
with a morning light so <mark4>bright</mark4><br>
you can't see beyond its <mark4>windows</mark4><br>
into the <mark4>afternoon</mark4>, A <mark4>kitchen</mark4><br>
falling through time with its <mark4>things</mark4><br>
in their places, the dishes jingling   <br>
up in the cupboard, the <mark4>bucket</mark4><br>
of drinking water rippled as if <br>
a truck had just gone past, but that <mark4>truck</mark4><br>
was thirty years. No one's at home   <br>
in this room. Its counter is <mark4>wiped,</mark4><br>
and the dishrag hangs from its <mark4>nail,</mark4><br>
a dry leaf. In housedresses of <mark4>mist,</mark4><br>
blue aprons of rain, my <mark4>grandmother</mark4><br>
moved through this life like a <mark4>ghost,</mark4><br>
and when she had finished her <mark4>years,</mark4><br>
she put them all back in their <mark4>places</mark4><br>
and wiped out the <mark4>sink</mark4>, turning her <mark4>back</mark4><br>
on the rest of us, <mark4>forever.</mark4><br>
