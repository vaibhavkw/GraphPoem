Title : God <br>
Author : Isaac Rosenberg <br><br>

In his malodorous brain what slugs and <mark4>mire,</mark4><br>
Lanthorned in his oblique eyes, guttering <mark4>burned!</mark4><br>
His body lodged a rat where men nursed <mark4>souls.</mark4><br>
The world flashed grape-green eyes of a foiled <mark4>cat</mark4><br>
To him. On fragments of an old shrunk <mark4>power,</mark4><br>
On shy and maimed, on women wrung <mark3>awry,</mark3><br>
He lay, a bullying hulk, to crush them <mark4>more.</mark4><br>
But when one, fearless, turned and clawed like <mark4>bronze,</mark4><br>
Cringing was easy to blunt these stern <mark4>paws,</mark4><br>
And he would weigh the heavier on those <mark4>after.</mark4><br>
<br>
Who rests in God's mean flattery now? Your wealth<br>
Is but his cunning to make death more <mark4>hard.</mark4><br>
Your iron sinews take more pain in <mark5>breaking.</mark5><br>
And he has made the market for your <mark4>beauty</mark4><br>
Too poor to buy, although you die to <mark4>sell.</mark4><br>
Only that he has never heard of sleep;<br>
And when the cats come out the rats are <mark3>sly.</mark3><br>
Here we are safe till he slinks in at dawn<br>
<br>
But he has gnawed a fibre from strange <mark4>roots,</mark4><br>
And in the morning some pale wonder <mark4>ceases.</mark4><br>
Things are not strange and strange things are <mark4>forgetful.</mark4><br>
Ah! if the day were arid, somehow <mark4>lost</mark4><br>
Out of <mark1>us</mark1>, but it is as hair of <mark4>us,</mark4><br>
And only in the hush no wind stirs <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
And in the light vague trouble lifts and <mark4>breathes,</mark4><br>
And restlessness still shadows the lost <mark4>ways.</mark4><br>
The fingers shut on voices that pass through,<br>
Where blind farewells are taken easily <mark4>....</mark4><br>
<br>
Ah! this miasma of a rotting <mark4>God!</mark4><br>
