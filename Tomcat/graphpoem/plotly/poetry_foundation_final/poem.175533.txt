Title : The Properly Scholarly Attitude <br>
Author : Adelaide Crapsey <br><br>

The poet pursues his beautiful <mark3>theme;</mark3><br>
The preacher his golden beatitude;<br>
And I run after a vanishing <mark3>dream--</mark3><br>
The glittering, will-o'-the-wispish <mark3>gleam</mark3><br>
Of the properly scholarly <mark1>attitude--</mark1><br>
The highly <mark4>desirable</mark4>, the very <mark4>advisable,</mark4><br>
The hardly acquirable, properly scholarly <mark1>attitude.</mark1><br>
<br>
I envy the savage without any <mark3>clothes,</mark3><br>
Who lives in a tropical <mark3>latitude;</mark3><br>
It's little of general culture he <mark3>knows.</mark3><br>
But then he escapes the worrisome <mark3>woes</mark3><br>
Of the properly scholarly <mark1>attitude--</mark1><br>
The unceasingly sighed <mark1>over</mark1>, wept over, cried <mark1>over,</mark1><br>
The futilely died over, properly scholarly <mark1>attitude.</mark1><br>
<br>
I work and I work till I nearly am <mark4>dead,</mark4><br>
And could say what the watchman said--that I <mark4>could!</mark4><br>
But still, with a sigh and a shake of the <mark4>head,</mark4><br>
"You don't <mark4>understand,</mark4>, it is ruthlessly <mark3>said,</mark3><br>
"The properly scholarly <mark1>attitude--</mark1><br>
The aye to be sought <mark1>for</mark1>, wrought for and fought <mark4>for,</mark4><br>
The ne'er to be caught for, properly scholarly <mark1>attitude--"</mark1><br>
<br>
I really am sometimes tempted to <mark3>say</mark3><br>
That it's merely a glittering <mark3>platitude;</mark3><br>
That people have just fallen into the <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
When lacking a subject, to tell of the <mark3>sway</mark3><br>
Of the properly scholarly <mark1>attitude--</mark1><br>
The easily preachable, spread-eagle speechable,<br>
In practice unreachable, properly scholarly <mark1>attitude.</mark1><br>
