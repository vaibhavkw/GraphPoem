Title : Love's Nocturn <br>
Author : Dante Gabriel Rossetti <br><br>

Master of the murmuring <mark3>courts</mark3><br>
Where the shapes of sleep <mark3>convene!--</mark3><br>
Lo! my spirit here <mark3>exhorts</mark3><br>
      All the powers of thy demesne <br>
For their aid to woo my <mark3>queen.</mark3><br>
What <mark3>reports</mark3><br>
Yield thy jealous courts <mark3>unseen?</mark3><br>
<br>
Vaporous, <mark4>unaccountable,</mark4><br>
Dreamland lies forlorn of <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
Hollow like a breathing <mark4>shell.</mark4><br>
Ah! that from all dreams I <mark3>might</mark3><br>
Choose one dream and guide its <mark3>flight!</mark3><br>
I know <mark3>well</mark3><br>
What her sleep should tell <mark3>to-night.</mark3><br>
<br>
There the dreams are <mark4>multitudes:</mark4><br>
Some that will not wait for <mark3>sleep,</mark3><br>
Deep within the August <mark4>woods;</mark4><br>
Some that hum while rest may <mark3>steep</mark3><br>
Weary labour laid <mark3>a-heap;</mark3><br>
<br>
Some, of grievous moods that <mark3>weep.</mark3><br>
<br>
Poets' fancies all are <mark3>there:</mark3><br>
There the elf-girls flood with <mark4>wings</mark4><br>
Valleys full of plaintive <mark3>air;</mark3><br>
There breathe <mark4>perfumes</mark4>, there in <mark3>rings</mark3><br>
Whirl the foam-bewildered <mark3>springs;</mark3><br>
Siren <mark1>there</mark1><br>
Winds her dizzy hair and <mark3>sings.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thence the one dream <mark4>mutually</mark4><br>
Dreamed in bridal <mark4>unison,</mark4><br>
Less than waking <mark4>ecstasy;</mark4><br>
Half-formed visions that make <mark4>moan</mark4><br>
In the house of birth <mark3>alone;</mark3><br>
          And what we <br>
At death's wicket see, <mark3>unknown.</mark3><br>
<br>
But for mine own sleep, it <mark4>lies</mark4><br>
In one gracious form's <mark4>control,</mark4><br>
Fair with honourable <mark3>eyes,</mark3><br>
Lamps of a translucent <mark3>soul:</mark3><br>
O their glance is loftiest <mark3>dole,</mark3><br>
Sweet and <mark3>wise,</mark3><br>
Wherein Love descries his <mark3>goal.</mark3><br>
<br>
Reft of her, my dreams are <mark4>all</mark4><br>
Clammy trance that fears the <mark3>sky:</mark3><br>
Changing footpaths shift and <mark3>fall;</mark3><br>
From polluted coverts <mark3>nigh,</mark3><br>
Miserable phantoms <mark3>sigh;</mark3><br>
Quakes the <mark3>pall,</mark3><br>
And the funeral goes <mark3>by.</mark3><br>
<br>
Master, is it soothly <mark4>said</mark4><br>
That, as echoes of man's <mark3>speech</mark3><br>
Far in secret clefts are <mark4>made,</mark4><br>
So do all men's bodies <mark3>reach</mark3><br>
Shadows o'er thy sunken <mark3>beach,--</mark3><br>
Shape or <mark3>shade</mark3><br>
In those halls pourtrayed of <mark3>each?</mark3><br>
<br>
Ah! might I, by thy good <mark4>grace</mark4><br>
Groping in the windy <mark3>stair,</mark3><br>
(Darkness and the breath of <mark3>space</mark3><br>
Like loud waters <mark4>everywhere,)</mark4><br>
Meeting mine own image <mark1>there</mark1><br>
Face to <mark3>face,</mark3><br>
Send it from that place to <mark3>her!</mark3><br>
<br>
Nay, not I; but oh! do <mark3>thou,</mark3><br>
Master, from thy <mark5>shadowkind</mark5><br>
Call my body's phantom <mark3>now:</mark3><br>
      Bid it bear its face declin'd <br>
Till its flight her slumbers <mark4>find,</mark4><br>
And her <mark3>brow</mark3><br>
Feel its presence bow like <mark3>wind.</mark3><br>
<br>
Where in groves the gracile <mark4>Spring</mark4><br>
      Trembles, with mute orison <br>
Confidently <mark4>strengthening,</mark4><br>
Water's voice and wind's as <mark4>one</mark4><br>
Shed an echo in the <mark3>sun.</mark3><br>
Soft as <mark1>Spring,</mark1><br>
Master, bid it sing and <mark1>moan.</mark1><br>
<br>
Song shall tell how glad and <mark4>strong</mark4><br>
      Is the night she soothes alway; <br>
Moan shall grieve with that parched <mark4>tongue</mark4><br>
Of the brazen hours of <mark3>day:</mark3><br>
Sounds as of the springtide <mark3>they,</mark3><br>
Moan and <mark4>song,</mark4><br>
While the chill months long for <mark3>May.</mark3><br>
<br>
Not the prayers which with all <mark4>leave</mark4><br>
The world's fluent woes <mark3>prefer,--</mark3><br>
Not the praise the world doth <mark4>give,</mark4><br>
      Dulcet fulsome whisperer;-- <br>
Let it yield my love to <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
And <mark4>achieve</mark4><br>
Strength that shall not grieve or <mark3>err.</mark3><br>
<br>
Wheresoe'er my dreams <mark3>befall,</mark3><br>
Both at night-watch, (let it <mark3>say,)</mark3><br>
And where round the <mark4>sundial</mark4><br>
The reluctant hours of <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
Heartless, hopeless of their <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
Rest and <mark4>call;--</mark4><br>
There her glance doth fall and <mark3>stay.</mark3><br>
<br>
Suddenly her face is <mark1>there:</mark1><br>
      So do mounting vapours wreathe <br>
Subtle-scented transports <mark3>where</mark3><br>
The black firwood sets its <mark3>teeth.</mark3><br>
Part the boughs and look <mark3>beneath,--</mark3><br>
Lilies <mark3>share</mark3><br>
Secret waters there, and <mark5>breathe.</mark5><br>
<br>
Master, bid my shadow <mark4>bend</mark4><br>
Whispering thus till birth of <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
Lest new shapes that sleep may <mark3>send</mark3><br>
Scatter all its work to <mark1>flight;--</mark1><br>
Master, master of the <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
Bid it <mark3>spend</mark3><br>
      Speech, song, prayer, and end aright. <br>
<br>
Yet, ah me! if at her <mark4>head</mark4><br>
There another phantom <mark4>lean</mark4><br>
Murmuring o'er the fragrant <mark3>bed,--</mark3><br>
Ah! and if my spirit's <mark1>queen</mark1><br>
Smile those alien prayers <mark3>between,--</mark3><br>
Ah! poor <mark1>shade!</mark1><br>
Shall it strive, or fade <mark1>unseen?</mark1><br>
<br>
   How should love's own messenger <br>
Strive with love and be love's <mark3>foe?</mark3><br>
Master, nay! If thus, in <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
Sleep a wedded heart should <mark3>show,--</mark3><br>
Silent let mine image <mark3>go,</mark3><br>
Its old <mark1>share</mark1><br>
Of thy spell-bound air to <mark3>know.</mark3><br>
<br>
Like a vapour wan and <mark4>mute,</mark4><br>
Like a flame, so let it <mark4>pass;</mark4><br>
One low sigh across her <mark3>lute,</mark3><br>
One dull breath against her <mark3>glass;</mark3><br>
And to my sad soul, <mark3>alas!</mark3><br>
One <mark3>salute</mark3><br>
Cold as when Death's foot shall <mark1>pass.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then, too, let all hopes of <mark4>mine,</mark4><br>
All vain hopes by night and <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
Slowly at thy summoning <mark3>sign</mark3><br>
Rise up pallid and <mark3>obey.</mark3><br>
Dreams, if this is thus, were <mark1>they:--</mark1><br>
Be they <mark3>thine,</mark3><br>
And to dreamworld pine <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
<br>
Yet from old time, life, not <mark4>death,</mark4><br>
Master, in thy rule is <mark3>rife:</mark3><br>
Lo! through thee, with mingling <mark3>breath,</mark3><br>
Adam woke beside his <mark3>wife.</mark3><br>
O Love bring me so, for <mark3>strife,</mark3><br>
Force and <mark4>faith,</mark4><br>
Bring me so not death but <mark3>life!</mark3><br>
<br>
Yea, to Love himself is <mark4>pour'd</mark4><br>
This frail song of hope and <mark4>fear.</mark4><br>
Thou art Love, of one <mark4>accord</mark4><br>
With kind Sleep to bring her <mark3>near,</mark3><br>
Still-eyed, deep-eyed, ah how <mark3>dear.</mark3><br>
Master, <mark3>Lord,</mark3><br>
In her name implor'd, O <mark4>hear!</mark4><br>
