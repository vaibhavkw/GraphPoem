Title : Number Man<br>
Author : Carl Sandburg<br><br>

(for the ghost of Johann Sebastian <mark4>Bach)</mark4><br>
He was born to wonder about <mark4>numbers.</mark4><br>
<br>
He balanced fives against <mark4>tens</mark4><br>
and made them sleep <mark4>together</mark4><br>
and love each <mark4>other.</mark4><br>
<br>
He took sixes and <mark4>sevens</mark4><br>
and set them wrangling and <mark4>fighting</mark4><br>
over raw <mark4>bones.</mark4><br>
<br>
He woke up twos and <mark4>fours</mark4><br>
out of baby <mark1>sleep</mark1><br>
and touched them back to <mark1>sleep.</mark1><br>
<br>
He mananged eights and <mark4>nines,</mark4><br>
gave them prophet <mark4>beards,</mark4><br>
marched them into mists and <mark4>mountains.</mark4><br>
<br>
He added all the numbers he knew,<br>
multiplied them by new-found <mark1>numbers</mark1><br>
and called it a prayer of <mark1>Numbers.</mark1><br>
<br>
For each of a million cipher <mark4>silences</mark4><br>
he dug up a mate <mark4>number</mark4><br>
for a candle light in the <mark4>dark.</mark4><br>
<br>
He knew love <mark1>numbers</mark1>, luck <mark1>numbers,</mark1><br>
how the sea and the <mark4>stars</mark4><br>
are made and held by <mark1>numbers.</mark1><br>
<br>
He died from the wonder of <mark4>numbering.</mark4><br>
He said good-by as if good-by is a <mark1>number.</mark1><br>
