Title : Bat Cave <br>
Author : Eleanor Wilner <br><br>

The cave looked much like any <mark4>other</mark4><br>
from a little distance <mark4>but</mark4><br>
as we <mark4>approached</mark4>, came <mark4>almost</mark4><br>
to its mouth, we saw its walls <mark5>within</mark5><br>
that slanted up into a <mark4>dome</mark4><br>
were beating like a wild black <mark4>lung--</mark4><br>
it was plastered and hung <mark5>with</mark5><br>
the pulsing bodies of bats, the <mark4>organ</mark4><br>
music of the body's deep <br>
interior, <mark4>alive</mark4>, the sacred <mark4>cave</mark4><br>
with its ten thousand gleaming <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
near the clustered <mark4>rocks</mark4><br>
where the sea beat with the <mark4>leather</mark4><br>
wings of its own dark <mark4>waves.</mark4><br>
<br>
Below the bat-hung, throbbing <mark4>walls,</mark4><br>
an altar stood, glittering with guano,   <br>
a stucco sculpture like a Gaudi <br>
church, <mark4>berserk</mark4><br>
Baroque, stone translated <mark1>into</mark1><br>
flux--murk and mud and the <mark4>floral</mark4><br>
extravagance of wet sand <mark4>dripped</mark4><br>
from a giant hand, giving <mark4>back</mark4><br>
blessing, excrement--return <br>
for the first fruits offered to the <mark4>gods.</mark4><br>
<br>
We stayed outside, <mark4>superior</mark4><br>
with fear, like <mark4>tourists</mark4><br>
peering through a door, whose <mark4>hanging</mark4><br>
beads rattle in the air <mark4>from</mark4><br>
one who disappeared into the <mark4>dim</mark4><br>
interior; we thought of the <mark4>caves</mark4><br>
of Marabar, of a writer who <mark4>entered</mark4><br>
and never quite <mark4>emerged--</mark4><br>
the caves' echoing <mark3>black</mark3><br>
emptiness a tunnel in the English   <br>
soul where he is wandering still. So   <br>
the bat cave on the Bali coast, not <mark3>far</mark3><br>
from Denpasar, holds us off, and beckons <mark4>...</mark4><br>
<br>
Standing there now, at the <mark4>mouth</mark4><br>
of the cave--this time we enter, <mark4>feel</mark4><br>
inside the flutter of <mark4>those</mark4><br>
many hearts, the radiant heat of <mark4>pumping</mark4><br>
veins, the stretch of wing on <mark4>bone</mark4><br>
like a benediction, and the <mark4>familiar</mark4><br>
faces of this many-headed <mark4>god,</mark4><br>
benevolent as night <mark4>is</mark4><br>
to the weary--the way at <mark4>dark</mark4><br>
the cave releases them <mark4>all,</mark4><br>
how they must lift like the <mark4>foam</mark4><br>
on a wave breaking, how <mark4>many</mark4><br>
they are as they <mark4>enter</mark4><br>
the starlit air, and <mark4>scatter</mark4><br>
in wild wide <mark4>arcs</mark4><br>
in search of fruit, the sweet <mark4>bites</mark4><br>
of mosquito ... <br>
<br>
while the great domes of <mark4>our</mark4><br>
own kind slide open, the <mark5>eye</mark5><br>
that <mark4>watches</mark4>, tracks the <mark4>skies,</mark4><br>
and the huge doors roll slowly <mark1>back</mark1><br>
on the <mark4>hangars</mark4>, the <mark4>planes</mark4><br>
push out their noses of <mark4>steel,</mark4><br>
their wings a bright <mark5>alloy</mark5><br>
of aluminum and death, they <mark4>roar</mark4><br>
down the runways, tear <mark1>into</mark1><br>
the night, their heavy bodies <mark4>fueled</mark4><br>
from sucking at the <mark4>hidden</mark4><br>
veins of earth; they leave a trail of <mark4>fire</mark4><br>
behind them as they <mark4>scar</mark4><br>
the air, filling the <mark4>dreams</mark4><br>
of children, <mark5>sleeping--anywhere,</mark5><br>
Chicago, Baghdad--with <mark4>blood,</mark4><br>
as the bombs drop, as the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
splits open, as the <mark4>mothers</mark4><br>
reach for their <mark4>own</mark4><br>
in the night of the <mark4>falling</mark4><br>
sky, madness <mark4>in</mark4><br>
method, nature <mark4>gone</mark4><br>
into reverse <mark4>...</mark4><br>
<br>
here, nearly <mark4>unperturbed,</mark4><br>
the bats from the sacred <mark1>cave</mark1><br>
fill the night with their <mark4>calls,</mark4><br>
high-pitched, tuned to the solid <mark1>world</mark1><br>
as eyes to the spectrum of light, <mark4>gnats</mark4><br>
to the glow of a lamp--the <mark3>bats</mark3><br>
<mark4>circle</mark4>, the clouds <mark3>wheel,</mark3><br>
the earth <mark4>turns</mark4><br>
pulling the dome of <mark4>stars</mark4><br>
among the spinning trees, <mark4>blurring</mark4><br>
the sweet globes of <mark4>fruit</mark4>, <mark4>shaped</mark4><br>
exactly to desire--dizzy, we <mark4>swing</mark4><br>
back to the cave on our stiff <mark1>dark</mark1><br>
wings, the sweet juice of <mark4>papaya</mark4><br>
drying on our jaws, <mark3>home</mark3><br>
to the cave, to attach <mark4>ourselves</mark4><br>
back to the pulsing dome, <mark4>until,</mark4><br>
hanging there, sated and <mark4>sleepy,</mark4><br>
we can see what was once our <mark1>world</mark1><br>
upside down as it <mark1>is</mark1><br>
and wonder whose <mark4>altars</mark4><br>
those are, <mark4>white,</mark4><br>
encrusted with <mark4>shit.</mark4><br>
