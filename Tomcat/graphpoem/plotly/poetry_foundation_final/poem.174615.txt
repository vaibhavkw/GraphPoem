Title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 95 <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

By night we linger'd on the <mark3>lawn,</mark3><br>
For underfoot the herb was <mark3>dry;</mark3><br>
And genial warmth; and o'er the <mark3>sky</mark3><br>
The silvery haze of summer <mark3>drawn;</mark3><br>
<br>
And calm that let the tapers <mark4>burn</mark4><br>
         Unwavering: not a cricket chirr'd: <br>
The brook alone far-off was <mark4>heard,</mark4><br>
And on the board the fluttering <mark3>urn:</mark3><br>
<br>
And bats went round in fragrant <mark3>skies,</mark3><br>
And wheel'd or lit the filmy <mark3>shapes</mark3><br>
That haunt the dusk, with ermine <mark3>capes</mark3><br>
And woolly breasts and beaded <mark3>eyes;</mark3><br>
<br>
While now we sang old songs that <mark4>peal'd</mark4><br>
From knoll to knoll, where, couch'd at <mark4>ease,</mark4><br>
The white kine <mark4>glimmer'd</mark4>, and the <mark3>trees</mark3><br>
Laid their dark arms about the <mark4>field.</mark4><br>
<br>
But when those others, one by <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
Withdrew themselves from me and <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
And in the house light after <mark3>light</mark3><br>
Went out, and I was all <mark4>alone,</mark4><br>
<br>
A hunger seized my heart; I <mark4>read</mark4><br>
Of that glad year which once had <mark4>been,</mark4><br>
In those fall'n leaves which kept their <mark4>green,</mark4><br>
The noble letters of the <mark3>dead:</mark3><br>
<br>
And strangely on the silence <mark3>broke</mark3><br>
The silent-speaking words, and <mark3>strange</mark3><br>
Was love's dumb cry defying <mark3>change</mark3><br>
To test his worth; and strangely <mark3>spoke</mark3><br>
<br>
The faith, the vigour, bold to <mark3>dwell</mark3><br>
On doubts that drive the coward <mark4>back,</mark4><br>
And keen thro' wordy snares to <mark3>track</mark3><br>
Suggestion to her inmost <mark3>cell.</mark3><br>
<br>
So word by word, and line by <mark4>line,</mark4><br>
The dead man touch'd me from the <mark4>past,</mark4><br>
And all at once it seem'd at <mark3>last</mark3><br>
The living soul was flash'd on <mark3>mine,</mark3><br>
<br>
And mine in this was wound, and <mark4>whirl'd</mark4><br>
About empyreal heights of <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
And came on that which is, and <mark3>caught</mark3><br>
The deep pulsations of the <mark4>world,</mark4><br>
<br>
AEonian music measuring <mark4>out</mark4><br>
The steps of Time--the shocks of <mark4>Chance--</mark4><br>
The blows of Death. At length my <mark3>trance</mark3><br>
Was cancell'd, stricken thro' with <mark3>doubt.</mark3><br>
<br>
Vague words! but ah, how hard to <mark3>frame</mark3><br>
In matter-moulded forms of <mark3>speech,</mark3><br>
Or ev'n for intellect to <mark3>reach</mark3><br>
Thro' memory that which I <mark3>became:</mark3><br>
<br>
Till now the doubtful dusk <mark4>reveal'd</mark4><br>
The knolls once more where, couch'd at <mark1>ease,</mark1><br>
The white kine <mark4>glimmer'd</mark4>, and the <mark1>trees</mark1><br>
Laid their dark arms about the <mark1>field:</mark1><br>
<br>
And suck'd from out the distant <mark4>gloom</mark4><br>
A breeze began to tremble <mark4>o'er</mark4><br>
         The large leaves of the sycamore, <br>
And fluctuate all the still <mark3>perfume,</mark3><br>
<br>
And gathering freshlier <mark4>overhead,</mark4><br>
Rock'd the full-foliaged elms, and <mark3>swung</mark3><br>
The heavy-folded rose, and <mark3>flung</mark3><br>
The lilies to and fro, and <mark3>said</mark3><br>
<br>
"The dawn, the dawn," and died <mark3>away;</mark3><br>
And East and West, without a <mark3>breath,</mark3><br>
Mixt their dim lights, like life and <mark3>death,</mark3><br>
To broaden into boundless <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
