Title : Amoretti LXXIV: Most Happy Letters <br>
Author : Edmund Spenser <br><br>

Most happy letters, fram'd by skilful <mark3>trade,</mark3><br>
With which that happy name was first <mark5>design'd:</mark5><br>
The which three times thrice happy hath me <mark3>made,</mark3><br>
With gifts of body, fortune, and of <mark4>mind.</mark4><br>
The first my being to me gave by <mark3>kind,</mark3><br>
From mother's womb deriv'd by due <mark5>descent,</mark5><br>
The second is my sovereign Queen most <mark1>kind,</mark1><br>
That honour and large richesse to me <mark3>lent.</mark3><br>
The third my love, my life's last <mark4>ornament,</mark4><br>
By whom my spirit out of dust was <mark4>raised:</mark4><br>
To speak her praise and glory <mark4>excellent,</mark4><br>
Of all alive most worthy to be <mark3>praised.</mark3><br>
Ye three Elizabeths for ever <mark3>live,</mark3><br>
That three such graces did unto me <mark3>give.</mark3><br>
