Title : King Bee Blues <br>
Author : George Elliott Clarke <br><br>

I'm an ol' king bee, <mark4>honey,</mark4><br>
Buzzin' from flower to <mark1>flower.</mark1><br>
I'm an ol' king bee, sweets,<br>
Hummin' from flower to <mark1>flower.</mark1><br>
Women got good <mark4>pollen;</mark4><br>
I get some every <mark3>hour.</mark3><br>
<br>
There's Lily in the <mark4>valley</mark4><br>
And sweet honeysuckle Rose <mark1>too;</mark1><br>
There's Lily in the <mark1>valley</mark1><br>
And sweet honeysuckle Rose <mark1>too.</mark1><br>
And there's pretty black-eyed <mark4>Susan,</mark4><br>
Perfect as the night is <mark3>blue.</mark3><br>
<br>
You don't have to <mark1>trust</mark1><br>
A single, black word I <mark1>say.</mark1><br>
You don't have to <mark1>trust</mark1><br>
A single, black word I <mark1>say.</mark1><br>
But don't be surprised<br>
If I sting your flower <mark3>today.</mark3><br>
