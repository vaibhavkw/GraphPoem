Title : I Saw a Chapel <br>
Author : William Blake <br><br>

I saw a chapel all of gold <br>
That none did dare to enter <mark4>in</mark4><br>
And many weeping stood <mark4>without</mark4><br>
Weeping mourning worshipping<br>
<br>
I saw a serpent rise <mark4>between</mark4><br>
The white pillars of the <mark3>door</mark3><br>
And he forcd & forcd & forcd <br>
Down the golden hinges <mark3>tore</mark3><br>
<br>
And along the pavement <mark4>sweet</mark4><br>
Set with pearls and rubies <mark4>bright</mark4><br>
All his slimy length he drew <br>
Till upon the altar <mark3>white</mark3><br>
<br>
Vomiting his poison <mark4>out</mark4><br>
On the bread & on the <mark4>wine</mark4><br>
So I turnd into a sty <br>
And laid me down among the <mark3>swine</mark3><br>
