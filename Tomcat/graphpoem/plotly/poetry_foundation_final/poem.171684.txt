Title : My Shoes <br>
Author : Charles Simic <br><br>

Shoes, secret face of my inner <mark1>life:</mark1><br>
Two gaping toothless <mark4>mouths,</mark4><br>
Two partly decomposed animal <mark4>skins</mark4><br>
Smelling of mice <mark4>nests.</mark4><br>
<br>
My brother and sister who died at <mark3>birth</mark3><br>
Continuing their existence in you, <br>
Guiding my <mark1>life</mark1><br>
Toward their incomprehensible <mark4>innocence.</mark4><br>
<br>
What use are books to me <br>
When in you it is possible to read   <br>
The Gospel of my life on <mark3>earth</mark3><br>
And still beyond, of things to come? <br>
<br>
I want to proclaim the <mark4>religion</mark4><br>
I have devised for your perfect humility   <br>
And the strange church I am <mark4>building</mark4><br>
With you as the altar. <br>
<br>
Ascetic and maternal, you endure: <br>
Kin to oxen, to Saints, to condemned <mark4>men,</mark4><br>
With your mute patience, <mark4>forming</mark4><br>
The only true likeness of <mark4>myself.</mark4><br>
