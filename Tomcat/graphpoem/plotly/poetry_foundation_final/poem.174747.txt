Title : When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer <br>
Author : Walt Whitman <br><br>

When I heard the learn'd astronomer, <br>
When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me, <br>
When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure <mark4>them,</mark4><br>
When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the <mark4>lecture-room,</mark4><br>
How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick, <br>
Till rising and gliding out I wander'd off by myself, <br>
In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars.<br>
