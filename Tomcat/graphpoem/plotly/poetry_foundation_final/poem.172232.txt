Title : Echo <br>
Author : Daryl Hine <br><br>

Echo that loved hid within a <mark4>wood</mark4><br>
Would to herself rehearse her weary <mark3>woe:</mark3><br>
O, she <mark4>cried</mark4>, and all the rest <mark4>unsaid</mark4><br>
Identical came back in sorry echo. <br>
<br>
Echo for the fix that she was <mark4>in</mark4><br>
Invisible, distraught by mocking <mark4>passion,</mark4><br>
Passionate, ignored, as good as dumb,   <br>
Employed that O unchanged in <mark4>repetition.</mark4><br>
<br>
Shun love if you suspect that he shuns you,   <br>
Use with him no reproaches <mark4>whatsoever.</mark4><br>
Ever you knew, supposing him to <mark3>know</mark3><br>
No melody from which you might <mark4>recover-</mark4><br>
<br>
Cover your ears, dear Echo, do not <mark4>hear.</mark4><br>
Here is no supplication but your <mark4>own,</mark4><br>
Only your sighs return upon the <mark4>air</mark4><br>
Ere their music from the mouth be <mark4>gone.</mark4><br>
