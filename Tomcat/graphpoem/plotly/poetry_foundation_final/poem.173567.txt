Title : Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat Drowned in a Tub of Goldfishes <br>
Author : Thomas Gray <br><br>

'Twas on a lofty vase's <mark3>side,</mark3><br>
Where China's gayest art had <mark3>dyed</mark3><br>
The azure flowers that <mark3>blow;</mark3><br>
Demurest of the tabby <mark4>kind,</mark4><br>
The pensive Selima, <mark3>reclined,</mark3><br>
Gazed on the lake <mark3>below.</mark3><br>
<br>
Her conscious tail her joy <mark4>declared;</mark4><br>
The fair round face, the snowy <mark4>beard,</mark4><br>
The velvet of her <mark4>paws,</mark4><br>
Her coat, that with the tortoise <mark4>vies,</mark4><br>
Her ears of jet, and emerald <mark3>eyes,</mark3><br>
She saw; and purred <mark4>applause.</mark4><br>
<br>
Still had she <mark4>gazed</mark4>, but 'midst the <mark4>tide</mark4><br>
Two angel forms were seen to <mark3>glide,</mark3><br>
The genii of the <mark3>stream;</mark3><br>
Their scaly armour's Tyrian <mark3>hue</mark3><br>
Through richest purple to the <mark3>view</mark3><br>
Betrayed a golden <mark3>gleam.</mark3><br>
<br>
The hapless nymph with wonder <mark3>saw;</mark3><br>
A whisker first and then a <mark3>claw,</mark3><br>
With many an ardent <mark3>wish,</mark3><br>
She stretched in vain to reach the <mark4>prize.</mark4><br>
What female heart can gold <mark3>despise?</mark3><br>
What cat's averse to <mark3>fish?</mark3><br>
<br>
Presumptuous maid! with looks <mark3>intent</mark3><br>
Again she stretch'd, again she <mark3>bent,</mark3><br>
Nor knew the gulf <mark4>between.</mark4><br>
(Malignant Fate sat by, and <mark4>smiled)</mark4><br>
The slippery verge her feet <mark3>beguiled,</mark3><br>
She tumbled headlong <mark4>in.</mark4><br>
Eight times emerging from the <mark4>flood</mark4><br>
She mewed to every watery <mark4>god,</mark4><br>
Some speedy aid to <mark4>send.</mark4><br>
No dolphin came, no Nereid <mark4>stirred;</mark4><br>
Nor cruel Tom, nor Susan <mark3>heard;</mark3><br>
A Favourite has no <mark4>friend!</mark4><br>
<br>
From hence, ye beauties, undeceived,<br>
Know, one false step is ne'er <mark4>retrieved,</mark4><br>
And be with caution <mark4>bold.</mark4><br>
Not all that tempts your wandering <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
And heedless hearts, is lawful <mark1>prize;</mark1><br>
Nor all that glisters, <mark3>gold.</mark3><br>
