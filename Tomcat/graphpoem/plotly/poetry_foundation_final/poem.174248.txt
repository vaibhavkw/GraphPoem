Title : Richard Cory <br>
Author : Edwin Arlington Robinson <br><br>

Whenever Richard Cory went down <mark3>town,</mark3><br>
We people on the pavement looked at <mark3>him:</mark3><br>
He was a gentleman from sole to <mark3>crown,</mark3><br>
Clean favored, and imperially <mark3>slim.</mark3><br>
<br>
And he was always quietly <mark4>arrayed,</mark4><br>
And he was always human when he <mark3>talked;</mark3><br>
But still he fluttered pulses when he <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
"Good-morning," and he glittered when he <mark3>walked.</mark3><br>
<br>
And he was rich--yes, richer than a <mark4>king--</mark4><br>
And admirably schooled in every <mark3>grace:</mark3><br>
In fine, we thought that he was <mark4>everything</mark4><br>
To make us wish that we were in his <mark3>place.</mark3><br>
<br>
So on we <mark4>worked</mark4>, and waited for the <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
And went without the meat, and cursed the <mark3>bread;</mark3><br>
And Richard Cory, one calm summer <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
Went home and put a bullet through his <mark3>head.</mark3><br>
