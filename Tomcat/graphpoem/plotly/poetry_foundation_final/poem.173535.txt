Title : Range-finding <br>
Author : Robert Frost <br><br>

The battle rent a cobweb <mark3>diamond-strung</mark3><br>
And cut a flower beside a ground bird's <mark3>nest</mark3><br>
Before it stained a single human <mark3>breast.</mark3><br>
The stricken flower bent double and so <mark3>hung.</mark3><br>
And still the bird revisited her <mark3>young.</mark3><br>
A butterfly its fall had <mark3>dispossessed</mark3><br>
A moment sought in air his flower of <mark3>rest,</mark3><br>
Then lightly stooped to it and fluttering <mark3>clung.</mark3><br>
<br>
On the bare upland pasture there had <mark3>spread</mark3><br>
O'ernight 'twixt mullein stalks a wheel of <mark3>thread</mark3><br>
And straining cables wet with silver <mark3>dew.</mark3><br>
A sudden passing bullet shook it <mark3>dry.</mark3><br>
The indwelling spider ran to greet the <mark3>fly,</mark3><br>
But finding nothing, sullenly <mark3>withdrew.</mark3><br>
