Title : An Essay on Criticism: Part 3 <br>
Author : Alexander Pope <br><br>

Learn then what morals critics ought to <mark3>show,</mark3><br>
For 'tis but half a judge's task, to <mark3>know.</mark3><br>
'Tis not enough, taste, judgment, learning, <mark4>join;</mark4><br>
In all you speak, let truth and candour <mark4>shine:</mark4><br>
That not alone what to your sense is <mark3>due,</mark3><br>
All may allow; but seek your friendship <mark3>too.</mark3><br>
<br>
Be silent always when you doubt your <mark1>sense;</mark1><br>
And speak, though sure, with seeming diffidence:<br>
Some positive, persisting fops we <mark1>know,</mark1><br>
Who, if once wrong, will needs be always <mark3>so;</mark3><br>
But you, with pleasure own your errors <mark3>past,</mark3><br>
And make each day a critic on the <mark3>last.</mark3><br>
<br>
'Tis not enough, your counsel still be <mark3>true;</mark3><br>
Blunt truths more mischief than nice falsehoods <mark3>do;</mark3><br>
Men must be taught as if you taught them <mark4>not;</mark4><br>
And things unknown proposed as things <mark3>forgot.</mark3><br>
Without good breeding, truth is disapprov'd;<br>
That only makes superior sense <mark4>belov'd.</mark4><br>
<br>
       Be niggards of advice on no pretence;<br>
For the worst avarice is that of <mark1>sense.</mark1><br>
With mean complacence ne'er betray your <mark4>trust,</mark4><br>
Nor be so civil as to prove <mark3>unjust.</mark3><br>
Fear not the anger of the wise to <mark4>raise;</mark4><br>
Those best can bear reproof, who merit <mark3>praise.</mark3><br>
<br>
'Twere well might critics still this freedom <mark4>take,</mark4><br>
But Appius reddens at each word you <mark4>speak,</mark4><br>
And stares,  Tremendous ! with a threatening <mark3>eye,</mark3><br>
Like some fierce tyrant in old <mark4>tapestry!</mark4><br>
Fear most to tax an honourable <mark4>fool,</mark4><br>
Whose right it is, uncensur'd, to be <mark4>dull;</mark4><br>
Such, without wit, are poets when they <mark4>please,</mark4><br>
As without learning they can take <mark3>degrees.</mark3><br>
Leave dangerous truths to unsuccessful <mark4>satires,</mark4><br>
And flattery to fulsome dedicators,<br>
Whom, when they praise, the world believes no <mark4>more,</mark4><br>
Than when they promise to give scribbling <mark4>o'er.</mark4><br>
'Tis best sometimes your censure to <mark4>restrain,</mark4><br>
And charitably let the dull be <mark3>vain:</mark3><br>
Your silence there is better than your <mark4>spite,</mark4><br>
For who can rail so long as they can <mark3>write?</mark3><br>
Still humming on, their drowsy course they <mark3>keep,</mark3><br>
And lash'd so long, like tops, are lash'd <mark3>asleep.</mark3><br>
False steps but help them to renew the <mark4>race,</mark4><br>
As after stumbling, jades will mend their <mark3>pace.</mark3><br>
What crowds of these, impenitently <mark3>bold,</mark3><br>
In sounds and jingling syllables grown <mark3>old,</mark3><br>
Still run on poets, in a raging <mark2>vein,</mark2><br>
Even to the dregs and squeezings of the <mark3>brain,</mark3><br>
Strain out the last, dull droppings of their <mark1>sense,</mark1><br>
And rhyme with all the rage of <mark4>impotence!</mark4><br>
<br>
Such shameless bards we have; and yet 'tis <mark1>true,</mark1><br>
There are as mad, abandon'd critics <mark1>too.</mark1><br>
The bookful <mark4>blockhead</mark4>, ignorantly <mark4>read,</mark4><br>
With loads of learned lumber in his <mark3>head,</mark3><br>
With his own tongue still edifies his <mark4>ears,</mark4><br>
And always list'ning to himself <mark3>appears.</mark3><br>
All books he <mark4>reads</mark4>, and all he reads <mark4>assails,</mark4><br>
From Dryden's Fables down to Durfey's <mark3>Tales.</mark3><br>
With him, most authors steal their works, or <mark3>buy;</mark3><br>
Garth did not write his own  Dispensary <mark4>.</mark4><br>
Name a new play, and he's the poet's <mark4>friend,</mark4><br>
Nay show'd his faults?but when would poets <mark3>mend?</mark3><br>
No place so sacred from such fops is <mark4>barr'd,</mark4><br>
Nor is Paul's church more safe than Paul's <mark4>churchyard:</mark4><br>
Nay, fly to altars; there they'll talk you <mark4>dead:</mark4><br>
For fools rush in where angels fear to <mark3>tread.</mark3><br>
Distrustful sense with modest caution <mark4>speaks;</mark4><br>
It still looks home, and short excursions <mark4>makes;</mark4><br>
But rattling nonsense in full volleys <mark3>breaks;</mark3><br>
And never shock'd, and never turn'd <mark4>aside,</mark4><br>
Bursts out, resistless, with a thund'ring <mark3>tide.</mark3><br>
<br>
But where's the man, who counsel can <mark3>bestow,</mark3><br>
Still pleas'd to teach, and yet not proud to <mark1>know?</mark1><br>
Unbias'd, or by favour or by <mark1>spite;</mark1><br>
Not dully prepossess'd, nor blindly <mark3>right;</mark3><br>
Though learn'd, well-bred; and though well-bred, <mark4>sincere;</mark4><br>
Modestly bold, and humanly <mark3>severe?</mark3><br>
Who to a friend his faults can freely <mark1>show,</mark1><br>
And gladly praise the merit of a <mark3>foe?</mark3><br>
Blest with a taste exact, yet <mark5>unconfin'd;</mark5><br>
A knowledge both of books and human <mark4>kind;</mark4><br>
Gen'rous converse; a soul exempt from <mark4>pride;</mark4><br>
And love to praise, with reason on his <mark3>side?</mark3><br>
<br>
Such once were critics; such the happy <mark3>few,</mark3><br>
Athens and Rome in better ages <mark3>knew.</mark3><br>
The mighty Stagirite first left the <mark4>shore,</mark4><br>
Spread all his sails, and durst the deeps <mark3>explore:</mark3><br>
He steer'd securely, and discover'd <mark4>far,</mark4><br>
Led by the light of the Maeonian <mark3>Star.</mark3><br>
Poets, a race long unconfin'd and free,<br>
Still fond and proud of savage liberty,<br>
Receiv'd his laws; and stood convinc'd 'twas <mark4>fit,</mark4><br>
Who conquer'd nature, should preside o'er <mark3>wit.</mark3><br>
<br>
Horace still charms with graceful <mark4>negligence,</mark4><br>
And without methods talks us into <mark1>sense,</mark1><br>
Will, like a friend, familiarly <mark3>convey</mark3><br>
The truest notions in the easiest <mark3>way.</mark3><br>
He, who supreme in <mark4>judgment</mark4>, as in <mark1>wit,</mark1><br>
Might boldly censure, as he boldly <mark3>writ,</mark3><br>
Yet judg'd with coolness, though he sung with <mark4>fire;</mark4><br>
His precepts teach but what his works <mark3>inspire.</mark3><br>
Our critics take a contrary <mark4>extreme,</mark4><br>
They judge with fury, but they write with <mark5>fle'me:</mark5><br>
Nor suffers Horace more in wrong <mark4>translations</mark4><br>
By wits, than critics in as wrong <mark3>quotations.</mark3><br>
<br>
See Dionysius Homer's thoughts <mark4>refine,</mark4><br>
And call new beauties forth from ev'ry <mark3>line!</mark3><br>
Fancy and art in gay Petronius <mark1>please,</mark1><br>
The scholar's learning, with the courtier's <mark3>ease.</mark3><br>
<br>
In grave Quintilian's copious work we <mark4>find</mark4><br>
The justest <mark4>rules</mark4>, and clearest method <mark4>join'd;</mark4><br>
Thus useful arms in magazines we <mark4>place,</mark4><br>
All rang'd in order, and dispos'd with <mark3>grace,</mark3><br>
But less to please the eye, than arm the <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
Still fit for use, and ready at <mark3>command.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thee, bold Longinus! all the Nine <mark1>inspire,</mark1><br>
And bless their critic with a poet's <mark1>fire.</mark1><br>
An ardent judge, who zealous in his <mark1>trust,</mark1><br>
With warmth gives sentence, yet is always <mark3>just;</mark3><br>
Whose own example strengthens all his <mark4>laws;</mark4><br>
And is himself that great sublime he <mark3>draws.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thus long succeeding critics justly <mark4>reign'd,</mark4><br>
Licence <mark4>repress'd</mark4>, and useful laws <mark3>ordain'd;</mark3><br>
Learning and Rome alike in empire <mark3>grew,</mark3><br>
And arts still follow'd where her eagles <mark3>flew;</mark3><br>
From the same foes, at last, both felt their <mark4>doom,</mark4><br>
And the same age saw learning fall, and <mark4>Rome.</mark4><br>
With tyranny, then superstition <mark1>join'd,</mark1><br>
As that the body, this enslav'd the <mark4>mind;</mark4><br>
Much was believ'd, but little <mark4>understood,</mark4><br>
And to be dull was constru'd to be <mark3>good;</mark3><br>
A second deluge learning thus <mark4>o'er-run,</mark4><br>
And the monks finish'd what the Goths <mark3>begun.</mark3><br>
<br>
At length Erasmus, that great, injur'd <mark4>name,</mark4><br>
(The glory of the priesthood, and the <mark3>shame!)</mark3><br>
Stemm'd the wild torrent of a barb'rous <mark3>age,</mark3><br>
And drove those holy Vandals off the <mark3>stage.</mark3><br>
<br>
But see! each <mark4>Muse</mark4>, in Leo's golden <mark4>days,</mark4><br>
Starts from her trance, and trims her wither'd <mark3>bays!</mark3><br>
Rome's ancient genius, o'er its ruins <mark4>spread,</mark4><br>
Shakes off the dust, and rears his rev'rend <mark1>head!</mark1><br>
Then sculpture and her sister-arts <mark3>revive;</mark3><br>
Stones leap'd to form, and rocks began to <mark3>live;</mark3><br>
With sweeter notes each rising temple <mark3>rung;</mark3><br>
A Raphael painted, and a Vida <mark3>sung.</mark3><br>
Immortal Vida! on whose honour'd brow<br>
The poet's bays and critic's ivy <mark3>grow:</mark3><br>
Cremona now shall ever boast thy <mark1>name,</mark1><br>
As next in place to Mantua, next in <mark3>fame!</mark3><br>
<br>
But soon by impious arms from Latium <mark4>chas'd,</mark4><br>
Their ancient bounds the banished Muses <mark4>pass'd;</mark4><br>
Thence arts o'er all the northern world <mark4>advance;</mark4><br>
But critic-learning flourish'd most in <mark3>France.</mark3><br>
The rules a nation born to serve, <mark4>obeys,</mark4><br>
And Boileau still in right of Horace <mark3>sways.</mark3><br>
But we, brave Britons, foreign laws despis'd,<br>
And kept unconquer'd, and <mark5>uncivilis'd,</mark5><br>
Fierce for the liberties of wit, and <mark1>bold,</mark1><br>
We still defied the Romans, as of <mark1>old.</mark1><br>
Yet some there were, among the sounder <mark1>few</mark1><br>
Of those who less presum'd, and better <mark1>knew,</mark1><br>
Who durst assert the juster ancient <mark4>cause,</mark4><br>
And here restor'd wit's fundamental <mark1>laws.</mark1><br>
Such was the Muse, whose rules and practice <mark4>tell</mark4><br>
"Nature's chief master-piece is writing <mark3>well."</mark3><br>
Such was Roscommon?not more learn'd than <mark1>good,</mark1><br>
With manners gen'rous as his noble <mark4>blood;</mark4><br>
To him the wit of Greece and Rome was <mark4>known,</mark4><br>
And ev'ry author's merit, but his <mark3>own.</mark3><br>
Such late was Walsh?the Muse's judge and <mark1>friend,</mark1><br>
Who justly knew to blame or to <mark3>commend;</mark3><br>
To failings mild, but zealous for <mark4>desert;</mark4><br>
The clearest head, and the sincerest <mark4>heart.</mark4><br>
This humble praise, lamented shade! <mark4>receive,</mark4><br>
This praise at least a grateful Muse may <mark4>give:</mark4><br>
The Muse, whose early voice you taught to <mark4>sing,</mark4><br>
Prescrib'd her heights, and prun'd her tender <mark3>wing,</mark3><br>
(Her guide now lost) no more attempts to <mark4>rise,</mark4><br>
But in low numbers short excursions <mark3>tries:</mark3><br>
Content, if hence th' unlearn'd their wants may <mark3>view,</mark3><br>
The learn'd reflect on what before they <mark1>knew:</mark1><br>
Careless of censure, nor too fond of <mark1>fame,</mark1><br>
Still pleas'd to praise, yet not afraid to <mark3>blame,</mark3><br>
Averse alike to flatter, or <mark3>offend,</mark3><br>
Not free from faults, nor yet too vain to <mark1>mend.</mark1><br>
