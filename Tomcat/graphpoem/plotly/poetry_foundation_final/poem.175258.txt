Title : Lines from a Plutocratic Poetaster to a Ditch-digger <br>
Author : Franklin Pierce Adams <br><br>

Sullen, grimy, labouring <mark4>person,</mark4><br>
As I passed you in my <mark3>car,</mark3><br>
I could sense your muffled curse <mark4>on</mark4><br>
It and me and my <mark3>cigar;</mark3><br>
And though mute your malediction, <br>
I could feel it on my <mark3>head,</mark3><br>
As in countless works of <mark4>fiction</mark4><br>
I have <mark3>read.</mark3><br>
<br>
Envy of mine obvious <mark3>leisure</mark3><br>
Seemed to green your glittering <mark3>eye;</mark3><br>
Hate for mine apparent <mark3>pleasure</mark3><br>
Filled you as I motored <mark3>by.</mark3><br>
You who had to dig for three, <mark4>four</mark4><br>
Hours in that unpleasant <mark3>ditch,</mark3><br>
Loathed, despised, and hated me <mark2>for</mark2><br>
Being <mark3>rich.</mark3><br>
<br>
And you cursed me into <mark3>Hades</mark3><br>
As you envied me that <mark4>ride</mark4><br>
With the loveliest of <mark3>ladies</mark3><br>
Sitting at my dexter <mark3>side;</mark3><br>
And your wish, or your <mark3>idea,</mark3><br>
Was to hurl us off some <mark3>cliff.</mark3><br>
I could see that you thought me <mark3>a</mark3><br>
Lucky <mark3>stiff.</mark3><br>
<br>
If you came to the <mark4>decision,</mark4><br>
As my car you mutely <mark3>cussed,</mark3><br>
That allottment and <mark3>division</mark3><br>
Are indecently <mark3>unjust--</mark3><br>
Labouring man, however came <mark1>you</mark1><br>
Thus to think the world <mark3>awry,</mark3><br>
I should be the last to blame you <mark1>...</mark1><br>
So do <mark3>I.</mark3><br>
