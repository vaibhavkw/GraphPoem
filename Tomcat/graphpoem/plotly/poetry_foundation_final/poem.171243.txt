Title : Twenty-year Marriage <br>
Author : Ai <br><br>

You keep me waiting in a <mark4>truck</mark4><br>
with its one good wheel stuck in the ditch,   <br>
while you piss against the south side of a tree. <br>
Hurry. I've got nothing on under my skirt tonight.   <br>
That still excites you, but this pickup has no windows   <br>
and the seat, one fake leather <mark5>thigh,</mark5><br>
pressed close to mine is cold.   <br>
I'm the same size, shape, make as twenty years ago,   <br>
but get inside me, start the <mark4>engine;</mark4><br>
you'll have the strength, the will to move.   <br>
I'll pull, you push, we'll tear each other in half. <br>
Come on, baby, lay me down on my <mark4>back.</mark4><br>
Pretend you don't owe me a <mark5>thing</mark5><br>
and maybe we'll roll out of here,   <br>
leaving the past stacked up behind us; <br>
old newspapers nobody's ever got to read <mark4>again.</mark4><br>
