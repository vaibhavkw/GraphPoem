Title : Poem for My Twentieth Birthday<br>
Author : Kenneth Koch<br><br>

Passing the American graveyard, for my birthday<br>
the crosses stuttering, white on tropical green,<br>
the years' quick focus of faces I do not remember . . <mark4>.</mark4><br>
<br>
The palm trees stalking like deliberate giants<br>
for my birthday, and all the hot adolescent memories<br>
seen through a screen of water . . <mark4>.</mark4><br>
<br>
For my birthday thrust into the adult and actual:<br>
expected to perform the action, not to <mark4>ponder</mark4><br>
the reality beyond the fact,<br>
the man standing upright in the dream.<br>
