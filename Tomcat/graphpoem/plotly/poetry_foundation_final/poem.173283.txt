Title : The Castaway <br>
Author : William Cowper <br><br>

Obscurest night involv'd the <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
Th' Atlantic billows <mark4>roar'd,</mark4><br>
When such a destin'd wretch as <mark3>I,</mark3><br>
Wash'd headlong from on <mark5>board,</mark5><br>
Of friends, of hope, of all <mark3>bereft,</mark3><br>
His floating home for ever <mark3>left.</mark3><br>
<br>
No braver chief could Albion <mark4>boast</mark4><br>
Than he with whom he <mark4>went,</mark4><br>
Nor ever ship left Albion's <mark4>coast,</mark4><br>
With warmer wishes <mark4>sent.</mark4><br>
He lov'd them both, but both in <mark3>vain,</mark3><br>
Nor him beheld, nor her <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
<br>
Not long beneath the whelming <mark4>brine,</mark4><br>
Expert to swim, he <mark3>lay;</mark3><br>
Nor soon he felt his strength <mark3>decline,</mark3><br>
Or courage die <mark3>away;</mark3><br>
But wag'd with death a lasting <mark3>strife,</mark3><br>
Supported by despair of <mark3>life.</mark3><br>
<br>
He shouted: nor his friends had <mark4>fail'd</mark4><br>
To check the vessel's <mark3>course,</mark3><br>
But so the furious blast <mark3>prevail'd,</mark3><br>
That, pitiless <mark3>perforce,</mark3><br>
They left their outcast mate <mark4>behind,</mark4><br>
And scudded still before the <mark3>wind.</mark3><br>
<br>
Some succour yet they could <mark4>afford;</mark4><br>
And, such as storms <mark5>allow,</mark5><br>
The cask, the coop, the floated <mark3>cord,</mark3><br>
         Delay'd not to bestow. <br>
But he (they knew) nor ship, nor <mark3>shore,</mark3><br>
Whate'er they gave, should visit <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
<br>
Nor, cruel as it seem'd, could <mark3>he</mark3><br>
Their haste himself <mark3>condemn,</mark3><br>
Aware that flight, in such a <mark3>sea,</mark3><br>
Alone could rescue <mark3>them;</mark3><br>
Yet bitter felt it still to <mark3>die</mark3><br>
Deserted, and his friends so <mark3>nigh.</mark3><br>
<br>
He long survives, who lives an <mark4>hour</mark4><br>
In ocean, <mark4>self-upheld;</mark4><br>
And so long he, with unspent <mark4>pow'r,</mark4><br>
         His destiny repell'd; <br>
And ever, as the minutes flew, <br>
Entreated help, or cried--Adieu! <br>
<br>
At length, his transient respite <mark4>past,</mark4><br>
His comrades, who <mark4>before</mark4><br>
Had heard his voice in ev'ry <mark3>blast,</mark3><br>
Could catch the sound no <mark1>more.</mark1><br>
For then, by toil subdued, he <mark3>drank</mark3><br>
The stifling wave, and then he <mark3>sank.</mark3><br>
<br>
No poet wept him: but the <mark3>page</mark3><br>
Of narrative <mark4>sincere;</mark4><br>
That tells his name, his worth, his <mark3>age,</mark3><br>
Is wet with Anson's <mark3>tear.</mark3><br>
And tears by bards or heroes <mark4>shed</mark4><br>
Alike immortalize the <mark3>dead.</mark3><br>
<br>
I therefore purpose not, or <mark4>dream,</mark4><br>
Descanting on his <mark4>fate,</mark4><br>
To give the melancholy <mark3>theme</mark3><br>
A more enduring <mark3>date:</mark3><br>
But misery still delights to <mark4>trace</mark4><br>
Its semblance in another's <mark3>case.</mark3><br>
<br>
No voice divine the storm <mark4>allay'd,</mark4><br>
No light propitious <mark4>shone;</mark4><br>
When, snatch'd from all effectual <mark4>aid,</mark4><br>
We perish'd, each <mark3>alone:</mark3><br>
But I beneath a rougher <mark1>sea,</mark1><br>
And whelm'd in deeper gulfs than <mark1>he.</mark1><br>
