Title : Unstable Dream <br>
Author : Sir Thomas Wyatt <br><br>

<br>
Unstable dream, according to the <mark3>place,</mark3><br>
Be steadfast once, or else at least be <mark3>true.</mark3><br>
By tasted sweetness make me not to <mark3>rue</mark3><br>
The sudden loss of thy false feigned <mark3>grace.</mark3><br>
By good respect in such a dangerous <mark3>case</mark3><br>
Thou broughtest not her into this tossing <mark3>mew</mark3><br>
But madest my sprite live, my care to <mark3>renew,</mark3><br>
My body in tempest her succour to <mark3>embrace.</mark3><br>
The body dead, the sprite had his <mark3>desire,</mark3><br>
Painless was th'one, th'other in <mark3>delight.</mark3><br>
Why then, alas, did it not keep it <mark3>right,</mark3><br>
Returning, to leap into the <mark3>fire?</mark3><br>
And where it was at wish, it could not <mark3>remain,</mark3><br>
Such mocks of dreams they turn to deadly <mark3>pain.</mark3><br>
