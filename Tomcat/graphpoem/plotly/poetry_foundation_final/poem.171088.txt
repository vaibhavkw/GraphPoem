Title : Another Feeling <br>
Author : Ruth Stone <br><br>

Once you saw a drove of young <mark4>pigs</mark4><br>
crossing the highway. One of <mark4>them</mark4><br>
pulling his body by the front <mark4>feet,</mark4><br>
the hind legs dragging <mark4>flat.</mark4><br>
Without <mark4>thinking,</mark4><br>
you called the Humane <mark4>Society.</mark4><br>
They came with a net and went for <mark4>him.</mark4><br>
They were matter of fact, <mark4>uniformed;</mark4><br>
there were two of <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
their truck ominous, with a cage.<br>
He was hiding in the weeds. It was <mark5>then</mark5><br>
you saw his eyes. He <mark4>understood.</mark4><br>
He was <mark4>trembling.</mark4><br>
After they took him, you began to suffer <mark4>regret.</mark4><br>
Years later, you remember his misfit <mark4>body</mark4><br>
scrambling to reach the <mark4>others.</mark4><br>
Even at this <mark4>moment</mark4>, your <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
is going too <mark4>fast</mark4>, your hands <mark4>sweat.</mark4><br>
