Title : Cold Blooded Creatures <br>
Author : Elinor Wylie <br><br>

Man, the egregious egoist, <br>
(In mystery the twig is <mark4>bent,)</mark4><br>
Imagines, by some mental <mark4>twist,</mark4><br>
That he alone is sentient <br>
<br>
Of the intolerable <mark3>load</mark3><br>
Which on all living creatures <mark3>lies,</mark3><br>
Nor stoops to pity in the <mark3>toad</mark3><br>
The speechless sorrow of its <mark3>eyes.</mark3><br>
<br>
He asks no questions of the <mark3>snake,</mark3><br>
Nor plumbs the phosphorescent <mark3>gloom</mark3><br>
Where lidless fishes, broad <mark3>awake,</mark3><br>
Swim staring at a night-mare <mark3>doom.</mark3><br>
