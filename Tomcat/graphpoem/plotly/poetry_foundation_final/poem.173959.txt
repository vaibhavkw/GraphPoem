Title : Harlem Shadows <br>
Author : Claude McKay <br><br>

I hear the halting footsteps of a <mark3>lass</mark3><br>
In Negro Harlem when the night lets <mark3>fall</mark3><br>
Its veil. I see the shapes of girls who <mark3>pass</mark3><br>
To bend and barter at desire's <mark3>call.</mark3><br>
Ah, little dark girls who in slippered <mark3>feet</mark3><br>
Go prowling through the night from street to <mark3>street!</mark3><br>
<br>
Through the long night until the silver <mark4>break</mark4><br>
Of day the little gray feet know no <mark4>rest;</mark4><br>
Through the lone night until the last <mark4>snow-flake</mark4><br>
Has dropped from heaven upon the earth's white <mark3>breast,</mark3><br>
The dusky, half-clad girls of tired <mark1>feet</mark1><br>
Are trudging, thinly shod, from street to <mark1>street.</mark1><br>
<br>
Ah, stern harsh world, that in the wretched <mark3>way</mark3><br>
Of poverty, dishonor and <mark4>disgrace,</mark4><br>
Has pushed the timid little feet of <mark3>clay,</mark3><br>
The sacred brown feet of my fallen <mark3>race!</mark3><br>
Ah, heart of me, the weary, weary <mark1>feet</mark1><br>
In Harlem wandering from street to <mark1>street.</mark1><br>
