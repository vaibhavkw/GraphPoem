Title : Sonnet to William Wilberforce, Esq. <br>
Author : William Cowper <br><br>

Thy country, Wilberforce, with just <mark3>disdain,</mark3><br>
Hears thee, by cruel men and impious, <mark4>call'd</mark4><br>
Fanatic, for thy zeal to loose th' enthrall'd<br>
From exile, public sale, and slav'ry's <mark3>chain.</mark3><br>
Friend of the poor, the wrong'd, the fetter-gall'd,<br>
Fear not lest labour such as thine be <mark3>vain!</mark3><br>
Thou hast achiev'd a part; hast gain'd the <mark3>ear</mark3><br>
Of Britain's senate to thy glorious <mark4>cause;</mark4><br>
Hope smiles, joy <mark4>springs</mark4>, and tho' cold caution <mark3>pause</mark3><br>
And weave delay, the better hour is <mark3>near,</mark3><br>
That shall remunerate thy toils <mark3>severe</mark3><br>
By peace for Afric, fenc'd with British <mark3>laws.</mark3><br>
Enjoy what thou hast won, esteem and <mark3>love</mark3><br>
From all the just on earth, and all the blest <mark3>above!</mark3><br>
