Title : The Story of Phoebus and Daphne, Applied <br>
Author : Edmund Waller <br><br>

Thyrsis, a youth of the inspired <mark3>train,</mark3><br>
Fair Sacharissa lov'd, but lov'd in <mark3>vain;</mark3><br>
Like Phoebus sung the no less amorous <mark3>boy;</mark3><br>
Like Daphne she, as lovely, and as <mark3>coy;</mark3><br>
With numbers he the flying nymph <mark3>pursues,</mark3><br>
With numbers such as Phoebus' self might <mark3>use;</mark3><br>
Such is the chase when Love and Fancy <mark4>leads,</mark4><br>
O'er craggy <mark4>mountains</mark4>, and through flow'ry <mark3>meads;</mark3><br>
Invok'd to testify the lover's <mark3>care,</mark3><br>
Or form some image of his cruel <mark3>fair:</mark3><br>
Urg'd with his fury, like a wounded <mark4>deer,</mark4><br>
O'er these he fled; and now approaching <mark3>near,</mark3><br>
Had reach'd the nymph with his harmonious <mark3>lay,</mark3><br>
Whom all his charms could not incline to <mark3>stay.</mark3><br>
Yet what he sung in his immortal <mark3>strain,</mark3><br>
Though unsuccessful, was not sung in <mark1>vain;</mark1><br>
All but the nymph that should redress his <mark3>wrong,</mark3><br>
Attend his passion, and approve his <mark3>song.</mark3><br>
Like Phoebus thus, acquiring unsought <mark4>praise,</mark4><br>
He catch'd at love, and fill'd his arm with <mark3>bays.</mark3><br>
