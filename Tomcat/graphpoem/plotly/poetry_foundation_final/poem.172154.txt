Title : The Golden Schlemiel <br>
Author : Irving Feldman <br><br>

So there's a cabbie in Cairo named <mark1>Deif.</mark1><br>
So he found 5,000 bucks in the back <mark4>seat.</mark4><br>
So meanwhile his daughter was very <mark4>sick.</mark4><br>
So he needed the money for medicine <mark4>bad.</mark4><br>
So never <mark4>mind.</mark4><br>
So he looked for the fare and gave it <mark4>back.</mark4><br>
So then the kid <mark4>died.</mark4><br>
So they fired him for doing good deeds on company <mark4>time.</mark4><br>
So the President heard it on the <mark3>radio.</mark3><br>
So he gave him a locally built <mark4>Fiat.</mark4><br>
So I read it in the <mark4>papers.</mark4><br>
So you read it <mark4>here.</mark4><br>
<br>
A poor man has less than weight, has negative gravity, his life a slow explosion. Barely he makes the days meet. Like doors they burst open. Money, job, daughter fly away from him. Irony, injustice, bits of horror come close, <mark4>cohere.</mark4><br>
<br>
They are with us, the poor, like the inner life which is wantless too; our souls' white globes float somehow in the blue, levitating and bobbing gently at middle height over the bubbling fleshpots.<br>
<br>
Our effort to remake the found world as the lost reverie is <mark4>desire.</mark4><br>
So, little Yasmin was sick, sick to the point of <mark3>dying.</mark3><br>
She was like a garden coughing and <mark3>drying.</mark3><br>
And suddenly her salvation was there, a sheepskin, <mark4>yes,</mark4><br>
a satchel of money meekly baaing from the <mark3>rear.</mark3><br>
A miracle in the <mark4>offing?</mark4><br>
That famous retired philanthropist named <mark4>God</mark4><br>
was back in business? was starting to take a <mark4>hand?</mark4><br>
directing things maybe from the back <mark1>seat?</mark1><br>
<br>
Restored to its rich owner (he tipped a fig and a fart, a raspberry of plump nil), lying safely on his lap, the money was mute again, was superfluity, and root and sum and symbol, both lettuce and lump, of all <mark4>evil.</mark4><br>
She too approaching that <mark4>state,</mark4><br>
Yasmin, a flower, meantime, <mark1>dying.</mark1><br>
For the locally assembled daughter a locally assembled <mark1>Fiat.</mark1><br>
<br>
Too wantless to imagine the money <mark4>his?</mark4><br>
<br>
Spurned the miracle and thwarted the <mark4>grace?</mark4><br>
So loved the law he gave it his only begotten <mark4>daughter?</mark4><br>
Effed and offed his own <mark4>kid?</mark4><br>
Saint and monster, poor man and <mark4>fool,</mark4><br>
slowly exploding, Deif all <mark4>this.</mark4><br>
Yes, one melts at his meekness,<br>
scoffs at the folly, trembles<br>
for his stupor of bliss of <mark4>obedience,</mark4><br>
gasps at his pride, <mark4>weeps</mark4><br>
for his wantlessness,<br>
grunts when irony that twists the mouth jabs the <mark4>gut.</mark4><br>
Then horror?the dark miracle?roaring, <mark3>leaps</mark3><br>
into the front <mark3>seat</mark3>, grabs the wheel and runs you down in the <mark4>street</mark4><br>
?while you sit on a cafe terrace innocently reading the <mark4>paper</mark4><br>
or, bent above a radio, feel the news waves break against your <mark4>teeth.</mark4><br>
Deif in grief. Deif in mourning. Deif <mark4>bereaved.</mark4><br>
<br>
Deif in the driver's seat. Deif without a <mark5>beef.</mark5><br>
And daily in four editions and every hour <mark4>on</mark4><br>
<br>
the hour, the media heap your dish with <mark4>images</mark4><br>
of sorrows and suffering, cruelty, maiming, <mark4>death.</mark4><br>
(Our real griefs in their imaginary jargons.) <br>
And you cannot touch a single sufferer, <mark4>comfort</mark4><br>
one victim, or stay any murderous <mark1>hand.</mark1><br>
Consumer of woes, the news confirms <mark3>you</mark3><br>
in guilt, your guilt becomes <mark5>complicity,</mark5><br>
your complicity <mark1>paralysis</mark1>, <mark4>paralysis</mark4><br>
your guilt; elsewhere <mark4>always</mark4>, your life <mark4>becomes</mark4><br>
an alibi, your best innocence a shrug, <br>
your shrug an unacknowledged <mark1>rage</mark1>, your <mark1>rage</mark1><br>
is for reality, nothing <mark3>less</mark3>, <mark1>Yes,</mark1><br>
you feel, murder would be better than hanging <mark4>around;</mark4><br>
if only your fist could penetrate the <mark4>print,</mark4><br>
you too might enter the reality of news <mark4>....</mark4><br>
You switch the radio on, hungrily turn the <mark3>page</mark3><br>
of sorrows and suffering, cruelty, maiming, <mark1>death.</mark1><br>
Pasha, President, playboy swing <mark4>masterfully</mark4><br>
<br>
above our heads?what style! what heroes!?fling <mark4>themselves</mark4><br>
over the headlines into the empyrean<br>
beyond our lowly weather?ah, there all the <mark1>news</mark1><br>
is blue and blank, those soarings, those mock <mark4>descents</mark4><br>
are them writing their own tickets in <mark4>heaven.</mark4><br>
Fortune, true, is spiteful and fickle, and <mark4>glamour</mark4><br>
itself must stalk them?but cannot shoot so <mark3>high</mark3><br>
as impotence <mark4>dreams</mark4>, as resentment <mark4>wishes.</mark4><br>
Gorgeous, limber, and free, like our <mark4>consciences,</mark4><br>
a law unto themselves, a darker law to <mark4>us</mark4><br>
?in their suntans our <mark3>shadow.</mark3><br>
And where they fly, the lines of force <mark4>accompany,</mark4><br>
<br>
the patterns of deference continue to <mark1>comfort,</mark1><br>
a maggotism distracting <mark4>irony.</mark4><br>
Their rods flatten others, their staffs flatter <mark4>them</mark4><br>
?you and I pay for the lies we <mark4>get,</mark4><br>
but heroes get the lies they pay <mark4>for.</mark4><br>
So here's the President's ear on the radio's <mark4>belly</mark4><br>
?if there are rumbles in <mark4>Egypt</mark4>, he'll know <mark3>it,</mark3><br>
he'll proclaim, Fix this! (Fixed!), Do this! (Done!). <br>
And here is Deif's story beating at his eardrum. <br>
Tremble, mock, shrug, or writhe, you and <mark3>I</mark3><br>
cannot write the ending, cannot snatch <mark4>glory</mark4><br>
of authorship from the anonymity of <mark4>events.</mark4><br>
The President can. The President <mark4>does.</mark4><br>
His literature is lives, is Deif <mark4>smiling:</mark4><br>
golden, seraphic and sappy, sheepish, <mark4>sweet;</mark4><br>
is Deif not understanding a thing and <mark4>grateful</mark4><br>
and happy like a puppy given to a <mark4>child.</mark4><br>
He speaks: his fiat is a <mark1>Fiat,</mark1><br>
assembled locally and worth five <mark4>grand</mark4><br>
(out of the President's pocket? Pal, guess <mark4>again!)</mark4><br>
?which cancels Deif's deed down to the <mark4>penny.</mark4><br>
Deif has no claim on the moral law, no <mark4>dignity,</mark4><br>
no destiny, no daughter; his <mark4>suffering</mark4><br>
won't embarrass, his monstrousness <mark4>appall;</mark4><br>
injustice is removed, and nothing left in its <mark4>place,</mark4><br>
the spot swept clear, blood expunged, crowd <mark4>dispersed,</mark4><br>
and Deif himself sent to park around the <mark4>corner,</mark4><br>
a bystander to his life, a pure <mark1>schlemiel.</mark1><br>
Deif never did anything, nothing ever <mark4>happened</mark4><br>
?all for the greater glory of the <mark1>State.</mark1><br>
Exit Deif with his dead daugher in his <mark4>arms.</mark4><br>
<br>
Re-enter Deif in a Fiat meekly <mark4>beeping,</mark4><br>
and overhead, Yasmin, the locally <mark4>dis-</mark4><br>
assembled, the winged, pointing down and proudly <mark4>beaming.</mark4><br>
Upon such sacrifices the gods themselves shy clods.<br>
<br>
Riffling the pages of sorrow and <mark1>suffering,</mark1><br>
the President carefully lowers his hydrocephalic head onto the news he <mark4>made.</mark4><br>
Besides, the State abhors the inner life, finds its rich wantlessness, its invisible reverie uninteresting because unmanageable, damned because unusable. Incapable of inactivity, the State cannot submit to stillness and seeks precisely to create the desire it will manage. It requires neither pensive persons nor upright citizens but a smiling multitude. The State is a Midas. Every absence and invisibility it would make bright material, for what is invisible?Deif's resolve to return the money or patient grief recollecting the spilt petals of his lost jasmine?what is invisible the State believes deplorable, knows to be dangerous. Such is the anxiety that caused the President to lift a finger, to touch <mark1>Deif.</mark1><br>
<br>
To reconstitute the found Fiat as the lost <mark1>daughter.</mark1><br>
<br>
Wheeled, powerful, in progress; altar and <mark4>throne</mark4><br>
<br>
and golden veal, leviathan and <mark4>juggernaut;</mark4><br>
and nearby, one Reda Deif?once <mark4>slowly</mark4><br>
<mark4>exploding</mark4>, once a spirit <mark4>darkening</mark4><br>
all earthly glory?observes the <mark1>State</mark1><br>
adoring itself as its <mark4>image.</mark4><br>
Deif attending the <mark4>vehicle.</mark4><br>
<br>
His air de chauffeur, a <mark4>man</mark4><br>
who defers to a car, <mark4>infers</mark4><br>
his value from his <mark4>deference.</mark4><br>
He bows, approaching the <mark3>door,</mark3><br>
bows to the aura and <mark1>glory</mark1><br>
around, behind, beyond, <mark4>within</mark4><br>
this scrap of State, this scrim<br>
of status before the reeling <mark4>stars;</mark4><br>
he bows to be bowing. <mark4>Air</mark4><br>
now of one waiting <mark1>for</mark1><br>
its owner to appear. Deif <mark4>knows</mark4><br>
it can't be Deif, must be <mark4>another:</mark4><br>
grand, glowing, ponderous, a <mark4>meteor,</mark4><br>
breathtaker and heartstealer, mover and <mark4>shaker,</mark4><br>
who merely presuming <mark4>possesses,</mark4><br>
imposes, distresses between his <mark4>flashing</mark4><br>
attraction, his haughty don't-touch! <br>
Let poorman-Deif dare show his <mark4>face,</mark4><br>
guarddog-Deif will show him the <mark1>door!</mark1><br>
He shifts from foot to <mark4>foot</mark4><br>
beside himself beside the <mark4>car.</mark4><br>
Embarrassment? <mark4>Well,</mark4><br>
Seepage of eternity we call the sea, the <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
<br>
Such spacious summer nights come also to <mark1>Deif,</mark1><br>
the sky enormous, intimate, Deif too brief, too dusky. <br>
The universe invites him to fly?if only he could <mark3>fly!</mark3><br>
It snatches his heart and throws it into the <mark3>blue,</mark3><br>
the cosmic wafting blows it away.<br>
Must I? Must I <mark4>follow?</mark4><br>
he asks the whirlwind's <mark4>roar.</mark4><br>
His heart will shatter to encompass <mark4>all</mark4><br>
or, lightless coal, plummet through the dark and <mark4>azure!</mark4><br>
Lies down again, throbbing, where he was. <mark1>Schlemiel</mark1><br>
and saint and monster are cradled and tucked <mark3>in.</mark3><br>
However theatrically laid on thick by fate, how did this tiny whisper of injustice exceed the general and deafening static of woe?<br>
Do you think Deif's boss called a press conference to announce the <mark4>shafting?</mark4><br>
<br>
Or that his neighbors issued a news <mark4>release?</mark4><br>
Do you think Deif himself told the <mark3>story?</mark3><br>
Really? him? that schlemiel? And to whom in that Calcutta on the <mark4>Nile?</mark4><br>
Maybe you think it doesn't flatter the President a little too <mark4>neatly?</mark4><br>
Think it isn't the least bit <mark4>imaginary?</mark4><br>
No poets of Presidency in <mark4>Egypt?</mark4><br>
No P.R. men in <mark4>Cairo?</mark4><br>
Do you think there really is a man named <mark1>Deif?</mark1><br>
I think I prefer to think that Deif <mark4>exists,</mark4><br>
yes, and even little Yasmin dead dead <mark4>dead</mark4><br>
<br>
indeed, dead for a <mark4>fact.</mark4><br>
I think I prefer this <mark4>horror</mark4><br>
which tells me it is possible to <mark4>feel</mark4><br>
if not to <mark5>believe.</mark5><br>
Only horror survives our raging <mark1>irony</mark1><br>
and we survive by <mark1>horror.</mark1><br>
So one delves a death and turns ... a pretty <mark1>penny,</mark1><br>
some moral quid for all that mortal quo (O <mark4>wit</mark4><br>
<br>
for woe!)?O "think" and "feel," <mark4>increments</mark4><br>
of spirit that transfuse, that elevate! <mark4>Tumescent</mark4><br>
atop her grave, and how a great heart <mark4>gushes</mark4>, <mark4>floods</mark4><br>
the frame with gladdening news: One has come <mark3>through!</mark3><br>
?which makes one, after all, complicit, one's <mark4>spade</mark4><br>
a spade, Yasmin, Deif one's victims, one's <mark4>life</mark4><br>
vicarious, vacant, oneself a <mark4>fiction</mark4><br>
held up to a fate, shattered by a <mark4>fury.</mark4><br>
Pluck out your radio, rend your <mark1>paper!</mark1><br>
Savage death demands a savage <mark4>discipline.</mark4><br>
Down your head, roll in the dirt, <mark4>mourn!</mark4><br>
As to bad before, so now to better <mark4>fortune:</mark4><br>
Deif submits. Incorrigible <mark1>schlemiel,</mark1><br>
<br>
he doesn't grab it with both <mark4>hands,</mark4><br>
one on each tit. See <mark4>him!</mark4><br>
insulated from the earth by <mark4>rubber,</mark4><br>
two fingers gingerly on the <mark3>wheel,</mark3><br>
his other arm out to catch the <mark4>breeze</mark4><br>
as he drives into the sunset of the <mark3>real,</mark3><br>
his position false but increasingly <mark4>familiar.</mark4><br>
Fortune sits on him like a ton of <mark4>shit</mark4><br>
?a raven of another choler?and <mark4>smiles.</mark4><br>
Sociably, he returns the <mark4>smile.</mark4><br>
Farewell, Deif! Farewell, <mark4>brother!</mark4><br>
