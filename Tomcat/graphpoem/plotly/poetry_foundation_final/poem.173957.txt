Title : America <br>
Author : Claude McKay <br><br>

Although she feeds me bread of <mark4>bitterness,</mark4><br>
And sinks into my throat her tiger's <mark3>tooth,</mark3><br>
Stealing my breath of life, I will <mark4>confess</mark4><br>
I love this cultured hell that tests my <mark3>youth.</mark3><br>
Her vigor flows like tides into my <mark3>blood,</mark3><br>
Giving me strength erect against her <mark3>hate,</mark3><br>
Her bigness sweeps my being like a <mark3>flood.</mark3><br>
<mark4>Yet</mark4>, as a rebel fronts a king in <mark3>state,</mark3><br>
I stand within her walls with not a <mark4>shred</mark4><br>
Of terror, malice, not a word of <mark4>jeer.</mark4><br>
Darkly I gaze into the days <mark3>ahead,</mark3><br>
And see her might and granite wonders <mark4>there,</mark4><br>
Beneath the touch of Time's unerring <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
Like priceless treasures sinking in the <mark3>sand.</mark3><br>
