Title : The War-song of Dinas Vawr <br>
Author : Thomas Love Peacock <br><br>

<br>
The mountain sheep are <mark4>sweeter,</mark4><br>
But the valley sheep are <mark4>fatter;</mark4><br>
We therefore deemed it meeter<br>
To carry off the <mark3>latter.</mark3><br>
We made an <mark3>expedition;</mark3><br>
We met a <mark4>host</mark4>, and quelled <mark4>it;</mark4><br>
We forced a strong <mark3>position,</mark3><br>
And killed the men who held <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
<br>
On Dyfed's richest <mark3>valley,</mark3><br>
Where herds of kine were <mark3>browsing,</mark3><br>
We made a mighty <mark3>sally,</mark3><br>
To furnish our <mark3>carousing.</mark3><br>
Fierce warriors rushed to meet <mark1>us;</mark1><br>
We met <mark1>them</mark1>, and o'erthrew <mark1>them:</mark1><br>
They struggled hard to beat <mark1>us;</mark1><br>
But we conquered <mark1>them</mark1>, and slew <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
<br>
As we drove our prize at <mark4>leisure,</mark4><br>
The king marched forth to catch <mark1>us:</mark1><br>
His rage surpassed all <mark3>measure,</mark3><br>
But his people could not match <mark1>us.</mark1><br>
He fled to his <mark4>hall-pillars;</mark4><br>
And, ere our force we led <mark1>off,</mark1><br>
Some sacked his house and <mark4>cellars,</mark4><br>
While others cut his head <mark1>off.</mark1><br>
<br>
We there, in strife bewild'ring,<br>
Spilt blood enough to swim <mark4>in:</mark4><br>
We orphaned many <mark4>children,</mark4><br>
And widowed many <mark4>women.</mark4><br>
The eagles and the <mark4>ravens</mark4><br>
We glutted with our foemen;<br>
The heroes and the <mark3>cravens,</mark3><br>
The spearmen and the <mark4>bowmen.</mark4><br>
<br>
We brought away from <mark3>battle,</mark3><br>
And much their land bemoaned <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
Two thousand head of <mark3>cattle,</mark3><br>
And the head of him who owned <mark1>them:</mark1><br>
Ednyfed, king of Dyfed,<br>
His head was borne before <mark1>us;</mark1><br>
His wine and beasts supplied our <mark4>feasts,</mark4><br>
And his overthrow, our <mark4>chorus.</mark4><br>
