Title : Bailing Out-A Poem for the 1970s <br>
Author : Eleanor Wilner <br><br>

Whose woods these are I think I know ...<br>
The landings had gone wrong; white <mark4>silk,</mark4><br>
like <mark4>shrouds</mark4>, covered the <mark4>woods.</mark4><br>
The trees had trapped the flimsy <mark4>fabric</mark4><br>
in their web--everywhere the harnessed <mark4>bodies</mark4><br>
hung--helpless, treading air <br>
like <mark4>water.</mark4><br>
We thought to float <mark1>down</mark1><br>
easily--a simple <mark5>thing</mark5><br>
like coming home: feet first, <br>
a welcome from the waiting <mark4>fields,</mark4><br>
a gentle fall in <mark4>clover.</mark4><br>
<br>
We hadn't counted on <mark5>this</mark5><br>
wilderness, the gusts of <mark4>wind</mark4><br>
that took us over; we were <mark4>surprised</mark4><br>
by the tenacity of branching <mark4>wood,</mark4><br>
its reach, and how impenetrable <br>
the place we left, and thought we knew,   <br>
could <mark4>be.</mark4><br>
Sometimes now, as we sway, <mark4>unwilling</mark4><br>
pendulums that mark the <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
we still can <mark4>dream</mark4><br>
someone will come and cut us <mark1>down.</mark1><br>
There is nothing here but <mark4>words</mark4>, the <mark4>calls</mark4><br>
we try the dark with--hoping for a <mark4>human</mark4><br>
ear, response, a rescue <mark4>party.</mark4><br>
But all we hear is <mark4>other</mark4><br>
voices like our own, other <mark1>bodies</mark1><br>
tangled in the <mark4>lines,</mark4><br>
the repetition of a cry from every <mark3>tree:</mark3><br>
<br>
I can't help you, help <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
