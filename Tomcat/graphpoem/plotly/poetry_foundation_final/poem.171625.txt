Title : Men at My Father's Funeral <br>
Author : William Matthews <br><br>

The ones his age who shook my <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
on their way out sent fear along   <br>
my arm like heroin. These <mark4>weren't</mark4><br>
men mute about their <mark4>feelings,</mark4><br>
or what's a body language for? <br>
<br>
And I, the glib one, who'd <mark4>stood</mark4><br>
with my back to my father's <mark5>body</mark5><br>
and praised the heart that attacked him?   <br>
I'd made my stab at elegy, <br>
the flesh made word: the very <mark4>spit</mark4><br>
<br>
in my mouth was sour with ruth <br>
and <mark4>eloquence</mark4>, What could be <mark4>worse?</mark4><br>
Silence, the anthem of my <mark4>father's</mark4><br>
new country. And thus this babble,   <br>
like a dial tone, from our <mark4>bodies.</mark4><br>
