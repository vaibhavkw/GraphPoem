Title : Wingfoot Lake <br>
Author : Rita Dove <br><br>

(Independence Day, 1964)<br>
On her 36th birthday, Thomas had shown her   <br>
her first swimming pool. It had <mark4>been</mark4><br>
his favorite color, exactly--just <br>
so much of it, the swimmers' white arms <mark4>jutting</mark4><br>
into the chevrons of high <mark4>society.</mark4><br>
She had rolled up her <mark5>window</mark5><br>
and told him to drive on, <mark4>fast.</mark4><br>
<br>
Now this act of mercy: four <mark4>daughters</mark4><br>
dragging her to their husbands' company <mark4>picnic,</mark4><br>
white families on one side and <mark4>them</mark4><br>
on the other, unpacking the <mark4>same</mark4><br>
squeeze bottles of Heinz, the <mark1>same</mark1><br>
waxy beef patties and Salem potato chip <mark4>bags.</mark4><br>
So he was dead for the first <mark4>time</mark4><br>
on Fourth of July--ten years ago <br>
<br>
had been harder, waiting for something to <mark4>happen,</mark4><br>
and ten years before that, the <mark4>girls</mark4><br>
like young horses eyeing the <mark4>track.</mark4><br>
Last August she stood alone for <mark4>hours</mark4><br>
in front of the T.V. <mark4>set</mark4><br>
as a crow's wing moved slowly through <br>
the white streets of <mark4>government.</mark4><br>
That brave <mark4>swimming</mark4><br>
<br>
scared her, like Joanna <mark4>saying</mark4><br>
Mother, we're Afro-Americans now! <br>
What did she know about Africa?   <br>
Were there lakes like this <mark4>one</mark4><br>
with a rowboat pushed under the <mark4>pier?</mark4><br>
Or Thomas' Great <mark4>Mississippi</mark4><br>
with its sullen silks? (There <mark4>was</mark4><br>
the Nile but the Nile belonged <br>
<br>
to God.) Where she came <mark4>from</mark4><br>
was the past, 12 miles into <mark4>town</mark4><br>
where nobody had locked their back <mark4>door,</mark4><br>
and Goodyear hadn't begun to dream of a <mark4>park</mark4><br>
under the company symbol, a white <mark4>foot</mark4><br>
sprouting two small <mark4>wings.</mark4><br>
