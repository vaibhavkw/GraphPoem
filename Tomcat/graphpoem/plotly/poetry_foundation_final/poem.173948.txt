Title : The Garden <br>
Author : Andrew Marvell <br><br>

How vainly men themselves <mark3>amaze</mark3><br>
To win the palm, the oak, or <mark3>bays,</mark3><br>
And their uncessant labours <mark3>see</mark3><br>
Crown'd from some single herb or <mark3>tree,</mark3><br>
Whose short and narrow verged <mark4>shade</mark4><br>
Does prudently their toils <mark4>upbraid;</mark4><br>
While all flow'rs and all trees do <mark4>close</mark4><br>
To weave the garlands of <mark3>repose.</mark3><br>
<br>
Fair Quiet, have I found thee <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
And Innocence, thy sister <mark4>dear!</mark4><br>
Mistaken long, I sought you <mark3>then</mark3><br>
In busy companies of <mark3>men;</mark3><br>
Your sacred plants, if here <mark3>below,</mark3><br>
Only among the plants will <mark3>grow.</mark3><br>
Society is all but <mark4>rude,</mark4><br>
To this delicious <mark4>solitude.</mark4><br>
<br>
No white nor red was ever <mark4>seen</mark4><br>
So am'rous as this lovely <mark3>green.</mark3><br>
Fond lovers, cruel as their <mark3>flame,</mark3><br>
Cut in these trees their mistress' <mark3>name;</mark3><br>
Little, alas, they know or <mark4>heed</mark4><br>
How far these beauties hers <mark3>exceed!</mark3><br>
Fair trees! wheres'e'er your barks I <mark4>wound,</mark4><br>
No name shall but your own be <mark3>found.</mark3><br>
<br>
When we have run our passion's <mark3>heat,</mark3><br>
Love hither makes his best <mark3>retreat.</mark3><br>
The gods, that mortal beauty <mark4>chase,</mark4><br>
Still in a tree did end their <mark3>race:</mark3><br>
Apollo hunted Daphne <mark3>so,</mark3><br>
Only that she might laurel <mark1>grow;</mark1><br>
And Pan did after Syrinx <mark4>speed,</mark4><br>
Not as a nymph, but for a <mark3>reed.</mark3><br>
<br>
What wond'rous life in this I <mark3>lead!</mark3><br>
Ripe apples drop about my <mark3>head;</mark3><br>
The luscious clusters of the <mark4>vine</mark4><br>
Upon my mouth do crush their <mark3>wine;</mark3><br>
The nectarine and curious <mark3>peach</mark3><br>
Into my hands themselves do <mark3>reach;</mark3><br>
Stumbling on melons as I <mark4>pass,</mark4><br>
Ensnar'd with flow'rs, I fall on <mark3>grass.</mark3><br>
<br>
Meanwhile the mind, from pleasure <mark4>less,</mark4><br>
Withdraws into its <mark4>happiness;</mark4><br>
The <mark3>mind</mark3>, that ocean where each <mark4>kind</mark4><br>
Does straight its own resemblance <mark3>find,</mark3><br>
Yet it creates, transcending <mark4>these,</mark4><br>
Far other <mark4>worlds</mark4>, and other <mark3>seas;</mark3><br>
Annihilating all that's <mark4>made</mark4><br>
To a green thought in a green <mark1>shade.</mark1><br>
<br>
Here at the fountain's sliding <mark4>foot,</mark4><br>
Or at some fruit tree's mossy <mark4>root,</mark4><br>
Casting the body's vest <mark4>aside,</mark4><br>
My soul into the boughs does <mark3>glide;</mark3><br>
There like a bird it sits and <mark4>sings,</mark4><br>
Then whets, and combs its silver <mark3>wings;</mark3><br>
And, till prepar'd for longer <mark4>flight,</mark4><br>
Waves in its plumes the various <mark3>light.</mark3><br>
<br>
Such was that happy <mark4>garden-state,</mark4><br>
While man there walk'd without a <mark3>mate;</mark3><br>
After a place so pure and <mark4>sweet,</mark4><br>
What other help could yet be <mark3>meet!</mark3><br>
But 'twas beyond a mortal's <mark4>share</mark4><br>
To wander solitary <mark3>there:</mark3><br>
Two paradises 'twere in <mark4>one</mark4><br>
To live in paradise <mark4>alone.</mark4><br>
<br>
How well the skillful gard'ner <mark3>drew</mark3><br>
Of flow'rs and herbs this dial <mark3>new,</mark3><br>
Where from above the milder <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
Does through a fragrant zodiac <mark3>run;</mark3><br>
And as it works, th' industrious <mark3>bee</mark3><br>
Computes its time as well as <mark3>we.</mark3><br>
How could such sweet and wholesome <mark4>hours</mark4><br>
Be reckon'd but with herbs and <mark4>flow'rs!</mark4><br>
