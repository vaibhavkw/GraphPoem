Title : from The Laurel Tree <br>
Author : Louis Simpson <br><br>

In the clear light that confuses <mark4>everything</mark4><br>
Only you, dark <mark4>laurel,</mark4><br>
Shadow my <mark4>house,</mark4><br>
<br>
Lifting your arms in the <mark4>anguish</mark4><br>
Of nature at the stake. <br>
And at night, quivering with <mark4>tears,</mark4><br>
<br>
You are like the tree called <mark4>Tasso's.</mark4><br>
Crippled, and hooped with <mark4>iron,</mark4><br>
It stands on Peter's <mark4>hill.</mark4><br>
<br>
When the lovers prop their <mark4>bicycles</mark4><br>
And sit on the high <mark4>benches</mark4><br>
That look across to eternity, <br>
<br>
That tree makes their own <mark4>torsion</mark4><br>
Seem natural. And so, they're <mark4>comforted.</mark4><br>
<br>
One of the local philosophers <mark4>...</mark4><br>
<br>
He says, "In <mark1>California</mark1><br>
We have the old anarchist <mark4>tradition."</mark4><br>
What can he mean? Is there an anarchist <mark1>tradition?</mark1><br>
<br>
And why would an anarchist want <mark4>one?</mark4><br>
O <mark1>California,</mark1><br>
Is there a tree without <mark4>opinions?</mark4><br>
<br>
Come, let me clasp <mark3>you!</mark3><br>
Let me feel the idea <mark4>breathing.</mark4><br>
I too cry O for a life of <mark4>sensations</mark4><br>
<br>
Rather than <mark4>thoughts--</mark4><br>
"The sayling Pine, the Cedar proud and <mark4>tall."</mark4><br>
Like the girls in our <mark4>neighborhood,</mark4><br>
<br>
They're beautiful and <mark4>silent.</mark4><br>
As I was digging in the back <mark4>yard</mark4><br>
<br>
I thought of a man in <mark4>China.</mark4><br>
<br>
A lifetime, it seemed, we gazed at each <mark1>other.</mark1><br>
I could see and hear his <mark4>heartbeats</mark4><br>
Like a spade hurling clods. <br>
<br>
He pointed behind him, and I saw <br>
That the hills were covered with armed <mark4>men,</mark4><br>
And they were all on the other <mark4>side</mark4><br>
<br>
Of the life that I held <mark4>dear.</mark4><br>
He said, "We are as <mark4>various</mark4><br>
As the twigs of a <mark5>tree,</mark5><br>
<br>
But now the tree moves as one <mark4>man.</mark4><br>
It walks. And the earth <mark5>trembles</mark5><br>
When a race of slaves is <mark4>leaving."</mark4><br>
<br>
I said, "Yet, all these <mark4>people</mark4><br>
Will fall down as one <mark1>man</mark1><br>
<br>
When the entrails of a bomb are <mark1>breathing.</mark1><br>
<br>
When we came down from Chosin   <br>
Carrying the guns in dainty <mark4>snow-wear</mark4><br>
And all the dead we had <mark4>to,</mark4><br>
<br>
It was a time of forgetfulness,   <br>
Like a plucked <mark4>string.</mark4><br>
It was a river of <mark4>darkness.</mark4><br>
<br>
Was it not so on your side, when you came   <br>
To the sea that was covered with <mark4>ships?</mark4><br>
Let us speak to each <mark1>other,</mark1><br>
<br>
Let the word rise, making dark strokes in the <mark3>air.</mark3><br>
That bird flies over the heads of the armed <mark1>men."</mark1><br>
One part of the tree grows <mark4>outward.</mark4><br>
<br>
The other I saw when, with a <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
I explored the cellar--shattering <mark4>roots.</mark4><br>
<br>
They had broken through the <mark4>wall,</mark4><br>
<br>
As though there were something in my <mark4>rubbish</mark4><br>
That life would have at <mark4>last.</mark4><br>
I must be patient with <mark4>shapes</mark4><br>
<br>
Of automobile fenders and ketchup <mark4>bottles.</mark4><br>
These things are the <mark4>beginning</mark4><br>
Of things not visible to the naked eye.   <br>
<br>
It was so in the time of Tobit-- <br>
The dish glowed when the angel held <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
It is so that spiritual <mark4>messengers</mark4><br>
<br>
Deliver their <mark4>meaning.</mark4><br>
