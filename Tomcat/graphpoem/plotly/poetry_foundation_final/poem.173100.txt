Title : She Walks in Beauty <br>
Author : Lord Byron (George Gordon) <br><br>

She walks in beauty, like the <mark3>night</mark3><br>
Of cloudless climes and starry <mark3>skies;</mark3><br>
And all that's best of dark and <mark3>bright</mark3><br>
Meet in her aspect and her <mark3>eyes;</mark3><br>
Thus mellowed to that tender <mark3>light</mark3><br>
Which heaven to gaudy day <mark3>denies.</mark3><br>
<br>
One shade the more, one ray the <mark4>less,</mark4><br>
Had half impaired the nameless <mark4>grace</mark4><br>
Which waves in every raven <mark4>tress,</mark4><br>
Or softly lightens o'er her <mark4>face;</mark4><br>
Where thoughts serenely sweet <mark4>express,</mark4><br>
How pure, how dear their <mark4>dwelling-place.</mark4><br>
<br>
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,<br>
So soft, so calm, yet <mark4>eloquent,</mark4><br>
The smiles that win, the tints that <mark3>glow,</mark3><br>
But tell of days in goodness <mark4>spent,</mark4><br>
A mind at peace with all <mark3>below,</mark3><br>
A heart whose love is <mark4>innocent!</mark4><br>
