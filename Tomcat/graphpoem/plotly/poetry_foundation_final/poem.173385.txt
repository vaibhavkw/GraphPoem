Title : The Sun Rising <br>
Author : John Donne <br><br>

Busy old fool, unruly <mark3>sun,</mark3><br>
Why dost thou <mark3>thus,</mark3><br>
Through windows, and through curtains call on <mark3>us?</mark3><br>
Must to thy motions lovers' seasons <mark3>run?</mark3><br>
Saucy pedantic wretch, go <mark4>chide</mark4><br>
Late school boys and sour prenticesprentices <mark4>apprentices,</mark4><br>
Go tell court huntsmen that the king will ride,the king will ride James I, the king of England at the time of Donne's <mark4>writing</mark4>, had a known passion for riding horses and <mark4>hunting.</mark4><br>
Call country ants to harvest <mark4>offices,</mark4><br>
Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime, <br>
Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time.rags of time a figure of speech meaning that such things are passing and immaterial. Donne uses this phrase in one of his <mark4>sermons.</mark4><br>
<br>
Thy beams, so reverendreverend worthy of high respect and <mark4>strong</mark4><br>
Why shouldst thou <mark3>think?</mark3><br>
I could eclipse and cloud them with a <mark3>wink,</mark3><br>
But that I would not lose her sight so <mark3>long;</mark3><br>
If her eyes have not blinded <mark4>thine,</mark4><br>
Look, and tomorrow late, tell <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
         Whether both th' Indias of spice and mineboth th' Indias of spice and mine the East Indies for spices and the West Indies for gold. In a 1623 letter to Sir Robert Ker, Donne wrote: "Your way into Spain was Eastward, and that is the way to the land of Perfumes and Spices; their way hither is Westward, and that is the way to the land of Gold, and of Mynes." [John Donne: Selected Prose. Edited by Helen Gardner and Timothy Healy, p. 155] <br>
Be where thou leftst them, or lie here with <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
Ask for those kings whom thou saw'st <mark4>yesterday,</mark4><br>
And thou shalt hear, All here in one bed lay. <br>
<br>
               She's all states, and all princes, I, <br>
Nothing else <mark4>is.</mark4><br>
Princes do but play <mark4>us</mark4>, compared to <mark4>this,</mark4><br>
All honor's mimic, all wealth alchemyalchemy figuratively, not the real thing. The speculative practice of alchemy involved a search for chemically turning base metals, such as iron, into highly valuable metals, such as <mark4>gold..</mark4><br>
Thou, sun, art half as happy as <mark3>we,</mark3><br>
In that the world's contracted <mark1>thus.</mark1><br>
Thine age asks ease, and since thy duties <mark3>be</mark3><br>
To warm the world, that's done in warming <mark1>us.</mark1><br>
Shine here to us, and thou art <mark4>everywhere;</mark4><br>
This bed thy center is, these walls, thy <mark4>sphere.</mark4><br>
