Title : A Parable <br>
Author : Dr. Arthur Conan Doyle <br><br>

The cheese-mites asked how the cheese got <mark3>there,</mark3><br>
And warmly debated the <mark3>matter;</mark3><br>
The Orthodox said that it came from the <mark3>air,</mark3><br>
And the Heretics said from the <mark3>platter.</mark3><br>
They argued it long and they argued it strong,<br>
And I hear they are arguing <mark3>now;</mark3><br>
But of all the choice spirits who lived in the cheese,<br>
Not one of them thought of a <mark3>cow.</mark3><br>
