Title : Iambicum Trimetrum <br>
Author : Edmund Spenser <br><br>

Unhappy verse, the witness of my unhappy <mark4>state,</mark4><br>
      Make thy self flutt'ring wings of thy fast flying<br>
      Thought, and fly forth unto my love, wheresoever she be:<br>
Whether lying restless in heavy bed, or <mark1>else</mark1><br>
Sitting so cheerless at the cheerful board, or <mark1>else</mark1><br>
      Playing alone careless on her heavenly virginals.<br>
If in bed, tell her, that my eyes can take no <mark4>rest:</mark4><br>
If at board, tell her, that my mouth can eat no <mark4>meat:</mark4><br>
If at her virginals, tell her, I can hear no <mark1>mirth.</mark1><br>
Asked why? say: waking love suffereth no <mark3>sleep:</mark3><br>
      Say that raging love doth appal the weak stomach:<br>
      Say, that lamenting love marreth the musical.<br>
Tell her, that her pleasures were wont to lull me <mark3>asleep:</mark3><br>
      Tell her, that her beauty was wont to feed mine eyes:<br>
Tell her, that her sweet tongue was wont to make me <mark1>mirth.</mark1><br>
Now do I nightly <mark4>waste</mark4>, wanting my kindly <mark1>rest:</mark1><br>
Now do I daily starve, wanting my lively <mark4>food:</mark4><br>
Now do I always die, wanting thy timely <mark1>mirth.</mark1><br>
And if I waste, who will bewail my heavy <mark4>chance?</mark4><br>
And if I starve, who will record my cursed <mark4>end?</mark4><br>
      And if I die, who will say: "This was Immerito"?<br>
