Title : Earth's Answer <br>
Author : William Blake <br><br>

Earth rais'd up her <mark3>head,</mark3><br>
From the darkness dread & drear. <br>
Her light <mark3>fled:</mark3><br>
Stony <mark3>dread!</mark3><br>
And her locks cover'd with grey <mark4>despair.</mark4><br>
<br>
Prison'd on watry <mark4>shore</mark4><br>
Starry Jealousy does keep my <mark3>den</mark3><br>
Cold and <mark3>hoar</mark3><br>
Weeping o'er <br>
I hear the Father of the ancient <mark3>men</mark3><br>
<br>
Selfish father of <mark1>men</mark1><br>
Cruel, jealous, selfish <mark4>fear</mark4><br>
Can <mark3>delight</mark3><br>
Chain'd in <mark3>night</mark3><br>
The virgins of youth and morning <mark4>bear.</mark4><br>
<br>
Does spring hide its joy <br>
When buds and blossoms grow? <br>
Does the sower? <br>
Sow by <mark1>night?</mark1><br>
Or the plowman in darkness plow? <br>
<br>
Break this heavy <mark4>chain,</mark4><br>
That does freeze my bones <mark4>around</mark4><br>
Selfish! <mark4>vain!</mark4><br>
Eternal <mark3>bane!</mark3><br>
That free Love with bondage <mark3>bound.</mark3><br>
