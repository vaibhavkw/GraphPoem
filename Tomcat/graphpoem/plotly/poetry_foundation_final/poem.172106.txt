Title : The Waking <br>
Author : Theodore Roethke <br><br>

I wake to sleep, and take my waking <mark3>slow.</mark3><br>
I feel my fate in what I cannot <mark3>fear.</mark3><br>
I learn by going where I have to <mark3>go.</mark3><br>
<br>
We think by feeling. What is there to <mark3>know?</mark3><br>
I hear my being dance from ear to <mark3>ear.</mark3><br>
I wake to sleep, and take my waking <mark1>slow.</mark1><br>
<br>
Of those so close beside me, which are <mark3>you?</mark3><br>
God bless the Ground!   I shall walk softly <mark4>there,</mark4><br>
And learn by going where I have to <mark1>go.</mark1><br>
<br>
Light takes the Tree; but who can tell us how?   <br>
The lowly worm climbs up a winding <mark3>stair;</mark3><br>
I wake to sleep, and take my waking <mark1>slow.</mark1><br>
<br>
Great Nature has another thing to <mark3>do</mark3><br>
To you and me; so take the lively <mark3>air,</mark3><br>
And, lovely, learn by going where to <mark1>go.</mark1><br>
<br>
This shaking keeps me steady. I should <mark1>know.</mark1><br>
What falls away is always. And is <mark4>near.</mark4><br>
I wake to sleep, and take my waking <mark1>slow.</mark1><br>
I learn by going where I have to <mark1>go.</mark1><br>
