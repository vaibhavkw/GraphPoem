Title : What the Birds Said <br>
Author : John Greenleaf Whittier <br><br>

The birds against the April <mark3>wind</mark3><br>
Flew northward, singing as they <mark3>flew;</mark3><br>
They sang, "The land we leave <mark3>behind</mark3><br>
Has swords for corn-blades, blood for <mark3>dew."</mark3><br>
<br>
"O wild-birds, flying from the <mark3>South,</mark3><br>
What saw and heard ye, gazing <mark3>down?"</mark3><br>
"We saw the mortar's upturned <mark3>mouth,</mark3><br>
The sickened camp, the blazing <mark3>town!</mark3><br>
<br>
"Beneath the bivouac's starry <mark4>lamps,</mark4><br>
We saw your march-worn children <mark3>die;</mark3><br>
In shrouds of <mark4>moss</mark4>, in cypress <mark4>swamps,</mark4><br>
We saw your dead uncoffined <mark3>lie.</mark3><br>
<br>
"We heard the starving prisoner's <mark4>sighs</mark4><br>
And saw, from line and trench, your <mark4>sons</mark4><br>
Follow our flight with home-sick <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
Beyond the battery's smoking <mark4>guns."</mark4><br>
<br>
"And heard and saw ye only <mark3>wrong</mark3><br>
And pain," I cried, "O wing-worn <mark4>flocks?"</mark4><br>
"We heard," they <mark4>sang</mark4>, "the freedman's <mark3>song,</mark3><br>
The crash of Slavery's broken <mark3>locks!</mark3><br>
<br>
"We saw from new, uprising <mark4>States</mark4><br>
The treason-nursing mischief <mark4>spurned,</mark4><br>
As, crowding Freedom's ample <mark3>gates,</mark3><br>
The long-estranged and lost <mark3>returned.</mark3><br>
<br>
"O'er dusky faces, seamed and <mark4>old,</mark4><br>
And hands horn-hard with unpaid <mark3>toil,</mark3><br>
With hope in every rustling <mark3>fold,</mark3><br>
We saw your star-dropt flag <mark3>uncoil.</mark3><br>
<br>
"And struggling up through sounds accursed,<br>
A grateful murmur clomb the <mark3>air;</mark3><br>
A whisper scarcely heard at <mark4>first,</mark4><br>
It filled the listening heavens with <mark3>prayer.</mark3><br>
<br>
"And sweet and <mark3>far</mark3>, as from a <mark4>star,</mark4><br>
Replied a voice which shall not <mark4>cease,</mark4><br>
Till, drowning all the noise of <mark4>war,</mark4><br>
It sings the blessed song of <mark3>peace!"</mark3><br>
<br>
So to me, in a doubtful <mark3>day</mark3><br>
Of chill and slowly greening <mark4>spring,</mark4><br>
Low stooping from the cloudy <mark3>gray,</mark3><br>
The wild-birds sang or seemed to <mark3>sing.</mark3><br>
<br>
They vanished in the misty <mark1>air,</mark1><br>
The song went with them in their <mark4>flight;</mark4><br>
But lo! they left the sunset <mark3>fair,</mark3><br>
And in the evening there was <mark3>light.</mark3><br>
