Title : Address: the Archaeans, One Cell Creatures <br>
Author : Pattiann Rogers <br><br>

Although most are totally <mark4>naked</mark4><br>
and too scant for even the <mark4>slightest</mark4><br>
color and although they have no <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
that I've ever heard for cry or song, they <mark4>are,</mark4><br>
nevertheless, more than mirage, <mark4>more</mark4><br>
than hallucination, more than <mark4>falsehood.</mark4><br>
<br>
They have confronted sulfuric    <br>
boiling black sea bottoms and <mark4>stayed,</mark4><br>
held on under ten tons of polar <mark4>ice,</mark4><br>
established themselves in dense <mark4>salts</mark4><br>
and <mark4>acids</mark4>, survived eating metal <mark4>ions.</mark4><br>
They are more committed than <mark4>oblivion,</mark4><br>
more prolific than <mark4>stars.</mark4><br>
<br>
Far too ancient for scripture, each   <br>
one bears in its one cell one <mark4>text--</mark4><br>
the first whit of alpha, the <mark4>first</mark4><br>
jot of bearing, beneath the riling    <br>
sun the first nourishing of <mark4>self.</mark4><br>
<br>
Too lavish for saints, too <mark5>trifling</mark5><br>
for baptism, they have <mark4>existed</mark4><br>
throughout never gaining girth <mark4>enough</mark4><br>
to hold a firm hope of <mark4>salvation.</mark4><br>
Too meager in heart for <mark4>compassion,</mark4><br>
too lean for tears, less in <mark4>substance</mark4><br>
than sacrifice, not one has <mark3>ever</mark3><br>
carried a cross <mark4>anywhere.</mark4><br>
<br>
And not one of their <mark4>trillions</mark4><br>
has ever been given a <mark4>tombstone.</mark4><br>
I've never noticed a <mark4>lessening</mark4><br>
of light in the ceasing of any <mark4>one</mark4><br>
of them. They are more mutable    <br>
than mere breathing and <mark4>vanishing,</mark4><br>
more mysterious than <mark4>resurrection,</mark4><br>
too minimal for death.<br>
