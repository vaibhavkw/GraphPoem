Title : None <br>
Author : Hayden Carruth <br><br>

You died. And because you were Greek they gave <mark1>you</mark1><br>
          a coin to carry under your tongue and then also   <br>
biscuits and honey. When you came to the riverbank <br>
you saw a crazy-looking black bumboat on the <mark3>water</mark3><br>
with a figure standing in <mark4>it</mark4>, lanky and <mark4>dressed</mark4><br>
          darkly, holding a sweep. You were taken across, <br>
and you gave your coin for the passage, and <mark4>continued</mark4><br>
until you came to a three-headed dog, who <mark4>snarled</mark4><br>
and threatened you, even though you were not <mark4>trying</mark4><br>
to escape. You gave him the biscuits <mark4>smeared</mark4><br>
with honey, and you passed onward to the <mark4>field</mark4><br>
of asphodel and through the gate of Tartarus. <mark3>Or</mark3><br>
<br>
you died and you were Navajo. They had carried <mark1>you</mark1><br>
out of the hogan earlier so you'd die in the <mark4>sunshine.</mark4><br>
Or if it happened inside suddenly, they stuffed up <br>
the smokehole and boarded the front entrance, and <mark4>cut</mark4><br>
an opening in the back, the <mark3>north-facing</mark3>, <mark4>dark-facing</mark4><br>
side, to carry you out, and no one ever <mark4>used</mark4><br>
that hogan again. They took off your <mark4>moccasins</mark4><br>
and put them on again wrong side to, the left <mark4>one</mark4><br>
on the right foot, the right on the left, so that <mark3>your</mark3><br>
chindi would be confused and unable to <mark4>return</mark4><br>
along your tracks. They washed your hair in <mark4>suds</mark4><br>
made from the yucca. Then they gave <mark1>you</mark1><br>
enough fried bread and water to last four <mark4>days,</mark4><br>
and you set off on your <mark4>journey</mark4>, But <mark4>actually</mark4><br>
<br>
none of these things <mark4>happened</mark4>, You just <mark4>died.</mark4><br>
