Title : Snow-Bound: A Winter Idyl <br>
Author : John Greenleaf Whittier <br><br>

To the Memory of the Household It Describes  This Poem is Dedicated by the Author  "As the Spirits of Darkness be stronger in the dark, so Good Spirits, which be Angels of Light, are augmented not only by the Divine light of the Sun, but also by our common Wood Fire: and as the Celestial Fire drives away dark spirits, so also this our Fire of Wood doth the same." --Cor. Agrippa, Occult Philosophy, Book I.ch. v.   "Announced by all the trumpets of the sky,  Arrives the snow, and, driving o'er the fields,  Seems nowhere to alight: the whited air  Hides hills and woods, the river and the heaven,  And veils the farm-house at the garden's end.  The sled and traveller stopped, the courier's feet  Delayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit  Around the radiant fireplace, enclosed  In a tumultuous privacy of Storm."  EMERSON, The Snow <mark3>Storm.</mark3><br>
The sun that brief December <mark3>day</mark3><br>
Rose cheerless over hills of <mark3>gray,</mark3><br>
And, darkly circled, gave at <mark3>noon</mark3><br>
A sadder light than waning <mark3>moon.</mark3><br>
Slow tracing down the thickening <mark3>sky</mark3><br>
Its mute and ominous <mark4>prophecy,</mark4><br>
A portent seeming less than <mark3>threat,</mark3><br>
It sank from sight before it <mark3>set.</mark3><br>
A chill no <mark4>coat</mark4>, however <mark4>stout,</mark4><br>
Of homespun stuff could quite shut <mark3>out,</mark3><br>
A <mark4>hard</mark4>, dull bitterness of <mark4>cold,</mark4><br>
That checked, mid-vein, the circling <mark3>race</mark3><br>
Of life-blood in the sharpened <mark3>face,</mark3><br>
The coming of the snow-storm <mark3>told.</mark3><br>
The wind blew east; we heard the <mark3>roar</mark3><br>
Of Ocean on his wintry <mark3>shore,</mark3><br>
And felt the strong pulse throbbing <mark4>there</mark4><br>
Beat with low rhythm our inland <mark3>air.</mark3><br>
<br>
Meanwhile we did our nightly <mark3>chores,--</mark3><br>
Brought in the wood from out of <mark3>doors,</mark3><br>
Littered the <mark4>stalls</mark4>, and from the <mark4>mows</mark4><br>
Raked down the herd's-grass for the <mark3>cows;</mark3><br>
Heard the horse whinnying for his <mark4>corn;</mark4><br>
And, sharply clashing horn on <mark3>horn,</mark3><br>
Impatient down the stanchion <mark4>rows</mark4><br>
The cattle shake their walnut <mark3>bows;</mark3><br>
While, peering from his early <mark3>perch</mark3><br>
Upon the scaffold's pole of <mark3>birch,</mark3><br>
The cock his crested helmet <mark4>bent</mark4><br>
And down his querulous challenge <mark3>sent.</mark3><br>
<br>
Unwarmed by any sunset <mark4>light</mark4><br>
The gray day darkened into <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
A night made hoary with the <mark3>swarm</mark3><br>
And whirl-dance of the blinding <mark1>storm,</mark1><br>
As zigzag, wavering to and <mark3>fro,</mark3><br>
Crossed and recrossed the winged <mark3>snow:</mark3><br>
And ere the early bedtime <mark4>came</mark4><br>
The white drift piled the <mark3>window-frame,</mark3><br>
And through the glass the clothes-line <mark4>posts</mark4><br>
Looked in like tall and sheeted <mark3>ghosts.</mark3><br>
<br>
So all night long the storm roared <mark4>on:</mark4><br>
The morning broke without a <mark4>sun;</mark4><br>
In tiny spherule traced with <mark4>lines</mark4><br>
Of Nature's geometric <mark3>signs,</mark3><br>
In starry flake, and pellicle, <br>
All day the hoary meteor <mark3>fell;</mark3><br>
And, when the second morning <mark4>shone,</mark4><br>
We looked upon a world <mark3>unknown,</mark3><br>
On nothing we could call our <mark3>own.</mark3><br>
Around the glistening wonder <mark1>bent</mark1><br>
The blue walls of the firmament, <br>
No cloud above, no earth <mark3>below,--</mark3><br>
A universe of sky and <mark1>snow!</mark1><br>
The old familiar sights of <mark4>ours</mark4><br>
Took marvellous shapes; strange domes and <mark3>towers</mark3><br>
Rose up where sty or corn-crib <mark4>stood,</mark4><br>
Or garden-wall, or belt of <mark3>wood;</mark3><br>
A smooth white mound the brush-pile <mark4>showed,</mark4><br>
A fenceless drift what once was <mark3>road;</mark3><br>
The bridle-post an old man <mark4>sat</mark4><br>
With loose-flung coat and high cocked <mark3>hat;</mark3><br>
The well-curb had a Chinese <mark3>roof;</mark3><br>
And even the long sweep, high <mark3>aloof,</mark3><br>
In its slant splendor, seemed to <mark3>tell</mark3><br>
Of Pisa's leaning <mark4>miracle.</mark4><br>
<br>
A prompt, decisive man, no <mark4>breath</mark4><br>
Our father wasted: "Boys, a <mark4>path!"</mark4><br>
Well pleased, (for when did farmer <mark3>boy</mark3><br>
Count such a summons less than <mark3>joy?)</mark3><br>
Our buskins on our feet we <mark3>drew;</mark3><br>
With mittened hands, and caps drawn <mark3>low,</mark3><br>
To guard our necks and ears from <mark1>snow,</mark1><br>
We cut the solid whiteness <mark3>through.</mark3><br>
And, where the drift was deepest, <mark4>made</mark4><br>
A tunnel walled and <mark4>overlaid</mark4><br>
With dazzling crystal: we had <mark4>read</mark4><br>
Of rare Aladdin's wondrous <mark3>cave,</mark3><br>
And to our own his name we <mark3>gave,</mark3><br>
With many a wish the luck were <mark1>ours</mark1><br>
To test his lamp's supernal <mark3>powers.</mark3><br>
We reached the barn with merry <mark4>din,</mark4><br>
And roused the prisoned brutes <mark3>within.</mark3><br>
The old horse thrust his long head <mark1>out,</mark1><br>
And grave with wonder gazed <mark3>about;</mark3><br>
The cock his lusty greeting <mark3>said,</mark3><br>
And forth his speckled harem <mark3>led;</mark3><br>
The oxen lashed their tails, and <mark4>hooked,</mark4><br>
And mild reproach of hunger <mark3>looked;</mark3><br>
The horned patriarch of the <mark3>sheep,</mark3><br>
Like Egypt's Amun roused from <mark3>sleep,</mark3><br>
Shook his sage head with gesture <mark4>mute,</mark4><br>
And emphasized with stamp of <mark4>foot.</mark4><br>
<br>
All day the gusty north-wind <mark4>bore</mark4><br>
The loosening drift its breath <mark3>before;</mark3><br>
Low circling round its southern <mark4>zone,</mark4><br>
The sun through dazzling snow-mist <mark1>shone.</mark1><br>
No church-bell lent its Christian <mark3>tone</mark3><br>
To the savage air, no social <mark3>smoke</mark3><br>
Curled over woods of snow-hung <mark3>oak.</mark3><br>
A solitude made more <mark4>intense</mark4><br>
By dreary-voiced <mark4>elements,</mark4><br>
The shrieking of the mindless <mark4>wind,</mark4><br>
The moaning tree-boughs swaying <mark3>blind,</mark3><br>
And on the glass the unmeaning <mark4>beat</mark4><br>
Of ghostly finger-tips of <mark3>sleet.</mark3><br>
Beyond the circle of our <mark4>hearth</mark4><br>
No welcome sound of toil or <mark4>mirth</mark4><br>
Unbound the spell, and <mark4>testified</mark4><br>
Of human life and thought <mark4>outside.</mark4><br>
We minded that the sharpest <mark4>ear</mark4><br>
The buried brooklet could not <mark3>hear,</mark3><br>
The music of whose liquid <mark4>lip</mark4><br>
Had been to us <mark4>companionship,</mark4><br>
And, in our lonely life, had <mark3>grown</mark3><br>
To have an almost human <mark1>tone.</mark1><br>
<br>
As night drew on, and, from the <mark4>crest</mark4><br>
Of wooded knolls that ridged the <mark3>west,</mark3><br>
The sun, a snow-blown traveller, <mark4>sank</mark4><br>
From sight beneath the smothering <mark3>bank,</mark3><br>
We piled, with care, our nightly <mark4>stack</mark4><br>
Of wood against the <mark3>chimney-back,--</mark3><br>
The oaken log, green, huge, and <mark4>thick,</mark4><br>
And on its top the stout <mark3>back-stick;</mark3><br>
The knotty forestick laid <mark4>apart,</mark4><br>
And filled between with curious <mark3>art</mark3><br>
The ragged brush; then, hovering <mark4>near,</mark4><br>
We watched the first red blaze <mark3>appear,</mark3><br>
Heard the sharp crackle, caught the <mark4>gleam</mark4><br>
On whitewashed wall and sagging <mark3>beam,</mark3><br>
Until the old, rude-furnished <mark4>room</mark4><br>
Burst, flower-like, into rosy <mark3>bloom;</mark3><br>
While radiant with a mimic <mark4>flame</mark4><br>
Outside the sparkling drift <mark3>became,</mark3><br>
And through the bare-boughed <mark3>lilac-tree</mark3><br>
Our own warm hearth seemed blazing <mark3>free.</mark3><br>
The crane and pendent trammels <mark1>showed,</mark1><br>
The Turks' heads on the andirons <mark3>glowed;</mark3><br>
While childish fancy, prompt to <mark1>tell</mark1><br>
The meaning of the <mark1>miracle,</mark1><br>
Whispered the old rhyme: "Under the <mark3>tree,</mark3><br>
When fire outdoors burns <mark4>merrily,</mark4><br>
There the witches are making <mark3>tea."</mark3><br>
<br>
The moon above the eastern <mark1>wood</mark1><br>
Shone at its full; the hill-range <mark1>stood</mark1><br>
Transfigured in the silver <mark4>flood,</mark4><br>
Its blown snows flashing cold and <mark4>keen,</mark4><br>
Dead white, save where some sharp <mark3>ravine</mark3><br>
Took shadow, or the sombre <mark3>green</mark3><br>
Of hemlocks turned to pitchy <mark4>black</mark4><br>
Against the whiteness at their <mark3>back.</mark3><br>
For such a world and such a <mark1>night</mark1><br>
Most fitting that unwarming <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
Which only seemed where'er it <mark1>fell</mark1><br>
To make the coldness <mark4>visible.</mark4><br>
<br>
Shut in from all the world <mark4>without,</mark4><br>
We sat the clean-winged hearth <mark1>about,</mark1><br>
Content to let the north-wind <mark1>roar</mark1><br>
In baffled rage at pane and <mark3>door,</mark3><br>
While the red logs before us <mark1>beat</mark1><br>
The frost-line back with tropic <mark3>heat;</mark3><br>
And ever, when a louder <mark4>blast</mark4><br>
Shook beam and rafter as it <mark3>passed,</mark3><br>
The merrier up its roaring <mark4>draught</mark4><br>
The great throat of the chimney <mark3>laughed;</mark3><br>
The house-dog on his paws <mark5>outspread</mark5><br>
Laid to the fire his drowsy <mark4>head,</mark4><br>
The cat's dark silhouette on the <mark4>wall</mark4><br>
A couchant tiger's seemed to <mark3>fall;</mark3><br>
And, for the winter fireside <mark4>meet,</mark4><br>
Between the andirons' straddling <mark3>feet,</mark3><br>
The mug of cider simmered <mark3>slow,</mark3><br>
The apples sputtered in a <mark3>row,</mark3><br>
And, close at <mark4>hand</mark4>, the basket <mark1>stood</mark1><br>
With nuts from brown October's <mark1>wood.</mark1><br>
<br>
What matter how the night <mark4>behaved?</mark4><br>
What matter how the north-wind <mark3>raved?</mark3><br>
Blow high, blow <mark3>low</mark3>, not all its <mark1>snow</mark1><br>
Could quench our hearth-fire's ruddy <mark3>glow.</mark3><br>
O Time and Change!--with hair as <mark1>gray</mark1><br>
As was my sire's that winter <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
How strange it seems, with so much <mark4>gone</mark4><br>
Of life and love, to still live <mark1>on!</mark1><br>
Ah, brother! only I and <mark3>thou</mark3><br>
Are left of all that circle <mark3>now,--</mark3><br>
The dear home faces <mark3>whereupon</mark3><br>
That fitful firelight paled and <mark1>shone.</mark1><br>
Henceforward, listen as we <mark4>will,</mark4><br>
The voices of that hearth are <mark3>still;</mark3><br>
Look where we may, the wide earth <mark4>o'er,</mark4><br>
Those lighted faces smile no <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
We tread the paths their feet have <mark4>worn,</mark4><br>
We sit beneath their orchard <mark4>trees,</mark4><br>
We hear, like them, the hum of <mark3>bees</mark3><br>
And rustle of the bladed <mark1>corn;</mark1><br>
We turn the pages that they <mark1>read,</mark1><br>
Their written words we linger <mark1>o'er,</mark1><br>
But in the sun they cast no <mark4>shade,</mark4><br>
No voice is <mark4>heard</mark4>, no sign is <mark1>made,</mark1><br>
No step is on the conscious <mark3>floor!</mark3><br>
Yet Love will dream, and Faith will <mark4>trust,</mark4><br>
(Since He who knows our need is <mark3>just,)</mark3><br>
That somehow, somewhere, meet we <mark3>must.</mark3><br>
Alas for him who never <mark4>sees</mark4><br>
The stars shine through his <mark3>cypress-trees!</mark3><br>
Who, hopeless, lays his dead <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
Nor looks to see the breaking <mark1>day</mark1><br>
Across the mournful marbles <mark3>play!</mark3><br>
Who hath not learned, in hours of <mark4>faith,</mark4><br>
The truth to flesh and sense <mark1>unknown,</mark1><br>
That Life is ever lord of <mark4>Death,</mark4><br>
And Love can never lose its <mark1>own!</mark1><br>
We sped the time with stories <mark4>old,</mark4><br>
Wrought puzzles out, and riddles <mark1>told,</mark1><br>
Or stammered from our school-book <mark3>lore</mark3><br>
"The Chief of Gambia's golden <mark1>shore."</mark1><br>
How often since, when all the <mark4>land</mark4><br>
Was clay in Slavery's shaping <mark3>hand,</mark3><br>
As if a far-blown trumpet <mark4>stirred</mark4><br>
The languorous sin-sick air, I <mark3>heard:</mark3><br>
"Does not the voice of reason <mark3>cry,</mark3><br>
Claim the first right which Nature <mark1>gave,</mark1><br>
From the red scourge of bondage to <mark3>fly,</mark3><br>
Nor deign to live a burdened <mark3>slave!"</mark3><br>
Our father rode again his <mark4>ride</mark4><br>
On Memphremagog's wooded <mark3>side;</mark3><br>
Sat down again to moose and <mark4>samp</mark4><br>
In trapper's hut and Indian <mark3>camp;</mark3><br>
Lived o'er the old idyllic <mark3>ease</mark3><br>
Beneath St. Francois' <mark3>hemlock-trees;</mark3><br>
Again for him the moonlight <mark1>shone</mark1><br>
On Norman cap and bodiced <mark1>zone;</mark1><br>
Again he heard the violin <mark1>play</mark1><br>
Which led the village dance <mark1>away.</mark1><br>
And mingled in its merry <mark4>whirl</mark4><br>
The grandam and the laughing <mark3>girl.</mark3><br>
Or, nearer home, our steps he <mark1>led</mark1><br>
Where Salisbury's level marshes <mark3>spread</mark3><br>
Mile-wide as flies the laden <mark3>bee;</mark3><br>
Where merry mowers, hale and <mark3>strong,</mark3><br>
Swept, scythe on scythe, their swaths <mark3>along</mark3><br>
The low green prairies of the <mark3>sea.</mark3><br>
We shared the fishing off Boar's <mark1>Head,</mark1><br>
And round the rocky Isles of <mark4>Shoals</mark4><br>
The hake-broil on the drift-wood <mark3>coals;</mark3><br>
The chowder on the sand-beach <mark1>made,</mark1><br>
Dipped by the hungry, steaming <mark4>hot,</mark4><br>
With spoons of clam-shell from the <mark3>pot.</mark3><br>
We heard the tales of witchcraft <mark1>old,</mark1><br>
And dream and sign and marvel <mark1>told</mark1><br>
To sleepy listeners as they <mark3>lay</mark3><br>
Stretched idly on the salted <mark3>hay,</mark3><br>
Adrift along the winding <mark4>shores,</mark4><br>
When favoring breezes deigned to <mark3>blow</mark3><br>
The square sail of the <mark5>gundelow</mark5><br>
And idle lay the useless <mark3>oars.</mark3><br>
<br>
Our mother, while she turned her <mark4>wheel</mark4><br>
Or run the new-knit <mark3>stocking-heel,</mark3><br>
Told how the Indian hordes came <mark4>down</mark4><br>
At midnight on Concheco <mark3>town,</mark3><br>
And how her own great-uncle <mark1>bore</mark1><br>
His cruel scalp-mark to <mark5>fourscore.</mark5><br>
Recalling, in her fitting <mark4>phrase,</mark4><br>
So rich and picturesque and <mark1>free</mark1><br>
(The common unrhymed <mark4>poetry</mark4><br>
Of simple life and country <mark3>ways,)</mark3><br>
The story of her early <mark3>days,--</mark3><br>
She made us welcome to her <mark4>home;</mark4><br>
Old hearths grew wide to give us <mark1>room;</mark1><br>
We stole with her a frightened <mark4>look</mark4><br>
At the gray wizard's <mark3>conjuring-book,</mark3><br>
The fame whereof went far and <mark4>wide</mark4><br>
Through all the simple country <mark1>side;</mark1><br>
We heard the hawks at twilight <mark1>play,</mark1><br>
The boat-horn on Piscataqua, <br>
The loon's weird laughter far <mark1>away;</mark1><br>
We fished her little trout-brook, <mark3>knew</mark3><br>
What flowers in wood and meadow <mark3>grew,</mark3><br>
What sunny hillsides <mark3>autumn-brown</mark3><br>
She climbed to shake the ripe nuts <mark1>down,</mark1><br>
Saw where in sheltered cove and <mark3>bay,</mark3><br>
The ducks' black squadron anchored <mark1>lay,</mark1><br>
And heard the wild-geese calling <mark4>loud</mark4><br>
Beneath the gray November <mark3>cloud.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then, haply, with a look more <mark3>grave,</mark3><br>
And soberer tone, some tale she <mark1>gave</mark1><br>
From painful Sewel's ancient <mark4>tome,</mark4><br>
Beloved in every Quaker <mark1>home,</mark1><br>
Of faith fire-winged by <mark4>martyrdom,</mark4><br>
Or Chalkley's Journal, old and <mark4>quaint,--</mark4><br>
Gentlest of skippers, rare <mark3>sea-saint!--</mark3><br>
Who, when the dreary calms <mark4>prevailed,</mark4><br>
And water-butt and bread-cask <mark3>failed,</mark3><br>
And cruel, hungry eyes <mark4>pursued</mark4><br>
His portly presence mad for <mark3>food,</mark3><br>
With dark hints muttered under <mark1>breath</mark1><br>
Of casting lots for life or <mark1>death,</mark1><br>
Offered, if Heaven withheld <mark4>supplies,</mark4><br>
To be himself the <mark4>sacrifice.</mark4><br>
Then, suddenly, as if to <mark3>save</mark3><br>
The good man from his living <mark1>grave,</mark1><br>
A ripple on the water <mark1>grew,</mark1><br>
A school of porpoise flashed in <mark3>view.</mark3><br>
"Take, eat," he said, "and be <mark4>content;</mark4><br>
These fishes in my stead are <mark1>sent</mark1><br>
By Him who gave the tangled <mark4>ram</mark4><br>
To spare the child of <mark4>Abraham."</mark4><br>
<br>
Our uncle, innocent of <mark4>books,</mark4><br>
Was rich in lore of fields and <mark3>brooks,</mark3><br>
The ancient teachers never <mark4>dumb</mark4><br>
Of Nature's unhoused lyceum. <br>
In moons and tides and weather <mark3>wise,</mark3><br>
He read the clouds as <mark4>prophecies,</mark4><br>
And foul or fair could well <mark4>divine,</mark4><br>
By many an occult hint and <mark3>sign,</mark3><br>
Holding the cunning-warded <mark4>keys</mark4><br>
To all the woodcraft <mark4>mysteries;</mark4><br>
Himself to Nature's heart so <mark1>near</mark1><br>
That all her voices in his <mark1>ear</mark1><br>
Of beast or bird had meanings <mark3>clear,</mark3><br>
Like Apollonius of <mark1>old,</mark1><br>
Who knew the tales the sparrows <mark1>told,</mark1><br>
Or Hermes, who <mark4>interpreted</mark4><br>
What the sage cranes of Nilus <mark1>said;</mark1><br>
A simple, guileless, childlike <mark4>man,</mark4><br>
Content to live where life <mark3>began;</mark3><br>
Strong only on his native <mark4>grounds,</mark4><br>
The little world of sights and <mark3>sounds</mark3><br>
Whose girdle was the parish <mark3>bounds,</mark3><br>
Whereof his fondly partial <mark4>pride</mark4><br>
The common features <mark4>magnified,</mark4><br>
As Surrey hills to mountains <mark1>grew</mark1><br>
In White of Selborne's loving <mark1>view,--</mark1><br>
He told how teal and loon he <mark4>shot,</mark4><br>
And how the eagle's eggs he <mark3>got,</mark3><br>
The feats on pond and river <mark4>done,</mark4><br>
The prodigies of rod and <mark3>gun;</mark3><br>
Till, warming with the tales he <mark1>told,</mark1><br>
Forgotten was the outside <mark1>cold,</mark1><br>
The bitter wind unheeded <mark3>blew,</mark3><br>
From ripening corn the pigeons <mark3>flew,</mark3><br>
The partridge drummed i' the wood, the <mark4>mink</mark4><br>
Went fishing down the <mark3>river-brink.</mark3><br>
In fields with bean or clover <mark3>gay,</mark3><br>
The woodchuck, like a hermit <mark1>gray,</mark1><br>
Peered from the doorway of his <mark4>cell;</mark4><br>
The muskrat plied the mason's <mark4>trade,</mark4><br>
And tier by tier his mud-walls <mark3>laid;</mark3><br>
And from the shagbark <mark4>overhead</mark4><br>
The grizzled squirrel dropped his <mark3>shell.</mark3><br>
<br>
Next, the dear aunt, whose smile of <mark3>cheer</mark3><br>
And voice in dreams I see and <mark1>hear,--</mark1><br>
The sweetest woman ever <mark4>Fate</mark4><br>
Perverse denied a household <mark3>mate,</mark3><br>
Who, lonely, <mark4>homeless</mark4>, not the <mark4>less</mark4><br>
Found peace in love's unselfishness, <br>
And welcome wheresoe'er she <mark4>went,</mark4><br>
A calm and gracious <mark4>element,</mark4><br>
Whose presence seemed the sweet <mark4>income</mark4><br>
And womanly atmosphere of <mark1>home,--</mark1><br>
Called up her girlhood <mark4>memories,</mark4><br>
The huskings and the <mark4>apple-bees,</mark4><br>
The sleigh-rides and the summer <mark4>sails,</mark4><br>
Weaving through all the poor <mark3>details</mark3><br>
And homespun warp of <mark4>circumstance</mark4><br>
A golden woof-thread of <mark4>romance.</mark4><br>
For well she kept her genial <mark4>mood</mark4><br>
And simple faith of maidenhood; <br>
Before her still a cloud-land <mark1>lay,</mark1><br>
The mirage loomed across her <mark3>way;</mark3><br>
The morning dew, that dries so <mark4>soon</mark4><br>
With others, glistened at her <mark1>noon;</mark1><br>
Through years of toil and soil and <mark4>care,</mark4><br>
From glossy tress to thin gray <mark3>hair,</mark3><br>
All unprofaned she held <mark1>apart</mark1><br>
The virgin fancies of the <mark3>heart.</mark3><br>
Be shame to him of woman <mark4>born</mark4><br>
Who hath for such but thought of <mark3>scorn.</mark3><br>
<br>
There, too, our elder sister <mark4>plied</mark4><br>
Her evening task the stand <mark3>beside;</mark3><br>
A full, rich nature, free to <mark1>trust,</mark1><br>
Truthful and almost sternly <mark1>just,</mark1><br>
Impulsive, <mark4>earnest</mark4>, prompt to <mark4>act,</mark4><br>
And make her generous thought a <mark3>fact,</mark3><br>
Keeping with many a light <mark4>disguise</mark4><br>
The secret of <mark4>self-sacrifice.</mark4><br>
O heart sore-tried! thou hast the <mark4>best</mark4><br>
That Heaven itself could give <mark5>thee,--rest,</mark5><br>
Rest from all bitter thoughts and <mark4>things!</mark4><br>
How many a poor one's blessing <mark1>went</mark1><br>
With thee beneath the low green <mark3>tent</mark3><br>
Whose curtain never outward <mark3>swings!</mark3><br>
<br>
As one who held herself a <mark4>part</mark4><br>
Of all she saw, and let her <mark1>heart</mark1><br>
Against the household bosom <mark4>lean,</mark4><br>
Upon the motley-braided <mark4>mat</mark4><br>
Our youngest and our dearest <mark1>sat,</mark1><br>
Lifting her large, sweet, asking <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
Now bathed in the unfading <mark1>green</mark1><br>
And holy peace of <mark3>Paradise.</mark3><br>
Oh, looking from some heavenly <mark4>hill,</mark4><br>
Or from the shade of saintly <mark4>palms,</mark4><br>
Or silver reach of river <mark3>calms,</mark3><br>
Do those large eyes behold me <mark1>still?</mark1><br>
With me one little year <mark3>ago:--</mark3><br>
The chill weight of the winter <mark1>snow</mark1><br>
For months upon her grave has <mark4>lain;</mark4><br>
And now, when summer south-winds <mark1>blow</mark1><br>
And brier and harebell bloom <mark3>again,</mark3><br>
I tread the pleasant paths we <mark4>trod,</mark4><br>
I see the violet-sprinkled <mark3>sod</mark3><br>
Whereon she leaned, too frail and <mark4>weak</mark4><br>
The hillside flowers she loved to <mark3>seek,</mark3><br>
Yet following me where'er I <mark1>went</mark1><br>
With dark eyes full of love's <mark1>content.</mark1><br>
The birds are glad; the brier-rose <mark4>fills</mark4><br>
The air with sweetness; all the <mark3>hills</mark3><br>
Stretch green to June's unclouded <mark1>sky;</mark1><br>
But still I wait with ear and <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
For something gone which should be <mark3>nigh,</mark3><br>
A loss in all familiar <mark1>things,</mark1><br>
In flower that <mark4>blooms</mark4>, and bird that <mark3>sings.</mark3><br>
And yet, dear heart! remembering <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
Am I not richer than of <mark1>old?</mark1><br>
Safe in thy <mark4>immortality,</mark4><br>
What change can reach the wealth I <mark3>hold?</mark3><br>
What chance can mar the pearl and <mark3>gold</mark3><br>
Thy love hath left in trust with <mark3>me?</mark3><br>
And while in life's late <mark4>afternoon,</mark4><br>
Where cool and long the shadows <mark3>grow,</mark3><br>
I walk to meet the night that <mark1>soon</mark1><br>
Shall shape and shadow <mark3>overflow,</mark3><br>
I cannot feel that thou art <mark4>far,</mark4><br>
Since near at need the angels <mark3>are;</mark3><br>
And when the sunset gates unbar, <br>
Shall I not see thee waiting <mark4>stand,</mark4><br>
And, white against the evening <mark3>star,</mark3><br>
The welcome of thy beckoning <mark1>hand?</mark1><br>
<br>
Brisk wielder of the birch and <mark4>rule,</mark4><br>
The master of the district <mark3>school</mark3><br>
Held at the fire his favored <mark4>place,</mark4><br>
Its warm glow lit a laughing <mark1>face</mark1><br>
Fresh-hued and fair, where scarce <mark4>appeared</mark4><br>
The uncertain prophecy of <mark3>beard.</mark3><br>
He teased the mitten-blinded <mark4>cat,</mark4><br>
Played cross-pins on my uncle's <mark1>hat,</mark1><br>
Sang <mark4>songs</mark4>, and told us what <mark4>befalls</mark4><br>
In classic Dartmouth's college <mark3>halls.</mark3><br>
Born the wild Northern hills <mark4>among,</mark4><br>
From whence his yeoman father <mark3>wrung</mark3><br>
By patient toil subsistence <mark4>scant,</mark4><br>
Not competence and yet not <mark4>want,</mark4><br>
He early gained the power to <mark3>pay</mark3><br>
His cheerful, self-reliant <mark1>way;</mark1><br>
Could doff at ease his scholar's <mark4>gown</mark4><br>
To peddle wares from town to <mark1>town;</mark1><br>
Or through the long vacation's <mark4>reach</mark4><br>
In lonely lowland districts <mark3>teach,</mark3><br>
Where all the droll experience <mark4>found</mark4><br>
At stranger hearths in boarding <mark3>round,</mark3><br>
The moonlit skater's keen <mark4>delight,</mark4><br>
The sleigh-drive through the frosty <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
The rustic party, with its <mark4>rough</mark4><br>
Accompaniment of <mark4>blind-man's-buff,</mark4><br>
And whirling-plate, and forfeits <mark4>paid,</mark4><br>
His winter task a pastime <mark1>made.</mark1><br>
Happy the snow-locked homes <mark4>wherein</mark4><br>
He tuned his merry <mark3>violin,</mark3><br>
Or played the athlete in the <mark4>barn,</mark4><br>
Or held the good dame's <mark3>winding-yarn,</mark3><br>
Or mirth-provoking versions <mark1>told</mark1><br>
Of classic legends rare and <mark1>old,</mark1><br>
Wherein the scenes of Greece and <mark3>Rome</mark3><br>
Had all the commonplace of <mark1>home,</mark1><br>
And little seemed at best the <mark4>odds</mark4><br>
'Twixt Yankee pedlers and old <mark3>gods;</mark3><br>
Where Pindus-born Arachthus <mark4>took</mark4><br>
The guise of any grist-mill <mark3>brook,</mark3><br>
And dread Olympus at his <mark1>will</mark1><br>
Became a huckleberry <mark1>hill.</mark1><br>
<br>
A careless boy that night he <mark4>seemed;</mark4><br>
But at his desk he had the <mark1>look</mark1><br>
And air of one who wisely <mark3>schemed,</mark3><br>
And hostage from the future <mark1>took</mark1><br>
In trained thought and lore of <mark3>book.</mark3><br>
Large-brained, clear-eyed, of such as <mark3>he</mark3><br>
Shall Freedom's young apostles <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
Who, following in War's bloody <mark4>trail,</mark4><br>
Shall every lingering wrong <mark3>assail;</mark3><br>
All chains from limb and spirit <mark4>strike,</mark4><br>
Uplift the black and white <mark3>alike;</mark3><br>
Scatter before their swift <mark4>advance</mark4><br>
The darkness and the <mark4>ignorance,</mark4><br>
The pride, the lust, the squalid <mark4>sloth,</mark4><br>
Which nurtured Treason's monstrous <mark3>growth,</mark3><br>
Made murder pastime, and the <mark4>hell</mark4><br>
Of prison-torture <mark4>possible;</mark4><br>
The cruel lie of caste <mark4>refute,</mark4><br>
Old forms remould, and <mark4>substitute</mark4><br>
For Slavery's lash the freeman's <mark1>will,</mark1><br>
For blind routine, wise-handed <mark3>skill;</mark3><br>
A school-house plant on every <mark1>hill,</mark1><br>
Stretching in radiate nerve-lines <mark4>thence</mark4><br>
The quick wires of <mark4>intelligence;</mark4><br>
Till North and South together <mark4>brought</mark4><br>
Shall own the same electric <mark3>thought,</mark3><br>
In peace a common flag <mark4>salute,</mark4><br>
And, side by side in labor's <mark1>free</mark1><br>
And unresentful <mark4>rivalry,</mark4><br>
Harvest the fields wherein they <mark4>fought.</mark4><br>
<br>
Another guest that winter <mark1>night</mark1><br>
Flashed back from lustrous eyes the <mark1>light.</mark1><br>
Unmarked by time, and yet not <mark3>young,</mark3><br>
The honeyed music of her <mark3>tongue</mark3><br>
And words of meekness scarcely <mark1>told</mark1><br>
A nature passionate and <mark3>bold,</mark3><br>
Strong, self-concentred, spurning <mark4>guide,</mark4><br>
Its milder features dwarfed <mark1>beside</mark1><br>
Her unbent will's majestic <mark1>pride.</mark1><br>
She sat among us, at the <mark1>best,</mark1><br>
A not unfeared, half-welcome <mark3>guest,</mark3><br>
Rebuking with her cultured <mark1>phrase</mark1><br>
Our homeliness of words and <mark1>ways.</mark1><br>
A certain pard-like, treacherous <mark4>grace</mark4><br>
Swayed the lithe limbs and drooped the <mark3>lash,</mark3><br>
Lent the white teeth their dazzling <mark3>flash;</mark3><br>
And under low brows, black with <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
Rayed out at times a dangerous <mark1>light;</mark1><br>
The sharp heat-lightnings of her <mark1>face</mark1><br>
Presaging ill to him whom <mark1>Fate</mark1><br>
Condemned to share her love or <mark3>hate.</mark3><br>
A woman tropical, <mark1>intense</mark1><br>
In thought and act, in soul and <mark3>sense,</mark3><br>
She blended in a like <mark3>degree</mark3><br>
The vixen and the <mark3>devotee,</mark3><br>
Revealing with each freak or <mark4>feint</mark4><br>
The temper of Petruchio's <mark4>Kate,</mark4><br>
The raptures of Siena's <mark4>saint.</mark4><br>
Her tapering hand and rounded <mark4>wrist</mark4><br>
Had facile power to form a <mark3>fist;</mark3><br>
The warm, dark languish of her <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
Was never safe from wrath's <mark3>surprise.</mark3><br>
Brows saintly calm and lips <mark4>devout</mark4><br>
Knew every change of scowl and <mark3>pout;</mark3><br>
And the sweet voice had notes more <mark3>high</mark3><br>
And shrill for social <mark3>battle-cry.</mark3><br>
<br>
Since then what old cathedral <mark1>town</mark1><br>
Has missed her pilgrim staff and <mark1>gown,</mark1><br>
What convent-gate has held its <mark4>lock</mark4><br>
Against the challenge of her <mark3>knock!</mark3><br>
Through Smyrna's plague-hushed <mark4>thoroughfares,</mark4><br>
Up sea-set Malta's rocky <mark4>stairs,</mark4><br>
Gray olive slopes of hills that <mark4>hem</mark4><br>
Thy tombs and shrines, <mark4>Jerusalem,</mark4><br>
Or startling on her desert <mark4>throne</mark4><br>
The crazy Queen of <mark4>Lebanon</mark4><br>
With claims fantastic as her <mark1>own,</mark1><br>
Her tireless feet have held their <mark1>way;</mark1><br>
And still, unrestful, bowed, and <mark1>gray,</mark1><br>
She watches under Eastern <mark4>skies,</mark4><br>
With hope each day renewed and <mark4>fresh,</mark4><br>
The Lord's quick coming in the <mark3>flesh,</mark3><br>
Whereof she dreams and <mark4>prophesies!</mark4><br>
<br>
Where'er her troubled path may <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
The Lord's sweet pity with her <mark3>go!</mark3><br>
The outward wayward life we <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
The hidden springs we may not <mark3>know.</mark3><br>
Nor is it given us to <mark4>discern</mark4><br>
What threads the fatal sisters <mark4>spun,</mark4><br>
Through what ancestral years has <mark3>run</mark3><br>
The sorrow with the woman <mark1>born,</mark1><br>
What forged her cruel chain of <mark4>moods,</mark4><br>
What set her feet in solitudes, <br>
And held the love within her <mark1>mute,</mark1><br>
What mingled madness in the <mark4>blood,</mark4><br>
A life-long discord and <mark3>annoy,</mark3><br>
Water of tears with oil of <mark1>joy,</mark1><br>
And hid within the folded <mark3>bud</mark3><br>
Perversities of flower and <mark3>fruit.</mark3><br>
It is not ours to <mark4>separate</mark4><br>
The tangled skein of will and <mark1>fate,</mark1><br>
To show what metes and bounds should <mark1>stand</mark1><br>
Upon the soul's debatable <mark1>land,</mark1><br>
And between choice and <mark4>Providence</mark4><br>
Divide the circle of <mark4>events;</mark4><br>
But He who knows our frame is <mark1>just,</mark1><br>
Merciful and <mark4>compassionate,</mark4><br>
And full of sweet <mark4>assurances</mark4><br>
And hope for all the language <mark3>is,</mark3><br>
That He remembereth we are <mark4>dust!</mark4><br>
<br>
At last the great logs, crumbling <mark1>low,</mark1><br>
Sent out a dull and duller <mark1>glow,</mark1><br>
The bull's-eye watch that hung in <mark1>view,</mark1><br>
Ticking its weary circuit <mark1>through,</mark1><br>
Pointed with mutely warning <mark1>sign</mark1><br>
Its black hand to the hour of <mark3>nine.</mark3><br>
That sign the pleasant circle <mark4>broke:</mark4><br>
My uncle ceased his pipe to <mark1>smoke,</mark1><br>
Knocked from its bowl the refuse <mark1>gray,</mark1><br>
And laid it tenderly <mark1>away;</mark1><br>
Then roused himself to safely <mark3>cover</mark3><br>
The dull red brands with ashes <mark4>over.</mark4><br>
And while, with care, our mother <mark1>laid</mark1><br>
The work <mark4>aside</mark4>, her steps she <mark3>stayed</mark3><br>
One moment, seeking to <mark4>express</mark4><br>
Her grateful sense of <mark4>happiness</mark4><br>
For food and shelter, warmth and <mark4>health,</mark4><br>
And love's contentment more than <mark3>wealth,</mark3><br>
With simple wishes (not the <mark1>weak,</mark1><br>
Vain prayers which no fulfilment <mark1>seek,</mark1><br>
But such as warm the generous <mark1>heart,</mark1><br>
O'er-prompt to do with Heaven its <mark1>part)</mark1><br>
That none might lack, that bitter <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
For bread and clothing, warmth and <mark1>light.</mark1><br>
<br>
Within our beds awhile we <mark1>heard</mark1><br>
The wind that round the gables <mark4>roared,</mark4><br>
With now and then a ruder <mark4>shock,</mark4><br>
Which made our very bedsteads <mark3>rock.</mark3><br>
We heard the loosened clapboards <mark1>tost,</mark1><br>
The board-nails snapping in the <mark4>frost;</mark4><br>
And on us, through the unplastered <mark1>wall,</mark1><br>
Felt the light sifted snow-flakes <mark1>fall.</mark1><br>
But sleep stole on, as sleep will <mark3>do</mark3><br>
When hearts are light and life is <mark3>new;</mark3><br>
Faint and more faint the murmurs <mark1>grew,</mark1><br>
Till in the summer-land of <mark4>dreams</mark4><br>
They softened to the sound of <mark3>streams,</mark3><br>
Low stir of <mark4>leaves</mark4>, and dip of <mark1>oars,</mark1><br>
And lapsing waves on quiet <mark1>shores.</mark1><br>
<br>
Next morn we wakened with the <mark4>shout</mark4><br>
Of merry voices high and <mark1>clear;</mark1><br>
And saw the teamsters drawing <mark1>near</mark1><br>
To break the drifted highways <mark1>out.</mark1><br>
Down the long hillside treading <mark1>slow</mark1><br>
We saw the half-buried oxen <mark1>go,</mark1><br>
Shaking the snow from heads uptost, <br>
Their straining nostrils white with <mark1>frost.</mark1><br>
Before our door the straggling <mark4>train</mark4><br>
Drew up, an added team to <mark3>gain.</mark3><br>
The elders threshed their hands <mark4>a-cold,</mark4><br>
Passed, with the cider-mug, their <mark4>jokes</mark4><br>
From lip to lip; the younger <mark3>folks</mark3><br>
Down the loose snow-banks, wrestling, <mark3>rolled,</mark3><br>
Then toiled again the <mark4>cavalcade</mark4><br>
O'er windy hill, through clogged <mark1>ravine,</mark1><br>
And woodland paths that wound <mark3>between</mark3><br>
Low drooping pine-boughs <mark4>winter-weighed.</mark4><br>
From every barn a team <mark4>afoot,</mark4><br>
At every house a new <mark4>recruit,</mark4><br>
Where, drawn by Nature's subtlest <mark3>law,</mark3><br>
Haply the watchful young men <mark3>saw</mark3><br>
Sweet doorway pictures of the <mark4>curls</mark4><br>
And curious eyes of merry <mark3>girls,</mark3><br>
Lifting their hands in mock <mark4>defence</mark4><br>
Against the snow-ball's <mark4>compliments,</mark4><br>
And reading in each missive <mark1>tost</mark1><br>
The charm with Eden never <mark4>lost.</mark4><br>
<br>
We heard once more the sleigh-bells' <mark4>sound;</mark4><br>
<mark4>And</mark4>, following where the teamsters <mark1>led,</mark1><br>
The wise old Doctor went his <mark1>round,</mark1><br>
Just pausing at our door to <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
In the brief autocratic <mark1>way</mark1><br>
Of one who, prompt at Duty's <mark3>call,</mark3><br>
Was free to urge her claim on <mark3>all,</mark3><br>
That some poor neighbor sick <mark4>abed</mark4><br>
At night our mother's aid would <mark4>need.</mark4><br>
For, one in generous thought and <mark3>deed,</mark3><br>
What mattered in the sufferer's <mark4>sight</mark4><br>
The Quaker matron's inward <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
The Doctor's mail of Calvin's <mark3>creed?</mark3><br>
All hearts confess the saints <mark4>elect</mark4><br>
Who, twain in faith, in love <mark3>agree,</mark3><br>
And melt not in an acid <mark3>sect</mark3><br>
The Christian pearl of <mark4>charity!</mark4><br>
<br>
So days went on: a week had <mark1>passed</mark1><br>
Since the great world was heard from <mark3>last.</mark3><br>
The Almanac we studied <mark1>o'er,</mark1><br>
Read and reread our little <mark4>store</mark4><br>
Of books and pamphlets, scarce a <mark3>score;</mark3><br>
One harmless novel, mostly <mark4>hid</mark4><br>
From younger eyes, a book <mark3>forbid,</mark3><br>
And poetry, (or good or <mark4>bad,</mark4><br>
A single book was all we <mark3>had,)</mark3><br>
Where Ellwood's meek, drab-skirted <mark4>Muse,</mark4><br>
A stranger to the heathen <mark1>Nine,</mark1><br>
Sang, with a somewhat nasal <mark3>whine,</mark3><br>
The wars of David and the <mark3>Jews.</mark3><br>
At last the floundering carrier <mark1>bore</mark1><br>
The village paper to our <mark1>door.</mark1><br>
Lo! broadening outward as we <mark1>read,</mark1><br>
To warmer zones the horizon <mark1>spread</mark1><br>
In panoramic length <mark4>unrolled</mark4><br>
We saw the marvels that it <mark1>told.</mark1><br>
Before us passed the painted <mark4>Creeks,</mark4><br>
And daft McGregor on his <mark4>raids</mark4><br>
In Costa Rica's <mark4>everglades.</mark4><br>
And up Taygetos winding <mark1>slow</mark1><br>
Rode Ypsilanti's Mainote <mark3>Greeks,</mark3><br>
A Turk's head at each <mark3>saddle-bow!</mark3><br>
Welcome to us its week-old <mark4>news,</mark4><br>
Its corner for the rustic <mark1>Muse,</mark1><br>
Its monthly gauge of snow and <mark4>rain,</mark4><br>
Its record, mingling in a <mark1>breath</mark1><br>
The wedding bell and dirge of <mark1>death:</mark1><br>
Jest, anecdote, and love-lorn <mark4>tale,</mark4><br>
The latest culprit sent to <mark3>jail;</mark3><br>
Its hue and cry of stolen and <mark1>lost,</mark1><br>
Its vendue sales and goods at <mark3>cost,</mark3><br>
And traffic calling loud for <mark1>gain.</mark1><br>
We felt the stir of hall and <mark4>street,</mark4><br>
The pulse of life that round us <mark1>beat;</mark1><br>
The chill embargo of the <mark1>snow</mark1><br>
Was melted in the genial <mark1>glow;</mark1><br>
Wide swung again our ice-locked <mark1>door,</mark1><br>
And all the world was ours once <mark1>more!</mark1><br>
<br>
Clasp, Angel of the backword <mark1>look</mark1><br>
And folded wings of ashen <mark1>gray</mark1><br>
And voice of echoes far <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
The brazen covers of thy <mark1>book;</mark1><br>
The weird palimpsest old and <mark4>vast,</mark4><br>
Wherein thou hid'st the spectral <mark3>past;</mark3><br>
Where, closely mingling, pale and <mark1>glow</mark1><br>
The characters of joy and <mark3>woe;</mark3><br>
The monographs of outlived <mark4>years,</mark4><br>
Or smile-illumed or dim with <mark3>tears,</mark3><br>
Green hills of life that slope to <mark1>death,</mark1><br>
And haunts of home, whose vistaed <mark1>trees</mark1><br>
Shade off to mournful <mark5>cypresses</mark5><br>
With the white amaranths <mark4>underneath.</mark4><br>
Even while I look, I can but <mark4>heed</mark4><br>
The restless sands' incessant <mark1>fall,</mark1><br>
Importunate hours that hours <mark3>succeed,</mark3><br>
Each clamorous with its own sharp <mark1>need,</mark1><br>
And duty keeping pace with <mark1>all.</mark1><br>
Shut down and clasp with heavy <mark4>lids;</mark4><br>
I hear again the voice that <mark3>bids</mark3><br>
The dreamer leave his dream midway <br>
For larger hopes and graver <mark4>fears:</mark4><br>
Life greatens in these later <mark1>years,</mark1><br>
The century's aloe flowers <mark3>to-day!</mark3><br>
<br>
Yet, haply, in some lull of <mark4>life,</mark4><br>
Some Truce of God which breaks its <mark3>strife,</mark3><br>
The worldling's eyes shall gather <mark3>dew,</mark3><br>
Dreaming in throngful city <mark1>ways</mark1><br>
Of winter joys his boyhood <mark1>knew;</mark1><br>
And dear and early friends--the <mark3>few</mark3><br>
Who yet remain--shall pause to <mark1>view</mark1><br>
These Flemish pictures of old <mark1>days;</mark1><br>
Sit with me by the homestead <mark1>hearth,</mark1><br>
And stretch the hands of memory <mark4>forth</mark4><br>
To warm them at the wood-fire's <mark3>blaze!</mark3><br>
And thanks untraced to lips <mark1>unknown</mark1><br>
Shall greet me like the odors <mark3>blown</mark3><br>
From unseen meadows newly <mark5>mown,</mark5><br>
Or lilies floating in some <mark4>pond,</mark4><br>
Wood-fringed, the wayside gaze <mark3>beyond;</mark3><br>
The traveller owns the grateful <mark1>sense</mark1><br>
Of sweetness near, he knows not <mark3>whence,</mark3><br>
And, pausing, takes with forehead <mark4>bare</mark4><br>
The benediction of the <mark1>air.</mark1><br>
