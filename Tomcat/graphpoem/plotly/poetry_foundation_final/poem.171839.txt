Title : Spree <br>
Author : Maxine W. Kumin <br><br>

My father paces the upstairs <mark4>hall</mark4><br>
a large confined <mark4>animal</mark4><br>
neither wild nor yet <mark4>domesticated.</mark4><br>
About him hangs the smell of righteous <mark3>wrath.</mark3><br>
My mother is meekly <mark4>seated</mark4><br>
at the escritoire. Rosy from my <mark3>bath</mark3><br>
age eight-nine-ten by now I <mark4>understand</mark4><br>
his right to roar, hers to <mark3>defy</mark3><br>
the bill from Wanamaker's in his <mark3>hand</mark3><br>
the bill from Strawbridge's held <mark3>high</mark3><br>
the bill from Bonwit <mark4>Teller</mark4><br>
and the all plum-colored Blum <mark4>Store.</mark4><br>
<br>
His anger smells like dinner <mark4>parties</mark4><br>
like trays of frothy daiquiris. <br>
Against the pre-World-War-Two <mark4>prime</mark4><br>
standing ribs his carving <mark4>knife</mark4><br>
flashes a little drunkenly. He <mark4>charms</mark4><br>
all the other Bonwit-bedecked <mark4>wives</mark4><br>
but something overripe malingers. <br>
I wear his wide cigar bands on my <mark4>fingers.</mark4><br>
<br>
Oh God it is so <mark4>noisy!</mark4><br>
Under my bed a secret <mark4>stair</mark4><br>
a gold and purple <mark4>escalator</mark4><br>
takes me nightly down under the <mark5>sea.</mark5><br>
Such dancings, such carryings on   <br>
with the prince of <mark4>this-or-that</mark4><br>
with the duke of ne'er-do-well <br>
I the plain one, a size too large to <mark4>tell</mark4><br>
grow tremulous at stickpin and cravat   <br>
I in toe shoes and tutu <mark4>suddenly</mark4><br>
see shopping is an art <mark4>form</mark4><br>
a kind of costume <mark4>ball.</mark4><br>
<br>
Papa, would we so humbly <mark4>come</mark4><br>
to the scene in the upstairs <mark1>hall</mark1><br>
on the first of every month, <mark4>except</mark4><br>
you chose the mice for footmen, <mark4>clapped</mark4><br>
to call up the coach and <mark3>four?</mark3><br>
You sent to Paris for the ermine <mark4>muff</mark4><br>
that says I'm rich. To think twelve <mark4>poor</mark4><br>
little things had their heads chopped <mark4>off</mark4><br>
to keep my hands unseemly <mark4>warm!</mark4><br>
When you went fishing down the <mark4>well</mark4><br>
for fox <mark4>furs</mark4>, hats with peacock <mark4>plumes</mark4><br>
velvet evening capes, what else <mark3>befell?</mark3><br>
<br>
You paid the bills, Papa. You cast the <mark3>spell.</mark3><br>
