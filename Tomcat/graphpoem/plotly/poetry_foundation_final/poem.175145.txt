Title : Fate <br>
Author : Ralph Waldo Emerson <br><br>

That you are fair or wise is <mark3>vain,</mark3><br>
Or strong, or rich, or <mark4>generous;</mark4><br>
You must have also the untaught <mark3>strain</mark3><br>
That sheds beauty on the <mark4>rose.</mark4><br>
There is a melody born of melody,<br>
Which melts the world into a <mark3>sea:</mark3><br>
Toil could never compass <mark3>it;</mark3><br>
Art its height could never <mark3>hit;</mark3><br>
It came never out of <mark3>wit;</mark3><br>
But a music <mark4>music-born</mark4><br>
Well may Jove and Juno <mark3>scorn.</mark3><br>
Thy beauty, if it lack the <mark3>fire</mark3><br>
Which drives me mad with sweet <mark3>desire,</mark3><br>
What boots it? what the soldier's <mark3>mail,</mark3><br>
Unless he conquer and <mark3>prevail?</mark3><br>
What all the goods thy pride which <mark4>lift,</mark4><br>
If thou pine for another's <mark3>gift?</mark3><br>
Alas! that one is born in <mark4>blight,</mark4><br>
Victim of perpetual <mark3>slight:</mark3><br>
When thou lookest on his <mark4>face,</mark4><br>
Thy heart saith, "Brother, go thy <mark4>ways!</mark4><br>
None shall ask thee what thou doest,<br>
Or care a rush for what thou knowest,<br>
Or listen when thou repliest,<br>
Or remember where thou liest,<br>
Or how thy supper is <mark4>sodden;"</mark4><br>
And another is <mark4>born</mark4><br>
To make the sun <mark4>forgotten.</mark4><br>
Surely he carries a <mark4>talisman</mark4><br>
Under his <mark4>tongue;</mark4><br>
Broad are his shoulders, and <mark4>strong;</mark4><br>
And his eye is <mark4>scornful,</mark4><br>
<mark4>Threatening</mark4>, and <mark4>young.</mark4><br>
I hold it of little <mark4>matter</mark4><br>
Whether your jewel be of pure <mark4>water,</mark4><br>
A rose diamond or a <mark3>white,</mark3><br>
But whether it dazzle me with <mark3>light.</mark3><br>
I care not how you are <mark4>dressed,</mark4><br>
In the coarsest or in the <mark3>best;</mark3><br>
Nor whether your name is base or brave;<br>
Nor for the fashion of your <mark4>behavior;</mark4><br>
But whether you charm <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
Bid my bread feed and my fire warm <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
And dress up Nature in your <mark4>favor.</mark4><br>
One thing is forever <mark4>good;</mark4><br>
That one thing is Success, <mark4>?</mark4><br>
Dear to the Eumenides,<br>
And to all the heavenly <mark4>brood.</mark4><br>
Who bides at home, nor looks <mark4>abroad,</mark4><br>
Carries the eagles, and masters the <mark4>sword.</mark4><br>
