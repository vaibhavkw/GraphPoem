Title : It Is There <br>
Author : Babette Deutsch <br><br>

These are the streets where we walked with war and <mark4>childhood</mark4><br>
Like our two shadows behind us, <mark4>or</mark4><br>
Before us like one shadow. <br>
River <mark4>walks</mark4><br>
Threaded by park <mark4>rats</mark4>, flanked by <mark4>battleships,</mark4><br>
Flickering of a grey tail on the <mark4>bank,</mark4><br>
Motionless <mark4>hulls</mark4><br>
Enormous under a dead grey <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
Farther, the harbor and the miscolored <mark4>waters</mark4><br>
Rocking their flotsam under the blank round <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
At the masthead staring down the rats to <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
Beyond the fisher <mark4>gulls.</mark4><br>
And the windows full of ropes and <mark4>hardware,</mark4><br>
Doorways, barreled, yawning on the <mark4>dark,</mark4><br>
Wall-eyed <mark4>alleys</mark4>, coils of husky <mark4>smells,</mark4><br>
The breath of journeys strong <mark4>there.</mark4><br>
Streets whose sordid <mark4>beauty</mark4><br>
                                        joked readily with hope. <br>
The taller <mark4>avenues,</mark4><br>
And walls that smiled like unpurchased <mark4>horizons,</mark4><br>
Swung intimate views out of a foreign <mark4>room,</mark4><br>
Hung a gate upon a garden's fable, <br>
Walls that <mark4>frowned</mark4><br>
With aged remorseless <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
Or the gloom of thunderlit landscapes, <mark4>opening</mark4><br>
A door into that placeless <mark4>country</mark4><br>
Where the sad animal is blithe, free and at <mark4>home.</mark4><br>
Too, those <mark4>halls</mark4><br>
Where we stepped lightly among the <mark4>creatures</mark4><br>
Whom death had tamed, who yet crouched, sprang, or flew, <br>
Fierce as hunger, graceful as joy, <br>
Until we knew, as in a half silvered mirror, the <mark5>half</mark5><br>
Captive image of <mark4>immortality.</mark4><br>
These are the old places, and walking <mark1>there</mark1><br>
As then with war and childhood, I look into the shadows' <mark4>faces.</mark4><br>
They appal. <br>
                Yet often I will see <br>
(The marvels floating alive upon that <mark4>stream,</mark4><br>
The breathing of delight like purest <mark3>air)</mark3><br>
Another place: that you <mark4>contrived</mark4><br>
Between midnight and <mark4>morning</mark4><br>
In your dream, and in the <mark1>morning</mark1><br>
Took me <mark1>there.</mark1><br>
                     We greeted it, who could not stay. <br>
But it is <mark1>there,</mark1><br>
Surviving disbelief, surviving even what the malign years <mark3>prepare.</mark3><br>
