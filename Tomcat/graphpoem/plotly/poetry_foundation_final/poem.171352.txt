Title : The True-Blue American <br>
Author : Delmore Schwartz <br><br>

Jeremiah Dickson was a true-blue <mark4>American,</mark4><br>
For he was a little boy who understood America, for he felt that he <mark4>must</mark4><br>
Think about everything; because that's all there is to think <mark4>about,</mark4><br>
Knowing immediately the intimacy of truth and <mark4>comedy,</mark4><br>
Knowing intuitively how a sense of humor was a <mark4>necessity</mark4><br>
For one and for all who live in America. Thus, natively, <mark4>and</mark4><br>
Naturally when on an April Sunday in an ice cream parlor Jeremiah   <br>
Was requested to choose between a chocolate sundae and a banana <mark4>split</mark4><br>
He answered unhesitatingly, having no need to think of <mark3>it</mark3><br>
Being a true-blue <mark4>American</mark4>, determined to continue as he <mark4>began:</mark4><br>
Rejecting the either-or of Kierkegaard, and many another <mark4>European;</mark4><br>
Refusing to accept alternatives, refusing to believe the choice of <mark4>between;</mark4><br>
Rejecting selection; denying dilemma; electing absolute affirmation: knowing <br>
in his <mark4>breast</mark4><br>
The infinite and the <mark4>gold</mark4><br>
Of the endless frontier, the deathless <mark3>West.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Both: I will have them both!" declared this true-blue <mark1>American</mark1><br>
In Cambridge, Massachusetts, on an April Sunday, <mark4>instructed</mark4><br>
By the great department stores, by the <mark4>Five-and-Ten,</mark4><br>
Taught by Christmas, by the circus, by the vulgarity and grandeur of <br>
Niagara Falls and the Grand <mark4>Canyon,</mark4><br>
Tutored by the grandeur, vulgarity, and infinite appetite gratified <mark1>and</mark1><br>
Shining in the darkness, of the <mark4>light</mark4><br>
On Saturdays at the double bills of the moon pictures, <br>
The consummation of the advertisements of the imagination of the <mark1>light</mark1><br>
Which is as it was--the infinite belief in infinite hope--of Columbus,   <br>
Barnum, <mark4>Edison</mark4>, and Jeremiah <mark4>Dickson.</mark4><br>
