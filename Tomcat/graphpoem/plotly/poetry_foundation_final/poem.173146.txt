Title : Fortuna <br>
Author : Thomas Carlyle <br><br>

The wind blows <mark4>east</mark4>, the wind blows <mark4>west,</mark4><br>
And the frost falls and the <mark4>rain:</mark4><br>
A weary heart went thankful to <mark3>rest,</mark3><br>
And must rise to toil <mark3>again</mark3>, <mark4>'gain,</mark4><br>
And must rise to toil <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
<br>
The wind blows <mark4>east</mark4>, the wind blows <mark1>west,</mark1><br>
And there comes good luck and <mark3>bad;</mark3><br>
The thriftiest man is the cheerfulest; <br>
'Tis a thriftless thing to be <mark1>sad</mark1>, <mark3>sad,</mark3><br>
'Tis a thriftless thing to be <mark1>sad.</mark1><br>
<br>
The wind blows <mark4>east</mark4>, the wind blows <mark1>west;</mark1><br>
Ye shall know a tree by its <mark4>fruit:</mark4><br>
This world, they say, is worst to the <mark4>best;--</mark4><br>
But a dastard has evil to <mark1>boot</mark1>, <mark4>boot,</mark4><br>
But a dastard has evil to <mark1>boot.</mark1><br>
<br>
The wind blows <mark4>east</mark4>, the wind blows <mark1>west;</mark1><br>
What skills it to mourn or to <mark3>talk?</mark3><br>
A journey I have, and far ere I <mark1>rest;</mark1><br>
I must bundle my wallets and <mark1>walk</mark1>, <mark3>walk,</mark3><br>
I must bundle my wallets and <mark1>walk.</mark1><br>
<br>
The wind does blow as it lists alway; <br>
Canst thou change this world to thy <mark4>mind?</mark4><br>
The world will wander its own wise way; <br>
I also will wander <mark1>mine</mark1>, <mark4>mine,</mark4><br>
I also will wander <mark1>mine.</mark1><br>
