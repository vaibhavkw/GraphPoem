Title : Crossing 16 <br>
Author : Rabindranath Tagore <br><br>

<br>
You came to my door in the dawn and sang; it angered me to be awakened from sleep, and you went away unheeded.<br>
You came in the noon and asked for water; it vexed me in my work, and you were sent away with reproaches.<br>
You came in the evening with your flaming torches.<br>
You seemed to me like a terror and I shut my door.<br>
Now in the midnight I sit alone in my lampless room and call you back whom I turned away in insult.<br>
