Title : Better or Worse <br>
Author : Heather McHugh <br><br>

<br>
Daily, the kindergarteners   <br>
passed my porch. I <mark4>loved</mark4><br>
their likeness and <mark4>variety,</mark4><br>
their selves in line like <mark4>little</mark4><br>
monosyllables, but huggable-- <br>
I wasn't <mark4>meant</mark4><br>
to grab them, <mark1>ever,</mark1><br>
<br>
up into actual besmooches or <mark4>down</mark4><br>
into grubbiest tumbles, my lot was <mark4>not</mark4><br>
to have them, in the <mark5>flesh.</mark5><br>
Was it better or worse to <mark4>let</mark4><br>
their lovability go by <mark4>untouched</mark4>, and <mark4>just</mark4><br>
watch over their river of <mark1>ever-</mark1><br>
inbraiding relations? I <mark4>wouldn't</mark4><br>
mother them or teach. We couldn't <mark4>be</mark4><br>
each other's others; <mark3>maybe,</mark3><br>
at removes, each other's each. <br>
Each toddler had a hand-hold <mark4>on</mark4><br>
<br>
a loop of rope, designed to <mark4>haul</mark4><br>
<br>
the whole school <mark4>onward</mark4><br>
in the sidewalk <mark4>stream--</mark4><br>
like pickerel through freshets, <br>
at the pull of something else's will, the <mark4>children</mark4><br>
spun and bobbled, three years old and four <br>
(or were they little drunken Buddhas, <br>
buoyant, plump?). They <mark4>looked</mark4><br>
now to the right, now to the sky, and now <br>
toward nothing (nothing was too <mark3>small)--</mark3><br>
they followed a thread of <mark4>destination,</mark4><br>
chain of <mark4>command</mark4>, order of actual rope that <mark4>led</mark4><br>
to what? Who knew? <br>
For here and now in one child's eye there was a yellow truck, <br>
<br>
and in another's was a burning star; but from my own perspective, <br>
<br>
overhead, adult, where trucks and suns had lost their <mark4>luster,</mark4><br>
they were one whole baby-rush <mark4>toward</mark4><br>
a target, toward the <mark3>law</mark3><br>
of targets, <mark5>fledge</mark5><br>
in the wake of an <mark4>arrowhead;</mark4><br>
a bull's-eye <mark4>bloomed</mark4>, a <mark4>red</mark4><br>
eight-sided sign. <mark4>What</mark4><br>
<br>
did I wish <mark4>them?</mark4><br>
Nothing I <mark3>foresaw.</mark3><br>
