Title : The Little Walls Before China <br>
Author : A. F. Moritz <br><br>

A courtier speaks to Ch'in Shih-huang-ti, ca. 210 B.C.<br>
Highness, the former walls were helpless. They <br>
stood alone in the middle of small <mark4>fields</mark4><br>
protecting <mark4>nothing</mark4>, A single peasant's <mark4>holding</mark4><br>
engulfed each one as it ran briefly, <mark4>straight</mark4><br>
from noplace off to noplace, with ruinous <mark4>steps</mark4><br>
of broken stone at both ends. Only <mark3>head-high,</mark3><br>
without the towers, gates and towns of your great <mark4>wall,</mark4><br>
they stuck where they were, never rising over <mark4>hills</mark4><br>
or curving through valleys: nothing but shoddy <mark4>masonry</mark4><br>
and a mystery: who built them, how long <mark3>ago,</mark3><br>
what for? They seemed to have no role but <mark4>balking</mark4><br>
the reaper and the ox; their bases <mark4>made</mark4><br>
islands in the flashing scythe-strokes, where wild <mark4>flowers</mark4><br>
and shrubs <mark4>sprouted.</mark4><br>
<br>
So all the people praise <mark5>you</mark5><br>
for burying such walls and their <mark4>memory</mark4><br>
in your vast one, which joins them, stretching <mark4>far</mark4><br>
beyond where they once crumbled to hold your <mark4>Empire:</mark4><br>
a wall which therefore can never have an <mark4>end</mark4><br>
but has to go on extending itself <mark4>forever.</mark4><br>
How <mark4>useful</mark4>, how cogent your wall is: a <mark4>pale</mark4><br>
for the civilized, a dike against the wild <mark4>people</mark4><br>
<mark4>outside</mark4>, who trade their quiet human <mark4>blood</mark4><br>
for the rage of <mark4>gods</mark4>, tearing men to <mark4>pieces,</mark4><br>
throwing them, watching them fall. In <mark4>burying</mark4><br>
those little walls, Lord, you have covered our <mark4>shame</mark4><br>
at our ancestors, best forgotten, whose mighty <mark4>works</mark4><br>
were so <mark4>pointless</mark4>, or so pitiably <mark4>useless.</mark4><br>
Was all their effort so that daisies could grow in <mark4>fissures?</mark4><br>
So that some human work would rise over the <mark4>flats</mark4><br>
and weather till it seemed not human? <mark4>Only</mark4><br>
so that something of ours could be like trees and <mark4>rocks:</mark4><br>
docile-seeming, yet sullenly <mark4>opposed</mark4><br>
to use, and when compelled, only half <mark4>serving,</mark4><br>
reserving from the functions that we give <mark4>them</mark4><br>
a secret and idle self. The peasants would <mark4>make</mark4><br>
lean-tos for cattle against those walls: they <mark4>served</mark4><br>
for this <mark4>alone.</mark4><br>
<br>
Now scholars, Lord, are <mark4>saying</mark4><br>
the gods are not bulls and <mark4>cows</mark4>, That in ancient <mark4>times</mark4><br>
we herded these animals to keep from <mark4>starving</mark4><br>
and going naked, and so came the old <mark4>custom</mark4><br>
of thinking them gods--from dependence. In my <mark5>youth,</mark5><br>
I know, the peasants said just the <mark4>opposite.</mark4><br>
Worship came first. The awesome bull and cow <br>
were gathered to be adored more <mark4>easily,</mark4><br>
till people noticed how they let <mark4>themselves</mark4><br>
be driven and penned. Next came the first <mark4>murders</mark4><br>
against these gods, and the careful <mark4>observation</mark4><br>
that they stood to be killed. And so their cult <mark4>became</mark4><br>
contempt of beings that would live with <mark4>us</mark4><br>
and submit to our crimes and hunger, and we <mark4>began</mark4><br>
to breed them. That is why, the farmer <mark4>says,</mark4><br>
cattle are honoured, murdered, eaten, <mark4>cherished</mark4><br>
with labour that makes him their slave, and that is <mark3>why</mark3><br>
in summer he exults in blood, but shivers with <mark4>fear,</mark4><br>
with exhausted terror and regret, and sinks <mark3>into</mark3><br>
stunned revelry all winter, eating the salted <mark4>meat,</mark4><br>
getting children, his house closed up with <mark3>snow,</mark3><br>
himself awake as if he slept, <mark4>living</mark4><br>
as if he had already died, and rich, <mark4>happy</mark4><br>
as if he were a buried <mark4>worm.</mark4><br>
<br>
Is <mark4>God,</mark4><br>
then, Highness, the fat flaccidity of <mark4>cattle?</mark4><br>
Myself, I don't like to wonder <mark4>anymore.</mark4><br>
I only hope lifelong service earns what I <mark4>ask:</mark4><br>
the command of some far bastion on your <mark1>wall</mark1><br>
where it curves out into the unsettled <mark4>wastes</mark4><br>
beyond any <mark4>field</mark4>, and the barrenness <mark4>inside</mark4><br>
is indistinguishable from that <mark4>without.</mark4><br>
This is the reward and end of life I <mark4>want:</mark4><br>
to be a point, though infinitely <mark3>small</mark3><br>
and far from you, in that wide circle centred <br>
on your great self. I see myself <mark4>arriving</mark4><br>
to take charge of my troops. I look down from the <mark4>tower:</mark4><br>
bare plains, outcrops of ice and rock, vast <mark4>restless</mark4><br>
stirrings of grey grasses and dark-veined <mark4>overcast,</mark4><br>
the cold wind's hissing. Year after year the <mark4>same,</mark4><br>
waiting for an assault that never <mark4>comes,</mark4><br>
straining to glimpse our naked <mark4>enemies</mark4><br>
creeping blended with their stony soil: <mark4>nothing</mark4><br>
but legend, it may be. Maybe a <mark4>morning</mark4><br>
will rise when, waking, I find that I've <mark4>forgotten</mark4><br>
which way is north, and can't tell if I am <mark4>turned</mark4><br>
outward to danger or inward, Highness, to <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
The sun invisible, a murky light <mark4>diffused</mark4><br>
throughout featureless cloud, and the wall so <mark4>long</mark4><br>
no curve appears--it seems to stretch out <mark1>straight</mark1><br>
endlessly east and west: what clue will there <mark4>be</mark4><br>
which way to face my people for the <mark4>attack?</mark4><br>
It will be crucial then to show no <mark4>doubt.</mark4><br>
My orders, I vow, though ignorant, will be crisp.<br>
