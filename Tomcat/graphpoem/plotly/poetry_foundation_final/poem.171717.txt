Title : A Fixed Idea <br>
Author : Amy Lowell <br><br>

What torture lurks within a single <mark3>thought</mark3><br>
When grown too constant; and however <mark3>kind,</mark3><br>
However welcome still, the weary <mark3>mind</mark3><br>
Aches with its presence. Dull remembrance <mark3>taught</mark3><br>
Remembers on unceasingly; unsought   <br>
The old delight is with us but to <mark3>find</mark3><br>
That all recurring joy is pain <mark3>refined,</mark3><br>
Become a habit, and we struggle, <mark3>caught.</mark3><br>
You lie upon my heart as on a <mark4>nest,</mark4><br>
Folded in peace, for you can never <mark3>know</mark3><br>
How crushed I am with having you at <mark3>rest</mark3><br>
Heavy upon my life. I love you <mark3>so</mark3><br>
You bind my freedom from its rightful <mark3>quest.</mark3><br>
In mercy lift your drooping wings and <mark3>go.</mark3><br>
