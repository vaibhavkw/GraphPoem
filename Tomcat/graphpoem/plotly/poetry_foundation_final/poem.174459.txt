Title : from The Faerie Queene: Book I, Canto I <br>
Author : Edmund Spenser <br><br>

Lo I the man, whose Muse whilome did <mark4>maske,</mark4><br>
As time her taught in lowly Shepheards <mark3>weeds,</mark3><br>
Am now enforst a far unfitter taske, <br>
For trumpets sterne to chaunge mine Oaten <mark3>reeds,</mark3><br>
And sing of Knights and Ladies gentle <mark3>deeds;</mark3><br>
Whose prayses having slept in silence <mark3>long,</mark3><br>
Me, all too meane, the sacred Muse areeds <br>
To blazon broad emongst her learned <mark3>throng:</mark3><br>
Fierce warres and faithful loves shall moralize my <mark3>song.</mark3><br>
Helpe <mark4>then</mark4>, O holy Virgin chiefe of <mark4>nine,</mark4><br>
Thy weaker Novice to performe thy <mark3>will,</mark3><br>
Lay forth out of thine everlasting scryne <br>
The antique rolles, which there lye hidden <mark3>still,</mark3><br>
Of Faerie knights and fairest Tanaquill, <br>
Whom that most noble Briton Prince so <mark1>long</mark1><br>
Sought through the world, and suffered so much <mark3>ill,</mark3><br>
That I must rue his undeserved <mark3>wrong:</mark3><br>
O helpe thou my weake wit, and sharpen my dull <mark3>tong.</mark3><br>
And thou most dreaded impe of highest Jove, <br>
Faire Venus sonne, that with thy cruell <mark3>dart</mark3><br>
At that good knight so cunningly didst <mark4>rove,</mark4><br>
That glorious fire it kindled in his <mark3>hart,</mark3><br>
Lay now thy deadly Heben bow <mark3>apart,</mark3><br>
And with thy mother milde come to mine <mark1>ayde:</mark1><br>
Come both, and with you bring triumphant <mark3>Mart,</mark3><br>
In loves and gentle jollities <mark5>arrayd,</mark5><br>
After his murdrous spoiles and bloudy rage <mark5>allayd.</mark5><br>
And with them eke, O Goddesse heavenly <mark4>bright,</mark4><br>
Mirrour of grace and Majestie <mark3>divine,</mark3><br>
Great Lady of the greatest Isle, whose <mark3>light</mark3><br>
Like Phoebus lampe throughout the world doth <mark3>shine,</mark3><br>
Shed thy faire beames into my feeble eyne, <br>
And raise my thoughts too humble and too <mark4>vile,</mark4><br>
To thinke of that true glorious type of <mark3>thine,</mark3><br>
The argument of mine afflicted <mark3>stile:</mark3><br>
The which to heare, vouchsafe, O dearest dred <mark3>a-while.</mark3><br>
<br>
A Gentle Knight was pricking on the <mark5>plaine,</mark5><br>
Y cladd in mightie armes and silver <mark5>shielde,</mark5><br>
Wherein old dints of deepe wounds did <mark1>remaine,</mark1><br>
The cruell markes of many a bloudy fielde; <br>
Yet armes till that time did he never <mark3>wield:</mark3><br>
His angry steede did chide his foming bitt, <br>
As much disdayning to the curbe to <mark3>yield:</mark3><br>
Full jolly knight he seemd, and faire did sitt, <br>
As one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters <mark4>fitt.</mark4><br>
But on his brest a bloudie Crosse he <mark3>bore,</mark3><br>
<br>
The deare remembrance of his dying <mark4>Lord,</mark4><br>
For whose sweete sake that glorious badge he <mark3>wore,</mark3><br>
And dead as living ever him <mark4>ador'd:</mark4><br>
Upon his shield the like was also <mark3>scor'd,</mark3><br>
For soveraine hope, which in his helpe he <mark4>had:</mark4><br>
Right faithfull true he was in deede and <mark4>word,</mark4><br>
But of his cheere did seeme too solemne <mark4>sad;</mark4><br>
Yet nothing did he dread, but ever was ydrad. <br>
Upon a great adventure he was <mark4>bond,</mark4><br>
That greatest Gloriana to him <mark4>gave,</mark4><br>
<br>
That greatest Glorious Queene of Faerie <mark5>lond,</mark5><br>
To winne him worship, and her grace to <mark4>have,</mark4><br>
Which of all earthly things he most did <mark4>crave;</mark4><br>
And ever as he rode, his hart did earne <br>
To prove his puissance in battell <mark3>brave</mark3><br>
Upon his foe, and his new force to <mark5>learne;</mark5><br>
Upon his foe, a Dragon horrible and <mark4>stearne.</mark4><br>
A lovely Ladie rode him faire <mark4>beside,</mark4><br>
Upon a lowly Asse more white then <mark3>snow,</mark3><br>
Yet she much whiter, but the same did <mark3>hide</mark3><br>
<br>
Under a vele, that wimpled was full <mark3>low,</mark3><br>
And over all a blacke stole she did <mark3>throw,</mark3><br>
As one that inly mournd: so was she <mark1>sad,</mark1><br>
And heavie sat upon her palfrey <mark3>slow;</mark3><br>
Seemed in heart some hidden care she <mark1>had,</mark1><br>
And by her in a line a milke white lambe she <mark3>lad.</mark3><br>
So pure an innocent, as that same <mark4>lambe,</mark4><br>
She was in life and every vertuous <mark3>lore,</mark3><br>
And by descent from Royall lynage <mark4>came</mark4><br>
Of ancient Kings and Queenes, that had of <mark3>yore</mark3><br>
<br>
Their scepters stretcht from East to Westerne <mark3>shore,</mark3><br>
And all the world in their subjection <mark4>held;</mark4><br>
Till that infernall feend with foule uprore <br>
Forwasted all their land, and them expeld: <br>
Whom to avenge, she had this Knight from far compeld. <br>
Behind her farre away a Dwarfe did <mark3>lag,</mark3><br>
That lasie seemd in being ever <mark4>last,</mark4><br>
Or wearied with bearing of her <mark3>bag</mark3><br>
Of needments at his backe. Thus as they <mark3>past,</mark3><br>
The day with cloudes was suddeine <mark4>overcast,</mark4><br>
<br>
And angry Jove an hideous storme of <mark4>raine</mark4><br>
Did poure into his Lemans lap so <mark4>fast,</mark4><br>
That every wight to shrowd it did <mark3>constrain,</mark3><br>
And this faire couple eke to shroud themselves were <mark3>fain.</mark3><br>
Enforst to seeke some covert nigh at <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
A shadie grove not far away they <mark5>spide,</mark5><br>
That promist ayde the tempest to <mark3>withstand:</mark3><br>
Whose loftie trees yclad with sommers <mark4>pride,</mark4><br>
Did spred so <mark4>broad</mark4>, that heavens light did <mark1>hide,</mark1><br>
Not perceable with power of any <mark5>starre:</mark5><br>
<br>
And all within were pathes and alleies <mark3>wide,</mark3><br>
With footing worne, and leading inward <mark5>farre:</mark5><br>
Faire harbour that them seemes; so in they entred <mark5>arre.</mark5><br>
And foorth they passe, with pleasure forward <mark4>led,</mark4><br>
Joying to heare the birdes sweete <mark5>harmony,</mark5><br>
Which therein shrouded from the tempest <mark3>dred,</mark3><br>
Seemd in their song to scorne the cruell <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
Much can they prayse the trees so straight and <mark3>hy,</mark3><br>
The sayling Pine, the Cedar proud and <mark4>tall,</mark4><br>
The vine-prop Elme, the Poplar never <mark3>dry,</mark3><br>
<br>
The builder Oake, sole king of forrests <mark3>all,</mark3><br>
The Aspine good for staves, the Cypresse funerall. <br>
The Laurell, meed of mightie Conquerours <br>
And Poets sage, the Firre that weepeth <mark1>still,</mark1><br>
The Willow worne of forlorne Paramours, <br>
The Eugh obedient to the benders <mark1>will,</mark1><br>
The Birch for shaftes, the Sallow for the <mark3>mill,</mark3><br>
The Mirrhe sweete bleeding in the bitter <mark4>wound,</mark4><br>
The warlike Beech, the Ash for nothing <mark1>ill,</mark1><br>
The fruitfull Olive, and the Platane <mark3>round,</mark3><br>
<br>
The carver Holme, the Maple seeldom inward <mark3>sound.</mark3><br>
Led with delight, they thus beguile the <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
Untill the blustring storme is <mark5>overblowne;</mark5><br>
When weening to returne, whence they did <mark3>stray,</mark3><br>
They cannot find that path, which first was <mark5>showne,</mark5><br>
But wander too and fro in wayes unknowne, <br>
Furthest from end then, when they neerest <mark5>weene,</mark5><br>
That makes them doubt, their wits be not their owne: <br>
So many pathes, so many turnings <mark5>seene,</mark5><br>
That which of them to take, in diverse doubt they <mark4>been.</mark4><br>
<br>
At last resolving forward still to <mark4>fare,</mark4><br>
Till that some end they finde or in or <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
That path they take, that beaten seemd most <mark3>bare,</mark3><br>
And like to lead the labyrinth <mark3>about;</mark3><br>
Which when by tract they hunted had <mark3>throughout,</mark3><br>
At length it brought them to a hollow <mark3>cave,</mark3><br>
Amid the thickest woods. The Champion <mark3>stout</mark3><br>
Eftsoones dismounted from his courser <mark1>brave,</mark1><br>
And to the Dwarfe a while his needlesse spere he <mark1>gave.</mark1><br>
Be well aware, quoth then that Ladie <mark5>milde,</mark5><br>
<br>
Least suddaine mischiefe ye too rash <mark4>provoke:</mark4><br>
The danger <mark4>hid</mark4>, the place unknowne and <mark4>wilde,</mark4><br>
Breeds dreadfull doubts: Oft fire is without <mark3>smoke,</mark3><br>
And perill without show: therefore your <mark3>stroke</mark3><br>
Sir knight <mark4>with-hold</mark4>, till further triall <mark4>made.</mark4><br>
Ah Ladie (said he) shame were to <mark3>revoke</mark3><br>
The forward footing for an hidden <mark3>shade:</mark3><br>
Vertue gives her selfe light, through darkenesse for to <mark3>wade.</mark3><br>
Yea but (quoth she) the perill of this <mark5>place</mark5><br>
I better wot then you, though now too <mark4>late</mark4><br>
<br>
To wish you backe returne with foule <mark3>disgrace,</mark3><br>
Yet wisedome warnes, whilest foot is in the <mark3>gate,</mark3><br>
To stay the steppe, ere forced to <mark5>retrate.</mark5><br>
This is the wandring wood, this Errours <mark4>den,</mark4><br>
A monster vile, whom God and man does <mark3>hate:</mark3><br>
Therefore I read beware. Fly fly (quoth <mark3>then</mark3><br>
The fearefull Dwarfe:) this is no place for living <mark3>men.</mark3><br>
But full of fire and greedy <mark5>hardiment,</mark5><br>
The youthfull knight could not for ought be <mark5>staide,</mark5><br>
But forth unto the darksome hole he <mark4>went,</mark4><br>
<br>
And looked in: his glistring armor <mark1>made</mark1><br>
A litle glooming light, much like a <mark1>shade,</mark1><br>
By which he saw the ugly monster <mark1>plaine,</mark1><br>
Halfe like a serpent horribly <mark5>displaide,</mark5><br>
But th'other halfe did womans shape <mark5>retaine,</mark5><br>
Most lothsom, filthie, foule, and full of vile <mark5>disdaine.</mark5><br>
And as she lay upon the durtie <mark4>ground,</mark4><br>
Her huge long taile her den all <mark5>overspred,</mark5><br>
Yet was in knots and many boughtes upwound, <br>
Pointed with mortall sting. Of her there <mark4>bred</mark4><br>
<br>
A thousand yong ones, which she dayly <mark3>fed,</mark3><br>
Sucking upon her poisonous dugs, eachone <br>
Of sundry shapes, yet all ill <mark4>favored:</mark4><br>
Soone as that uncouth light upon them <mark4>shone,</mark4><br>
Into her mouth they crept, and suddain all were <mark4>gone.</mark4><br>
Their dam upstart, out of her den effraide, <br>
And rushed forth, hurling her hideous taile <br>
About her cursed head, whose folds <mark5>displaid</mark5><br>
Were stretcht now forth at length without entraile. <br>
She lookt about, and seeing one in <mark4>mayle</mark4><br>
<br>
Armed to point, sought backe to turne <mark1>againe;</mark1><br>
For light she hated as the deadly <mark3>bale,</mark3><br>
Ay wont in desert darknesse to <mark1>remaine,</mark1><br>
Where plaine none might her see, nor she see any <mark1>plaine.</mark1><br>
Which when the valiant Elfe perceiv'd, he lept <br>
As Lyon fierce upon the flying <mark3>pray,</mark3><br>
And with his trenchand blade her boldly <mark4>kept</mark4><br>
From turning backe, and forced her to <mark3>stay:</mark3><br>
Therewith enrag'd she loudly gan to <mark3>bray,</mark3><br>
And turning fierce, her speckled taile <mark5>advaunst,</mark5><br>
<br>
Threatning her angry sting, him to <mark3>dismay:</mark3><br>
Who nought aghast, his mightie hand enhaunst: <br>
The stroke down from her head unto her shoulder <mark5>glaunst.</mark5><br>
Much daunted with that dint, her sence was dazd, <br>
Yet kindling rage, her selfe she gathered <mark1>round,</mark1><br>
And all attonce her beastly body <mark5>raizd</mark5><br>
With doubled forces high above the <mark1>ground:</mark1><br>
Tho wrapping up her wrethed sterne <mark5>arownd,</mark5><br>
Lept fierce upon his shield, and her huge <mark1>traine</mark1><br>
All suddenly about his body <mark1>wound,</mark1><br>
<br>
That hand or foot to stirre he strove in <mark1>vaine:</mark1><br>
God helpe the man so wrapt in Errours endlesse <mark1>traine.</mark1><br>
His Lady sad to see his sore <mark4>constraint,</mark4><br>
Cride out, Now now Sir knight, shew what ye <mark5>bee,</mark5><br>
Add faith unto your force, and be not <mark3>faint:</mark3><br>
Strangle her, else she sure will strangle <mark3>thee.</mark3><br>
That when he heard, in great perplexitie, <br>
His gall did grate for griefe and high <mark1>disdaine,</mark1><br>
And knitting all his force got one hand <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
Wherewith he grypt her gorge with so great <mark4>paine,</mark4><br>
<br>
That soone to loose her wicked bands did her <mark5>constraine.</mark5><br>
Therewith she spewd out of her filthy maw <br>
A floud of poyson horrible and <mark5>blacke,</mark5><br>
Full of great lumpes of flesh and gobbets <mark3>raw,</mark3><br>
Which stunck so vildly, that it forst him slacke <br>
His grasping hold, and from her turne him <mark4>backe:</mark4><br>
Her vomit full of bookes and papers <mark4>was,</mark4><br>
With loathly frogs and toades, which eyes did lacke, <br>
And creeping sought way in the weedy <mark3>gras:</mark3><br>
Her filthy parbreake all the place defiled <mark4>has.</mark4><br>
<br>
As when old father Nilus gins to <mark4>swell</mark4><br>
With timely pride above the Aegyptian <mark4>vale,</mark4><br>
His fattie waves do fertile slime <mark5>outwell,</mark5><br>
And overflow each plaine and lowly <mark3>dale:</mark3><br>
But when his later spring gins to avale, <br>
Huge heapes of mudd he leaves, wherein there <mark4>breed</mark4><br>
Ten thousand kindes of creatures, partly <mark3>male</mark3><br>
And partly female of his fruitfull <mark3>seed;</mark3><br>
Such ugly monstrous shapes elsewhere may no man <mark3>reed.</mark3><br>
The same so sore annoyed has the <mark4>knight,</mark4><br>
<br>
That welnigh choked with the deadly <mark5>stinke,</mark5><br>
His forces faile, ne can no longer <mark3>fight.</mark3><br>
Whose corage when the feend perceiv'd to shrinke, <br>
She poured forth out of her hellish <mark5>sinke</mark5><br>
Her fruitfull cursed spawne of serpents <mark4>small,</mark4><br>
Deformed monsters, fowle, and blacke as inke, <br>
Which swarming all about his legs did <mark3>crall,</mark3><br>
And him encombred sore, but could not hurt at <mark1>all.</mark1><br>
As gentle Shepheard in sweete <mark4>even-tide,</mark4><br>
When ruddy Phoebus gins to welke in <mark4>west,</mark4><br>
<br>
High on an hill, his flocke to vewen <mark1>wide,</mark1><br>
Markes which do byte their hasty supper <mark3>best;</mark3><br>
A cloud of combrous gnattes do him <mark3>molest,</mark3><br>
All striving to infixe their feeble <mark4>stings,</mark4><br>
That from their noyance he no where can <mark3>rest,</mark3><br>
But with his clownish hands their tender <mark3>wings</mark3><br>
He brusheth oft, and oft doth mar their murmurings. <br>
Thus ill bestedd, and fearefull more of <mark3>shame,</mark3><br>
Then of the certaine perill he stood <mark4>in,</mark4><br>
Halfe furious unto his foe he <mark1>came,</mark1><br>
<br>
Resolv'd in minde all suddenly to <mark3>win,</mark3><br>
Or soone to lose, before he once would <mark3>lin;</mark3><br>
And strooke at her with more then manly <mark4>force,</mark4><br>
That from her body full of filthie <mark3>sin</mark3><br>
He raft her hatefull head without <mark3>remorse;</mark3><br>
A streame of cole black bloud forth gushed from her <mark3>corse.</mark3><br>
Her scattred brood, soone as their Parent deare <br>
They saw so rudely falling to the <mark1>ground,</mark1><br>
Groning full deadly, all with troublous <mark5>feare,</mark5><br>
Gathred themselves about her body <mark1>round,</mark1><br>
<br>
Weening their wonted entrance to have <mark3>found</mark3><br>
At her wide mouth: but being there <mark4>withstood</mark4><br>
They flocked all about her bleeding <mark1>wound,</mark1><br>
And sucked up their dying mothers <mark4>blood,</mark4><br>
Making her death their life, and eke her hurt their <mark4>good.</mark4><br>
That detestable sight him much <mark5>amazde,</mark5><br>
To see th'unkindly Impes of heaven accurst, <br>
Devoure their dam; on whom while so he gazd, <br>
Having all satisfide their bloudy thurst, <br>
Their bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse <mark4>burst,</mark4><br>
<br>
And bowels gushing forth: well worthy <mark4>end</mark4><br>
Of such as drunke her life, the which them nurst; <br>
Now needeth him no lenger labour <mark3>spend,</mark3><br>
His foes have slaine themselves, with whom he should <mark3>contend.</mark3><br>
His Ladie seeing all, that chaunst, from <mark1>farre</mark1><br>
Approcht in hast to greet his victorie, <br>
And said, Faire knight, borne under happy <mark1>starre,</mark1><br>
Who see your vanquisht foes before you <mark3>lye:</mark3><br>
Well worthy be you of that Armorie, <br>
Wherein ye have great glory wonne this <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
<br>
And proov'd your strength on a strong <mark5>enimie,</mark5><br>
Your first adventure: many such I <mark1>pray,</mark1><br>
And henceforth ever wish, that like succeed it <mark3>may.</mark3><br>
Then mounted he upon his Steede <mark1>againe,</mark1><br>
And with the Lady backward sought to <mark3>wend;</mark3><br>
That path he kept, which beaten was most <mark5>plame,</mark5><br>
Ne ever would to any by-way <mark3>bend,</mark3><br>
But still did follow one unto the <mark1>end,</mark1><br>
The which at last out of the wood them <mark4>brought.</mark4><br>
So forward on his way (with God to <mark5>frend)</mark5><br>
<br>
He passed forth, and new adventure <mark3>sought;</mark3><br>
Long way he travelled, before he heard of <mark3>ought.</mark3><br>
At length they chaunst to meet upon the <mark1>way</mark1><br>
An aged Sire, in long blacke weedes yclad, <br>
His feete all bare, his beard all hoarie <mark3>gray,</mark3><br>
And by his belt his booke he hanging <mark1>had;</mark1><br>
Sober he seemde, and very sagely <mark1>sad,</mark1><br>
And to the ground his eyes were lowly <mark4>bent,</mark4><br>
Simple in shew, and voyde of malice <mark3>bad,</mark3><br>
And all the way he prayed, as he <mark1>went,</mark1><br>
<br>
And often knockt his <mark4>brest</mark4>, as one that did <mark3>repent.</mark3><br>
He faire the knight saluted, louting <mark1>low,</mark1><br>
Who faire him quited, as that courteous <mark1>was:</mark1><br>
And after asked him, if he did <mark3>know</mark3><br>
Of straunge <mark4>adventures</mark4>, which abroad did <mark3>pas.</mark3><br>
Ah my deare Sonne (quoth he) how should, <mark4>alas,</mark4><br>
Silly old man, that lives in hidden <mark4>cell,</mark4><br>
Bidding his beades all day for his <mark5>trespas,</mark5><br>
Tydings of warre and worldly trouble <mark3>tell?</mark3><br>
With holy father sits not with such things to <mark3>mell.</mark3><br>
<br>
But if of daunger which hereby doth <mark3>dwell,</mark3><br>
And homebred evill ye desire to heare, <br>
Of a straunge man I can you tidings <mark1>tell,</mark1><br>
That wasteth all this countrey farre and neare. <br>
Of such (said he) I chiefly do inquere, <br>
And shall you well reward to shew the <mark1>place,</mark1><br>
In which that wicked wight his dayes doth <mark5>weare:</mark5><br>
For to all knighthood it is foule <mark1>disgrace,</mark1><br>
That such a cursed creature lives so long a <mark3>space.</mark3><br>
Far hence (quoth he) in wastfull <mark5>wildernesse</mark5><br>
<br>
His dwelling is, by which no living <mark4>wight</mark4><br>
May ever passe, but thorough great <mark5>distresse.</mark5><br>
Now (sayd the Lady) draweth toward <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
And well I wote, that of your later <mark1>fight</mark1><br>
Ye all forwearied be: for what so <mark3>strong,</mark3><br>
But wanting rest will also want of <mark3>might?</mark3><br>
The Sunne that measures heaven all day <mark1>long,</mark1><br>
At night doth baite his steedes the Ocean waves emong. <br>
Then with the Sunne take Sir, your timely <mark1>rest,</mark1><br>
And with new day new worke at once <mark3>begin:</mark3><br>
<br>
Untroubled night they say gives counsell <mark1>best.</mark1><br>
Right well Sir knight ye have advised <mark3>bin,</mark3><br>
(Quoth then that aged man;) the way to <mark1>win</mark1><br>
Is wisely to advise: now day is <mark4>spent;</mark4><br>
Therefore with me ye may take up your <mark1>In</mark1><br>
For this same <mark4>night</mark4>, The knight was well <mark3>content:</mark3><br>
So with that godly father to his home they <mark1>went.</mark1><br>
A little lowly Hermitage it <mark1>was,</mark1><br>
Downe in a dale, hard by a forests <mark4>side,</mark4><br>
Far from resort of people, that did <mark1>pas</mark1><br>
<br>
In travell to and froe: a little wyde <br>
There was an holy Chappell edifyde, <br>
Wherein the Hermite dewly wont to <mark3>say</mark3><br>
His holy things each morne and <mark5>eventyde:</mark5><br>
Thereby a Christall streame did gently <mark3>play,</mark3><br>
Which from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway. <br>
Arrived there, the little house they <mark4>fill,</mark4><br>
Ne looke for entertainement, where none <mark1>was:</mark1><br>
Rest is their feast, and all things at their <mark1>will;</mark1><br>
The noblest mind the best contentment <mark1>has.</mark1><br>
<br>
With faire discourse the evening so they <mark1>pas:</mark1><br>
For that old man of pleasing wordes had <mark4>store,</mark4><br>
And well could file his tongue as smooth as <mark4>glas;</mark4><br>
He told of Saintes and Popes, and <mark4>evermore</mark4><br>
He strowd an Ave-Mary after and <mark4>before.</mark4><br>
The drouping Night thus creepeth on them <mark1>fast,</mark1><br>
And the sad humour loading their eye liddes, <br>
As messenger of Morpheus on them <mark3>cast</mark3><br>
Sweet slombring deaw, the which to sleepe them biddes. <br>
Unto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes: <br>
<br>
Where when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes, <br>
He to his study goes, and there <mark5>amiddes</mark5><br>
His Magick bookes and artes of sundry <mark5>kindes,</mark5><br>
He seekes out mighty charmes, to trouble sleepy mindes. <br>
Then choosing out few wordes most <mark4>horrible,</mark4><br>
(Let none them read) thereof did verses <mark3>frame,</mark3><br>
With which and other spelles like <mark4>terrible,</mark4><br>
He bad awake blacke Plutoes griesly <mark3>Dame,</mark3><br>
And cursed heaven, and spake reprochfull <mark1>shame</mark1><br>
Of highest God, the Lord of life and <mark1>light;</mark1><br>
<br>
A bold bad man, that dar'd to call by <mark3>name</mark3><br>
Great Gorgon, Prince of darknesse and dead <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
At which Cocytus quakes, and Styx is put to <mark3>flight.</mark3><br>
And forth he cald out of deepe darknesse <mark1>dred</mark1><br>
Legions of Sprights, the which like little <mark5>flyes</mark5><br>
Fluttring about his ever damned <mark1>hed,</mark1><br>
A-waite whereto their service he <mark5>applyes,</mark5><br>
To aide his friends, or fray his <mark5>enimies:</mark5><br>
Of those he chose out two, the falsest twoo, <br>
And fittest for to forge true-seeming <mark5>lyes;</mark5><br>
<br>
The one of them he gave a message <mark3>too,</mark3><br>
The other by him selfe staide other worke to <mark3>doo.</mark3><br>
He making speedy way through spersed <mark4>ayre,</mark4><br>
And through the world of waters wide and <mark1>peepe,</mark1><br>
To Morpheus house doth hastily <mark5>repaire.</mark5><br>
Amid the bowels of the earth full <mark5>steepe,</mark5><br>
And low, where dawning day doth never <mark1>peepe,</mark1><br>
His dwelling is; there Tethys his wet <mark3>bed</mark3><br>
Doth ever wash, and Cynthia still doth <mark1>steepe</mark1><br>
In silver deaw his ever-drouping <mark1>hed,</mark1><br>
<br>
Whiles sad Night over him her mantle black doth <mark5>spred.</mark5><br>
Whose double gates he findeth locked <mark1>fast,</mark1><br>
The one faire fram'd of burnisht Yvory, <br>
The other all with silver <mark1>overcast;</mark1><br>
And wakefull dogges before them farre do <mark1>lye</mark1><br>
Watching to banish Care their <mark5>enimy,</mark5><br>
Who oft is wont to trouble gentle Sleepe. <br>
By them the Sprite doth passe in <mark4>quietly,</mark4><br>
And unto Morpheus comes, whom drowned <mark5>deepe</mark5><br>
In drowsie fit he findes: of nothing he takes keepe. <br>
<br>
And more, to lulle him in his slumber <mark4>soft,</mark4><br>
A trickling streame from high rocke tumbling <mark4>downe</mark4><br>
And ever-drizling raine upon the <mark3>loft,</mark3><br>
Mixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne <br>
Of swarming Bees, did cast him in a swowne: <br>
No other noyse, nor peoples troublous cryes, <br>
As still are wont t'annoy the walled <mark3>towne,</mark3><br>
Might there be heard: but carelesse Quiet <mark1>lyes,</mark1><br>
Wrapt in eternall silence farre from enemyes. <br>
The messenger approching to him <mark4>spake,</mark4><br>
<br>
But his wast wordes returnd to him in <mark1>vaine:</mark1><br>
So sound he slept, that nought mought him <mark3>awake.</mark3><br>
Then rudely he him thrust, and pusht with <mark1>paine,</mark1><br>
Whereat he gan to stretch: but he <mark1>againe</mark1><br>
Shooke him so hard, that forced him to <mark4>speake.</mark4><br>
As one then in a dreame, whose dryer <mark5>braine</mark5><br>
In tost with troubled sights and fancies <mark5>weake,</mark5><br>
He mumbled soft, but would not all his silence <mark5>breake.</mark5><br>
The Sprite then gan more boldly him to <mark4>wake,</mark4><br>
And threatned unto him the dreaded <mark1>name</mark1><br>
<br>
Of Hecate: whereat he gan to <mark3>quake,</mark3><br>
And lifting up his lumpish head, with <mark3>blame</mark3><br>
Halfe angry asked <mark4>him</mark4>, for what he <mark1>came.</mark1><br>
Hither (quoth he) me Archimago <mark4>sent,</mark4><br>
He that the stubborne Sprites can wisely <mark3>tame,</mark3><br>
He bids thee to him send for his <mark3>intent</mark3><br>
A fit false dreame, that can delude the sleepers <mark1>sent.</mark1><br>
The God obayde, and calling forth straight <mark1>way</mark1><br>
A diverse dreame out of his prison <mark4>darke,</mark4><br>
Delivered it to him, and downe did <mark3>lay</mark3><br>
<br>
His heavie head, devoide of carefull carke, <br>
Whose sences all were straight benumbed and <mark3>starke.</mark3><br>
He backe returning by the Yvorie <mark4>dore,</mark4><br>
Remounted up as light as chearefull <mark3>Larke,</mark3><br>
And on his litle winges the dreame he <mark1>bore</mark1><br>
In hast unto his Lord, where he him left afore. <br>
Who all this while with charmes and hidden <mark4>artes,</mark4><br>
Had made a Lady of that other <mark1>Spright,</mark1><br>
And fram'd of liquid ayre her tender partes <br>
So lively, and so like in all mens <mark4>sight,</mark4><br>
<br>
That weaker sence it could have ravisht <mark5>quight:</mark5><br>
The maker selfe for all his wondrous <mark4>witt,</mark4><br>
Was nigh beguiled with so goodly <mark1>sight:</mark1><br>
Her all in white he clad, and over <mark4>it</mark4><br>
Cast a blacke stole, most like to seeme for Una <mark3>fit.</mark3><br>
Now when that ydle dreame was to him <mark1>brought,</mark1><br>
Unto that Elfin knight he bad him <mark3>fly,</mark3><br>
Where he slept soundly void of evill <mark3>thought</mark3><br>
And with false shewes abuse his <mark4>fantasy,</mark4><br>
In sort as he him schooled <mark5>privily:</mark5><br>
<br>
And that new creature borne without her <mark2>dew,</mark2><br>
Full of the makers guile, with usage <mark3>sly</mark3><br>
He taught to imitate that Lady <mark3>trew,</mark3><br>
Whose semblance she did carrie under feigned <mark3>hew.</mark3><br>
Thus well instructed, to their worke they <mark4>hast,</mark4><br>
And comming where the knight in slomber <mark1>lay,</mark1><br>
The one upon his hardy head him <mark5>plast,</mark5><br>
And made him dreame of loves and lustfull <mark1>play,</mark1><br>
That nigh his manly hart did melt <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
Bathed in wanton blis and wicked <mark3>joy:</mark3><br>
<br>
Then seemed him his Lady by him <mark1>lay,</mark1><br>
And to him playnd, how that false winged <mark3>boy,</mark3><br>
Her chast hart had subdewd, to learne Dame pleasures <mark3>toy.</mark3><br>
And she her selfe of beautie soveraigne Queene, <br>
Faire Venus seemde unto his bed to <mark4>bring</mark4><br>
Her, whom he waking evermore did <mark1>weene,</mark1><br>
To be the chastest flowre, that ay did <mark3>spring</mark3><br>
On earthly braunch, the daughter of a <mark3>king,</mark3><br>
Now a loose Leman to vile service <mark4>bound:</mark4><br>
And eke the Graces seemed all to <mark3>sing,</mark3><br>
<br>
Hymen {i}{_o} <mark4>Hymen</mark4>, dauncing all <mark3>around,</mark3><br>
While freshest Flora her with Yvie girlond crownd. <br>
In this great passion of unwonted <mark4>lust,</mark4><br>
Or wonted feare of doing ought <mark4>amis,</mark4><br>
He started up, as seeming to <mark3>mistrust</mark3><br>
Some secret ill, or hidden foe of <mark4>his:</mark4><br>
Lo there before his face his Lady <mark3>is,</mark3><br>
Under blake stole hyding her bayted <mark4>hooke,</mark4><br>
And as halfe blushing offred him to <mark4>kis,</mark4><br>
With gentle blandishment and lovely looke, <br>
<br>
Most like that virgin true, which for her knight him <mark3>took.</mark3><br>
All cleane dismayd to see so uncouth <mark1>sight,</mark1><br>
And halfe enraged at her shamelesse <mark4>guise,</mark4><br>
He thought have slaine her in his fierce <mark5>despight:</mark5><br>
But hasty heat tempring with sufferance <mark3>wise,</mark3><br>
He stayde his hand, and gan himselfe <mark3>advise</mark3><br>
To prove his sense, and tempt her faigned <mark3>truth.</mark3><br>
Wringing her hands in wemens pitteous <mark1>wise,</mark1><br>
Tho can she weepe, to stirre up gentle <mark3>ruth,</mark3><br>
Both for her noble bloud, and for her tender <mark3>youth.</mark3><br>
<br>
And said, Ah Sir, my liege Lord and my <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
Shall I accuse the hidden cruell <mark4>fate,</mark4><br>
And mightie causes wrought in heaven <mark3>above,</mark3><br>
Or the blind God, that doth me thus <mark5>amate,</mark5><br>
For hoped love to winne me certaine <mark1>hate?</mark1><br>
Yet thus perforce he bids me do, or <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
Die is my dew: yet rew my wretched <mark3>state</mark3><br>
You, whom my hard avenging <mark5>destinie</mark5><br>
Hath made judge of my life or death indifferently. <br>
Your owne deare sake forst me at first to <mark4>leave</mark4><br>
<br>
My Fathers kingdome, There she stopt with <mark1>teares;</mark1><br>
Her swollen hart her speach seemd to <mark3>bereave,</mark3><br>
And then againe begun, My weaker yeares <br>
Captiv'd to fortune and frayle worldly <mark5>feares,</mark5><br>
Fly to your faith for succour and sure <mark1>ayde:</mark1><br>
Let me not dye in languor and long <mark1>teares.</mark1><br>
Why Dame (quoth he) what hath ye thus <mark5>dismayd?</mark5><br>
What frayes ye, that were wont to comfort me affrayd? <br>
Love of your selfe, she said, and deare <mark1>constraint</mark1><br>
Lets me not sleepe, but wast the wearie <mark1>night</mark1><br>
<br>
In secret anguish and unpittied <mark5>plaint,</mark5><br>
Whiles you in carelesse sleepe are drowned <mark1>quight.</mark1><br>
Her doubtfull words made that redoubted <mark1>knight</mark1><br>
Suspect her truth: yet since no'untruth he <mark3>knew,</mark3><br>
Her fawning love with foule disdainefull <mark3>spight</mark3><br>
He would not shend, but said, Deare dame I <mark3>rew,</mark3><br>
That for my sake unknowne such griefe unto you <mark3>grew.</mark3><br>
Assure your selfe, it fell not all to <mark1>ground;</mark1><br>
For all so deare as life is to my <mark1>hart,</mark1><br>
I deeme your love, and hold me to you <mark1>bound;</mark1><br>
<br>
Ne let vaine feares procure your needlesse <mark3>smart,</mark3><br>
Where cause is none, but to your rest <mark3>depart.</mark3><br>
Not all content, yet seemd she to <mark4>appease</mark4><br>
Her mournefull plaintes, beguiled of her <mark3>art,</mark3><br>
And fed with <mark4>words</mark4>, that could not chuse but <mark3>please,</mark3><br>
So slyding softly forth, she turnd as to her <mark3>ease.</mark3><br>
Long after lay he musing at her <mark4>mood,</mark4><br>
Much griev'd to think that gentle Dame so <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
For whose defence he was to shed his <mark1>blood.</mark1><br>
At last dull wearinesse of former <mark1>fight</mark1><br>
<br>
Having yrockt a sleepe his irkesome <mark1>spright,</mark1><br>
That troublous dreame gan freshly tosse his <mark1>braine,</mark1><br>
With bowres, and beds, and Ladies deare <mark3>delight:</mark3><br>
But when he saw his labour all was <mark1>vaine,</mark1><br>
With that misformed spright he backe returnd <mark1>againe.</mark1><br>
