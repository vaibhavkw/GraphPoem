Title : On my First Son <br>
Author : Ben Jonson <br><br>

Farewell, thou child of my right hand, and <mark3>joy;</mark3><br>
My sin was too much hope of thee, lov'd <mark3>boy.</mark3><br>
Seven years tho' wert lent to me, and I thee <mark3>pay,</mark3><br>
Exacted by thy fate, on the just <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
O, could I lose all father now! For <mark3>why</mark3><br>
Will man lament the state he should <mark4>envy?</mark4><br>
To have so soon 'scap'd world's and flesh's <mark3>rage,</mark3><br>
And if no other misery, yet <mark3>age?</mark3><br>
Rest in soft peace, and, ask'd, say, "Here doth <mark3>lie</mark3><br>
Ben Jonson his best piece of <mark4>poetry."</mark4><br>
For whose sake henceforth all his vows be <mark3>such,</mark3><br>
As what he loves may never like too <mark3>much.</mark3><br>
