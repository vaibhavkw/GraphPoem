Here Follows Some Verses Upon the Burning<br>
of Our house, July 10th. 1666. Copied Out <mark3>of</mark3><br>
a Loose <mark4>Paper.</mark4><br>
In silent night when rest I <mark3>took,</mark3><br>
For sorrow near I did not <mark3>look,</mark3><br>
I wakened was with thund'ring noise<br>
And piteous shrieks of dreadful <mark4>voice.</mark4><br>
That fearful sound of "fire" and <mark4>"fire,"</mark4><br>
Let no man know is my <mark3>Desire.</mark3><br>
I, starting up, the light did <mark3>spy,</mark3><br>
And to my God my heart did <mark3>cry</mark3><br>
To straighten me in my <mark4>Distress</mark4><br>
And not to leave me succourless.<br>
Then, coming out, behold a <mark4>space</mark4><br>
The flame consume my dwelling <mark3>place.</mark3><br>
And when I could no longer <mark1>look,</mark1><br>
I blest His name that gave and <mark1>took,</mark1><br>
That laid my goods now in the <mark3>dust.</mark3><br>
Yea, so it was, and so 'twas <mark3>just.</mark3><br>
It was his <mark4>own</mark4>, it was not <mark4>mine,</mark4><br>
Far be it that I should repine;<br>
He might of all justly <mark4>bereft</mark4><br>
But yet sufficient for us <mark3>left.</mark3><br>
When by the ruins oft I <mark4>past</mark4><br>
My sorrowing eyes aside did <mark3>cast</mark3><br>
And here and there the places <mark1>spy</mark1><br>
Where oft I sate and long did <mark3>lie.</mark3><br>
Here stood that trunk, and there that <mark4>chest,</mark4><br>
There lay that store I counted <mark3>best.</mark3><br>
My pleasant things in ashes <mark1>lie</mark1><br>
And them behold no more shall <mark3>I.</mark3><br>
Under thy roof no guest shall <mark4>sit,</mark4><br>
Nor at thy Table eat a <mark3>bit.</mark3><br>
No pleasant talk shall 'ere be <mark3>told</mark3><br>
Nor things recounted done of <mark3>old.</mark3><br>
No Candle e'er shall shine in <mark3>Thee,</mark3><br>
Nor bridegroom's voice e'er heard shall <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
In silence ever shalt thou <mark1>lie,</mark1><br>
Adieu, Adieu, all's <mark4>vanity.</mark4><br>
Then straight I 'gin my heart to <mark4>chide,</mark4><br>
And did thy wealth on earth <mark3>abide?</mark3><br>
Didst fix thy hope on mould'ring <mark1>dust?</mark1><br>
The arm of flesh didst make thy <mark3>trust?</mark3><br>
Raise up thy thoughts above the <mark3>sky</mark3><br>
That dunghill mists away may <mark3>fly.</mark3><br>
Thou hast a house on high <mark4>erect</mark4><br>
Frameed by that mighty <mark4>Architect,</mark4><br>
With glory richly <mark4>furnished,</mark4><br>
Stands permanent though this be <mark4>fled.</mark4><br>
It's purchased and paid for <mark5>too</mark5><br>
By Him who hath enough to <mark3>do.</mark3><br>
A price so vast as is <mark4>unknown,</mark4><br>
Yet by His gift is made thine <mark3>own;</mark3><br>
There's wealth enough, I need no <mark4>more,</mark4><br>
Farewell, my pelf, farewell, my <mark3>store.</mark3><br>
The world no longer let me <mark3>love,</mark3><br>
My hope and treasure lies <mark3>above.</mark3><br>
