Title : Makeup on Empty Space <br>
Author : Anne Waldman <br><br>

I am putting makeup on empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
all patinas convening on empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
rouge blushing on empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
I am putting makeup on empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
pasting eyelashes on empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
painting the eyebrows of empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
piling creams on empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
painting the phenomenal <mark1>world</mark1><br>
I am hanging ornaments on empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
gold clips, lacquer combs, plastic hairpins on empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
I am sticking wire pins into empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
I pour words over empty <mark1>space</mark1>, enthrall the empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
packing, stuffing jamming empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
spinning necklaces around empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
Fancy this, imagine this: painting the phenomenal <mark1>world</mark1><br>
bangles on <mark4>wrists</mark4><br>
pendants hung on empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
I am putting my memory into empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
undressing <mark1>you</mark1><br>
hanging the wrinkled clothes on a <mark1>nail</mark1><br>
hanging the green coat on a <mark1>nail</mark1><br>
dancing in the evening it ended with dancing in the <mark4>evening</mark4><br>
I am still thinking about putting makeup on empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
I want to scare you: the hanging <mark1>night</mark1>, the drifting <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
the moaning night, daughter of troubled sleep I want to scare <mark1>you</mark1><br>
<br>
I bind as far as cold day <mark3>goes</mark3><br>
I bind the power of 20 husky <mark4>men</mark4><br>
I bind the seductive colorful women, all of <mark5>them</mark5><br>
I bind the massive <mark4>rock</mark4><br>
I bind the hanging night, the drifting night, <mark5>the</mark5><br>
moaning night, daughter of troubled <mark1>sleep</mark1><br>
I am binding my debts, I magnetize the phone <mark4>bill</mark4><br>
bind the root of my pointed <mark4>tongue</mark4><br>
I cup my hands in water, splash water on empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
water drunk by empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
Look what thoughts will do   Look what words will <mark3>do</mark3><br>
from nothing to the <mark3>face</mark3><br>
from nothing to the root of the <mark1>tongue</mark1><br>
from nothing to speaking of empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
I bind the ash <mark3>tree</mark3><br>
I bind the <mark3>yew</mark3><br>
I bind the willow <br>
I bind <mark4>uranium</mark4><br>
I bind the uneconomical unrenewable energy of <mark1>uranium</mark1><br>
dash uranium to empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
I bind the color red I seduce the color red to empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
I put the sunset in empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
I take the blue of his eyes and make an offering to empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
renewable <mark3>blue</mark3><br>
I take the green of everything coming to life, it grows <mark3>&</mark3><br>
climbs into empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
I put the white of the snow at the foot of empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
I clasp the yellow of the cat's eyes sitting in <mark1>the</mark1><br>
black space I clasp them to my heart, empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
I want the brown of this floor to rise up into empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
Take the floor apart to find the <mark4>brown,</mark4><br>
bind it up again under spell of empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
I want to take this old wall apart I am rich in my mind <mark4>thinking</mark4><br>
of <mark4>this</mark4>, I am thinking of putting makeup on empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
Everything crumbles around empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
the thin dry weed crumbles, the milkweed is blown into empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
I bind the stars reflected in your eye <br>
from nothing to these typing <mark4>fingers</mark4><br>
from nothing to the legs of the <mark4>elk</mark4><br>
from nothing to the neck of the <mark3>deer</mark3><br>
from nothing to porcelain teeth <br>
from nothing to the fine stand of pine in the <mark4>forest</mark4><br>
I kept it going when I put the water <mark4>on</mark4><br>
when I let the water <mark4>run</mark4><br>
sweeping together in empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
There is a better way to say empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
Turn yourself inside out and you might <mark3>disappear</mark3><br>
you have a new definition in empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
What I like about impermanence is the clash   <br>
of my big body with empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
I am putting the floor back together <mark4>again</mark4><br>
I am rebuilding the <mark4>wall</mark4><br>
I am slapping mortar on <mark4>bricks</mark4><br>
I am fastening the machine together with delicate <mark4>wire</mark4><br>
There is no eternal <mark4>thread</mark4>, maybe there is thread of pure <mark4>gold</mark4><br>
I am starting to sing inside about the empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
there is some new detail every <mark4>time</mark4><br>
I am taping the picture I love so well on the <mark1>wall:</mark1><br>
moonless black night beyond country-plaid <mark4>curtains</mark4><br>
everything illuminated out of empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
I hang the black linen dress on my <mark4>body</mark4><br>
the hanging <mark1>night</mark1>, the drifting night, the moaning <mark1>night</mark1><br>
daughter of troubled <mark1>sleep</mark1><br>
This occurs to <mark3>me</mark3><br>
I hang up a mirror to catch stars, everything occurs to me out in <mark1>the</mark1><br>
night in my skull of empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
I go outside in starry <mark4>ice</mark4><br>
I build up the house again in memory of empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
This occurs to me about empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
that it is nevered to be mentioned <mark1>again</mark1><br>
Fancy <mark4>this</mark4><br>
imagine <mark1>this</mark1><br>
painting the phenomenal <mark1>world</mark1><br>
there's talk of dressing the body with strange adornments <br>
to remind you of a vow to empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
there's talk of the discourse in your mind like a <mark4>silkworm</mark4><br>
I wish to venture into a not-chiseled <mark3>place</mark3><br>
I pour sand on the <mark4>ground</mark4><br>
Objects and vehicles emerge from the fog <br>
the canyon is dangerous <mark3>tonight</mark3><br>
suddenly there are warning <mark4>lights</mark4><br>
The patrol is helpful in the manner of <mark4>guiding</mark4><br>
there is talk of slowing <mark4>down</mark4><br>
there is talk of a feminine <mark4>deity</mark4><br>
I bind her with a <mark3>briar</mark3><br>
I bind with the tooth of a <mark4>tiger</mark4><br>
I bind with my quartz <mark4>crystal</mark4><br>
I magnetize the <mark4>worlds</mark4><br>
I cover myself with <mark4>jewels</mark4><br>
I drink amrita <br>
there is some new <mark4>detail</mark4><br>
there is a spangle on her <mark3>shoe</mark3><br>
there is a stud on her <mark4>boot</mark4><br>
the tires are studded for the difficult <mark4>climb</mark4><br>
I put my hands to my <mark1>face</mark1><br>
I am putting makeup on empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
I wanted to scare you with the night that scared <mark1>me</mark1><br>
the drifting <mark1>night</mark1>, the moaning <mark1>night</mark1><br>
Someone was always intruding to make you forget empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
you put it all <mark1>on</mark1><br>
you paint your <mark4>nails</mark4><br>
you put on <mark4>scarves</mark4><br>
all the time adorning empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
Whatever-your-name-is I tell you "empty <mark1>space"</mark1><br>
with your fictions with dancing come around to <mark4>it</mark4><br>
with your funny way of singing come around to <mark1>it</mark1><br>
with your smiling come to <mark1>it</mark1><br>
with your enormous retinue & accumulation come around to <mark1>it</mark1><br>
with your extras come round to <mark1>it</mark1><br>
with your good fortune, with your lazy fortune come round to <mark1>it</mark1><br>
when you look most like a bird, that is the time to come around to <mark1>it</mark1><br>
when you are cheating, come to <mark1>it</mark1><br>
when you are in your anguished <mark4>head</mark4><br>
when you are not <mark4>sensible</mark4><br>
when you are insisting on <mark1>the</mark1><br>
praise from many <mark4>tongues</mark4><br>
It begins with the root of the <mark1>tongue</mark1><br>
it begins with the root of the <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
there is a spinal cord of <mark4>wind</mark4><br>
singing & moaning in empty <mark1>space</mark1><br>
