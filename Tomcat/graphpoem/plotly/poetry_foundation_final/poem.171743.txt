Title : Way-Station <br>
Author : Archibald MacLeish <br><br>

The incoherent rushing of the <mark3>train</mark3><br>
Dulls like a drugged <mark3>pain</mark3><br>
<br>
To an ether throbbing of inaudible <mark4>drums</mark4><br>
Hush within hush until the night <mark4>withholds</mark4><br>
<br>
Only its darkness. <br>
From the <mark3>deep</mark3><br>
<br>
Dark a voice calls like a voice in <mark3>sleep</mark3><br>
Slowly a strange name in a strange tongue.   <br>
The sleeping listeners a <mark3>sound</mark3><br>
<br>
As leaves stir faintly on the <mark3>ground</mark3><br>
<br>
When snow falls from a windless <mark3>sky--</mark3><br>
<br>
A stir    A <mark3>sigh</mark3><br>
