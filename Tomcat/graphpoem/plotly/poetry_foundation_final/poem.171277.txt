Title : All My Pretty Ones <br>
Author : Anne Sexton <br><br>

Father, this year's jinx rides us <mark3>apart</mark3><br>
where you followed our mother to her cold <mark4>slumber;</mark4><br>
a second shock boiling its stone to your <mark3>heart,</mark3><br>
leaving me here to shuffle and disencumber   <br>
you from the residence you could not <mark3>afford:</mark3><br>
a gold key, your half of a woolen <mark3>mill,</mark3><br>
twenty suits from Dunne's, an English <mark3>Ford,</mark3><br>
the love and legal verbiage of another <mark3>will,</mark3><br>
boxes of pictures of people I do not <mark3>know.</mark3><br>
I touch their cardboard faces. They must <mark3>go.</mark3><br>
<br>
But the eyes, as thick as wood in this <mark4>album,</mark4><br>
hold me. I stop here, where a small <mark3>boy</mark3><br>
waits in a ruffled dress for someone to come <mark4>...</mark4><br>
for this soldier who holds his bugle like a <mark3>toy</mark3><br>
or for this velvet lady who cannot <mark4>smile.</mark4><br>
Is this your father's father, this <mark5>commodore</mark5><br>
in a mailman suit? My father, time <mark4>meanwhile</mark4><br>
has made it unimportant who you are looking <mark4>for.</mark4><br>
I'll never know what these faces are all <mark4>about.</mark4><br>
I lock them into their book and throw them <mark3>out.</mark3><br>
<br>
This is the yellow scrapbook that you <mark3>began</mark3><br>
the year I was born; as crackling now and wrinkly   <br>
as tobacco leaves: clippings where Hoover <mark3>outran</mark3><br>
the Democrats, wiggling his dry finger at me <br>
and Prohibition; news where the Hindenburg <mark4>went</mark4><br>
down and recent years where you went <mark3>flush</mark3><br>
on war. This year, solvent but sick, you <mark3>meant</mark3><br>
to marry that pretty widow in a one-month <mark3>rush.</mark3><br>
But before you had that second chance, I <mark4>cried</mark4><br>
on your fat shoulder. Three days later you <mark3>died.</mark3><br>
<br>
These are the snapshots of marriage, stopped in <mark3>places.</mark3><br>
Side by side at the rail toward Nassau <mark3>now;</mark3><br>
here, with the winner's cup at the speedboat <mark3>races,</mark3><br>
here, in tails at the Cotillion, you take a <mark3>bow,</mark3><br>
here, by our kennel of dogs with their pink <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
running like show-bred pigs in their chain-link <mark4>pen;</mark4><br>
here, at the horseshow where my sister wins a <mark3>prize;</mark3><br>
and here, standing like a duke among groups of <mark3>men.</mark3><br>
Now I fold you down, my drunkard, my <mark4>navigator,</mark4><br>
my first lost <mark4>keeper</mark4>, to love or look at <mark4>later.</mark4><br>
<br>
I hold a five-year diary that my mother <mark4>kept</mark4><br>
for three years, telling all she does not <mark3>say</mark3><br>
of your alcoholic tendency. You <mark3>overslept,</mark3><br>
she writes. My God, father, each Christmas <mark3>Day</mark3><br>
with your blood, will I drink down your <mark3>glass</mark3><br>
of wine? The diary of your hurly-burly <mark4>years</mark4><br>
goes to my shelf to wait for my age to <mark3>pass.</mark3><br>
Only in this hoarded span will love <mark4>persevere.</mark4><br>
Whether you are pretty or not, I outlive <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
bend down my strange face to yours and forgive <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
