Title : Bewitched Playground <br>
Author : David Rivard <br><br>

Each could picture probably <br>
with great care his brother drawing   <br>
the corded string of a watered silk bag <br>
and mumbling to Basho above the <mark4>keepsake</mark4><br>
pay your respects to mother's white <mark1>hair</mark1><br>
now your eyebrows look a little white too <br>
but all have turned instead to watch this <mark4>child</mark4><br>
a girl my daughter Simone <br>
an astute migrant <br>
skimming the stream of <mark4>days</mark4><br>
toted wherever she wants <br>
to eat the dirt of inattentive <mark4>towns</mark4><br>
to arm wrestle as with <br>
the blind & steal a <mark4>stoic</mark4><br>
shipping him home-- <br>
all have turned & run to her <mark4>because</mark4><br>
she has a spider on her neck she <mark4>has</mark4><br>
seen herself <br>
though blindfolded by a <mark4>cloud</mark4><br>
the sun is a yellowjacket <br>
drowning in a cup of coffee she <mark4>carries</mark4><br>
a spider in her <mark1>hair</mark1><br>
blond & blonder dear river. <br>
