Title : Milton <br>
Author : Henry Wadsworth Longfellow <br><br>

I pace the sounding sea-beach and <mark3>behold</mark3><br>
How the voluminous billows roll and <mark3>run,</mark3><br>
Upheaving and subsiding, while the <mark3>sun</mark3><br>
Shines through their sheeted emerald far <mark3>unrolled,</mark3><br>
And the ninth wave, slow gathering fold by <mark3>fold</mark3><br>
All its loose-flowing garments into <mark3>one,</mark3><br>
Plunges upon the shore, and floods the <mark3>dun</mark3><br>
Pale reach of sands, and changes them to <mark3>gold.</mark3><br>
So in majestic cadence rise and <mark3>fall</mark3><br>
The mighty undulations of thy <mark3>song,</mark3><br>
      O sightless bard, England's Maeonides! <br>
And ever and anon, high over <mark3>all</mark3><br>
Uplifted, a ninth wave superb and <mark3>strong,</mark3><br>
      Floods all the soul with its melodious seas. <br>
