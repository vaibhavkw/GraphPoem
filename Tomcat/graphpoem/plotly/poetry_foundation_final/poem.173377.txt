Title : Lovers' Infiniteness <br>
Author : John Donne <br><br>

If yet I have not all thy <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
Dear, I shall never have it <mark3>all;</mark3><br>
I cannot breathe one other sigh, to <mark4>move,</mark4><br>
Nor can intreat one other tear to <mark3>fall;</mark3><br>
And all my treasure, which should purchase <mark3>thee--</mark3><br>
Sighs, tears, and oaths, and letters--I have <mark3>spent.</mark3><br>
Yet no more can be due to <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
Than at the bargain made was <mark3>meant;</mark3><br>
If then thy gift of love were <mark4>partial,</mark4><br>
That some to me, some should to others <mark1>fall,</mark1><br>
Dear, I shall never have thee <mark1>all.</mark1><br>
<br>
Or if then thou gavest me <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
All was but all, which thou hadst <mark5>then;</mark5><br>
But if in thy heart, since, there be or <mark4>shall</mark4><br>
New love created be, by other <mark3>men,</mark3><br>
Which have their stocks entire, and can in <mark3>tears,</mark3><br>
In sighs, in oaths, and letters, outbid <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
This new love may beget new <mark3>fears,</mark3><br>
For this love was not vow'd by <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
And yet it was, thy gift being <mark4>general;</mark4><br>
The ground, thy heart, is mine; whatever <mark1>shall</mark1><br>
Grow there, dear, I should have it <mark1>all.</mark1><br>
<br>
Yet I would not have all <mark4>yet,</mark4><br>
He that hath all can have no <mark3>more;</mark3><br>
And since my love doth every day <mark4>admit</mark4><br>
New growth, thou shouldst have new rewards in <mark3>store;</mark3><br>
Thou canst not every day give me thy <mark4>heart,</mark4><br>
If thou canst give <mark1>it</mark1>, then thou never gavest <mark4>it;</mark4><br>
Love's riddles are, that though thy heart <mark4>depart,</mark4><br>
It stays at home, and thou with losing savest <mark1>it;</mark1><br>
But we will have a way more <mark4>liberal,</mark4><br>
Than changing hearts, to join them; so we <mark1>shall</mark1><br>
Be one, and one another's <mark1>all.</mark1><br>
