Title : Sometime During Eternity . . . <br>
Author : Lawrence Ferlinghetti <br><br>

Sometime during eternity <br>
some guys show <mark4>up</mark4><br>
and one of <mark1>them</mark1><br>
who shows up real <mark4>late</mark4><br>
is a kind of <mark4>carpenter</mark4><br>
from some square-type <mark4>place</mark4><br>
                                              like Galilee <br>
          and he starts wailing <br>
and claiming he is <mark4>hip</mark4><br>
to who made <mark4>heaven</mark4><br>
                                       and earth <br>
and that the <mark4>cat</mark4><br>
who really laid it on <mark4>us</mark4><br>
is his <mark4>Dad</mark4><br>
<br>
And <mark4>moreover</mark4><br>
he <mark4>adds</mark4><br>
It's all writ <mark4>down</mark4><br>
                                              on some scroll-type parchments   <br>
which some <mark4>henchmen</mark4><br>
leave lying around the Dead Sea <mark4>somewheres</mark4><br>
a long time <mark3>ago</mark3><br>
and which you won't even <mark4>find</mark4><br>
for a coupla thousand years or <mark3>so</mark3><br>
or at least <mark4>for</mark4><br>
nineteen hundred and <mark5>fortyseven</mark5><br>
of <mark1>them</mark1><br>
to be <mark4>exact</mark4><br>
and even <mark4>then</mark4><br>
nobody really believes <mark1>them</mark1><br>
or <mark3>me</mark3><br>
for that <mark4>matter</mark4><br>
You're <mark4>hot</mark4><br>
they tell <mark4>him</mark4><br>
And they cool <mark1>him</mark1><br>
<br>
They stretch him on the Tree to <mark1>cool</mark1><br>
<br>
And everybody after <mark4>that</mark4><br>
is always making <mark4>models</mark4><br>
of this <mark3>Tree</mark3><br>
with Him hung <mark1>up</mark1><br>
and always crooning His <mark4>name</mark4><br>
and calling Him to come <mark1>down</mark1><br>
and sit <mark4>in</mark4><br>
                                                 on their combo <br>
as if he is the king <mark1>cat</mark1><br>
who's got to <mark3>blow</mark3><br>
or they can't quite make <mark4>it</mark4><br>
<br>
Only he don't come <mark1>down</mark1><br>
from His <mark1>Tree</mark1><br>
Him just hang <mark4>there</mark4><br>
on His <mark1>Tree</mark1><br>
looking real Petered <mark4>out</mark4><br>
and real <mark1>cool</mark1><br>
                                                             and also <br>
according to a <mark4>roundup</mark4><br>
of late world <mark4>news</mark4><br>
from the usual unreliable <mark4>sources</mark4><br>
real <mark4>dead</mark4><br>
