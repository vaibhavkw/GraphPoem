Author : Marjorie Pickthall <br><br>

I shall not go with <mark3>pain</mark3><br>
Whether you hold me, whether you <mark4>forget</mark4><br>
My little loss and my immortal <mark3>gain.</mark3><br>
O flower unseen, O fountain sealed <mark4>apart!</mark4><br>
Give me one look, one look remembering <mark4>yet,</mark4><br>
Sweet <mark4>heart.</mark4><br>
<br>
I shall not go with <mark3>grief,</mark3><br>
Whether you call me, whether you <mark3>deny</mark3><br>
The crowning vintage and the golden <mark3>sheaf.</mark3><br>
O, April hopes that blossom but to <mark3>close!</mark3><br>
Give me one look, one look and so <mark3>good-bye,</mark3><br>
Red <mark3>rose.</mark3><br>
<br>
I shall not go with <mark4>sighs,</mark4><br>
But as full-crowned the warrior leaves the <mark4>fight,</mark4><br>
Dawn on his shield and death upon his <mark3>eyes.</mark3><br>
O, life so bitter-sweet and heaven so <mark3>far!</mark3><br>
Give me one look, one look and so good <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
My <mark3>star.</mark3><br>
