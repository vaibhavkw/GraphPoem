Title : Lines Written in Kensington Gardens <br>
Author : Matthew Arnold <br><br>

In this lone, open glade I <mark3>lie,</mark3><br>
Screen'd by deep boughs on either <mark3>hand;</mark3><br>
And at its end, to stay the <mark3>eye,</mark3><br>
Those black-crown'd, red-boled pine-trees <mark3>stand!</mark3><br>
<br>
Birds here make song, each bird has <mark3>his,</mark3><br>
Across the girdling city's <mark3>hum.</mark3><br>
How green under the boughs it <mark3>is!</mark3><br>
How thick the tremulous sheep-cries <mark3>come!</mark3><br>
<br>
Sometimes a child will cross the <mark4>glade</mark4><br>
To take his nurse his broken <mark3>toy;</mark3><br>
Sometimes a thrush flit <mark4>overhead</mark4><br>
Deep in her unknown day's <mark3>employ.</mark3><br>
<br>
Here at my feet what wonders <mark3>pass,</mark3><br>
What endless, active life is <mark4>here!</mark4><br>
What blowing daisies, fragrant <mark3>grass!</mark3><br>
An air-stirr'd forest, fresh and <mark4>clear.</mark4><br>
<br>
Scarce fresher is the <mark4>mountain-sod</mark4><br>
Where the tired angler lies, stretch'd <mark3>out,</mark3><br>
<mark4>And</mark4>, eased of basket and of <mark3>rod,</mark3><br>
Counts his day's spoil, the spotted <mark3>trout.</mark3><br>
<br>
In the huge world, which roars hard <mark3>by,</mark3><br>
Be others happy if they <mark3>can!</mark3><br>
But in my helpless cradle <mark3>I</mark3><br>
Was breathed on by the rural <mark3>Pan.</mark3><br>
<br>
I, on men's impious uproar <mark4>hurl'd,</mark4><br>
Think often, as I hear them <mark3>rave,</mark3><br>
That peace has left the upper <mark4>world</mark4><br>
And now keeps only in the <mark3>grave.</mark3><br>
<br>
Yet here is peace for ever <mark3>new!</mark3><br>
When I who watch them am <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
Still all things in this glade go <mark3>through</mark3><br>
The changes of their quiet <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then to their happy rest they <mark1>pass!</mark1><br>
The flowers upclose, the birds are <mark4>fed,</mark4><br>
The night comes down upon the <mark1>grass,</mark1><br>
The child sleeps warmly in his <mark3>bed.</mark3><br>
<br>
Calm soul of all things! make it <mark4>mine</mark4><br>
To feel, amid the city's <mark4>jar,</mark4><br>
That there abides a peace of <mark3>thine,</mark3><br>
Man did not make, and cannot <mark3>mar.</mark3><br>
<br>
The will to neither strive nor <mark3>cry,</mark3><br>
The power to feel with others <mark4>give!</mark4><br>
Calm, calm me more! nor let me <mark3>die</mark3><br>
Before I have begun to <mark3>live.</mark3><br>
