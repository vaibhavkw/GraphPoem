More nice than <mark4>wise.</mark4><br>
XI Mon. January [1733] hath xxxi <mark4>days.</mark4><br>
<br>
Old Batchelor would have a Wife that's <mark1>wise,</mark1><br>
Fair, rich, and young, a Maiden for his <mark3>Bed;</mark3><br>
Not proud, nor churlish, but of faultless <mark3>size;</mark3><br>
A Country Houswife in the City <mark3>bred.</mark3><br>
He's a nice Fool, and long in vain hath <mark4>staid;</mark4><br>
He should bespeak her, there's none ready <mark3>made.</mark3><br>
<br>
XII Mon. February hath xxviii <mark1>days.</mark1><br>
<br>
            N. N. of B---s County, pray don't be angry with <br>
poor <mark4>Richard.</mark4><br>
<br>
Each Age of Men new Fashions doth <mark3>invent;</mark3><br>
Things which are old, young Men do not <mark3>esteem:</mark3><br>
What pleas'd our Fathers, doth not us <mark3>content;</mark3><br>
What flourish'd then, we out of fashion <mark3>deem:</mark3><br>
And that's the reason, as I <mark4>understand,</mark4><br>
Why Prodigus did fell his Father's <mark3>Land.</mark3><br>
<br>
I Mon. March hath xxxi <mark1>days.</mark1><br>
<br>
My Love and I for Kisses <mark3>play'd,</mark3><br>
She would keep stakes, I was <mark1>content,</mark1><br>
But when I won she would be <mark4>paid;</mark4><br>
This made me ask her what she <mark3>meant:</mark3><br>
Quoth she, since you are in this wrangling <mark3>vein,</mark3><br>
Here take your Kisses, give me mine <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
<br>
II Mon. April hath xxx <mark1>days.</mark1><br>
<br>
Kind Katharine to her husband kiss'd these <mark4>words,</mark4><br>
" Mine own sweet Will, how dearly I love <mark3>thee!</mark3><br>
If true (quoth Will) the World no such <mark4>affords.</mark4><br>
And that its true I durst his warrant <mark3>be;</mark3><br>
For ne'er heard I of Woman good or <mark3>ill,</mark3><br>
But always loved best, her own sweet <mark3>Will.</mark3><br>
<br>
III Mon. May hath xxxi <mark1>days.</mark1><br>
<br>
Mirth pleaseth some, to others 'tis offence, <br>
Some commend plain conceit, some profound sense; <br>
Some wish a witty <mark4>Jest</mark4>, some dislike <mark4>that,</mark4><br>
And most would have themselves they know not <mark4>what.</mark4><br>
Then he that would please all, and himself <mark3>too,</mark3><br>
Takes more in hand than he is like to <mark3>do.</mark3><br>
<br>
IV Mon. June hath xxx <mark1>days.</mark1><br>
<br>
Observe the daily circle of the <mark4>sun,</mark4><br>
And the short year of each revolving <mark4>moon:</mark4><br>
By them thou shalt foresee the following <mark5>day,</mark5><br>
Nor shall a starry night thy hopes <mark3>betray.</mark3><br>
When first the moon <mark4>appears</mark4>, if then she <mark4>shrouds</mark4><br>
Her silver crescent, tip'd with sable <mark3>clouds,</mark3><br>
Conclude she bodes a tempest on the <mark4>main,</mark4><br>
And brews for fields impetuous floods of <mark3>rain.</mark3><br>
<br>
V Mon. July hath xxxi <mark1>days.</mark1><br>
<br>
Ev'n while the reaper fills his greedy <mark4>hands,</mark4><br>
And binds the golden sheafs in brittle <mark3>bands:</mark3><br>
Oft have I seen a sudden storm <mark4>arise</mark4><br>
From all the warring winds that sweep the <mark3>skies:</mark3><br>
And oft whole sheets descend of slucy <mark1>rain,</mark1><br>
Suck'd by the spungy clouds from oft the <mark1>main;</mark1><br>
The lofty skies at once come pouring <mark4>down,</mark4><br>
The promis'd crop and golden labours <mark3>drown.</mark3><br>
<br>
VI Mon. August hath xxxi <mark1>days.</mark1><br>
<br>
For us thro' 12 bright signs Apollo <mark4>guides</mark4><br>
The year, and earth in sev'ral climes <mark3>divides.</mark3><br>
Five girdles bind the skies, the torrid <mark4>zone</mark4><br>
Glows with the passing and repassing <mark1>sun.</mark1><br>
Far on the right and left, th'extreams of <mark5>heav'n,</mark5><br>
To frosts and snows and bitter blasts are giv'n. <br>
Betwixt the midst and <mark4>these</mark4>, the Gods <mark4>assign'd</mark4><br>
Two habitable seats for humane <mark4>kind.</mark4><br>
<br>
VII Mon. September hath xxx <mark1>days.</mark1><br>
<br>
Death is a Fisherman, the world we <mark3>see</mark3><br>
His Fish-pond is, and we the Fishes <mark1>be:</mark1><br>
His Net some general Sickness; howe'er <mark3>he</mark3><br>
Is not so kind as other Fishers <mark1>be;</mark1><br>
For if they take one of the smaller <mark3>Fry,</mark3><br>
They throw him in again, he shall not <mark3>die:</mark3><br>
But Death is sure to kill all he can <mark4>get,</mark4><br>
And all is Fish with him that comes to <mark3>Net.</mark3><br>
<br>
VIII Mon. October hath xxxi <mark1>days.</mark1><br>
<br>
Time was my spouse and I could not <mark3>agree,</mark3><br>
Striving about <mark4>superiority:</mark4><br>
The text which saith that man and wife are <mark3>one,</mark3><br>
Was the chief argument we stood <mark4>upon:</mark4><br>
She held, they both one woman should <mark4>become;</mark4><br>
I held they should be <mark4>man</mark4>, and both but <mark1>one.</mark1><br>
Thus we contended daily, but the <mark3>strife</mark3><br>
Could not be ended, till both were one <mark3>Wife.</mark3><br>
<br>
IX Mon. November hath xxx <mark1>days.</mark1><br>
<br>
My neighbour H---y by his pleasing <mark3>tongue,</mark3><br>
Hath won a Girl that's rich, wise, fair and <mark3>young,</mark3><br>
The Match (he saith) is half concluded, <mark1>he</mark1><br>
Indeed is wondrous willing; but not <mark3>she.</mark3><br>
And reason good, for he has run thro'all <br>
Almost the story of the <mark4>Prodigal;</mark4><br>
Yet swears he never with the hogs did <mark4>dine;</mark4><br>
That's true, for none would trust him with their <mark3>swine.</mark3><br>
<br>
X Mon. December hath xxxi <mark1>days.</mark1><br>
<br>
She that will eat her breakfast in her <mark1>bed,</mark1><br>
And spend the morn in dressing of her <mark3>head,</mark3><br>
And sit at dinner like a maiden <mark4>bride,</mark4><br>
And talk of nothing all day but of <mark3>pride;</mark3><br>
God in his mercy may do much to save <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
But what a case is he in that shall have <mark1>her.</mark1><br>
