Title : I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud <br>
Author : William Wordsworth <br><br>

I wandered lonely as a <mark3>cloud</mark3><br>
That floats on high o'er vales and <mark4>hills,</mark4><br>
When all at once I saw a <mark3>crowd,</mark3><br>
A host, of golden <mark4>daffodils;</mark4><br>
Beside the lake, beneath the <mark4>trees,</mark4><br>
Fluttering and dancing in the <mark3>breeze.</mark3><br>
<br>
Continuous as the stars that <mark3>shine</mark3><br>
And twinkle on the milky <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
They stretched in never-ending <mark3>line</mark3><br>
Along the margin of a <mark3>bay:</mark3><br>
Ten thousand saw I at a <mark3>glance,</mark3><br>
Tossing their heads in sprightly <mark3>dance.</mark3><br>
<br>
The waves beside them danced; but <mark3>they</mark3><br>
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee: <br>
A poet could not but be <mark3>gay,</mark3><br>
In such a jocund company: <br>
I gazed--and gazed--but little <mark3>thought</mark3><br>
What wealth the show to me had <mark3>brought:</mark3><br>
<br>
For oft, when on my couch I <mark3>lie</mark3><br>
In vacant or in pensive <mark4>mood,</mark4><br>
They flash upon that inward <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
Which is the bliss of <mark4>solitude;</mark4><br>
And then my heart with pleasure <mark4>fills,</mark4><br>
And dances with the <mark1>daffodils.</mark1><br>
