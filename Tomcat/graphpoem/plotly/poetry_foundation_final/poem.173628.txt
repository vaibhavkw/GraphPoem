Title : The Hold-fast <br>
Author : George Herbert <br><br>

<br>
I threaten'd to observe the strict <mark3>decree</mark3><br>
Of my dear God with all my power and <mark3>might;</mark3><br>
But I was told by one it could not <mark3>be;</mark3><br>
Yet I might trust in God to be my <mark3>light.</mark3><br>
"Then will I trust," said I, "in Him <mark3>alone."</mark3><br>
"Nay, e'en to trust in Him was also <mark3>His:</mark3><br>
We must confess that nothing is our <mark3>own."</mark3><br>
"Then I confess that He my succour <mark3>is."</mark3><br>
"But to have nought is ours, not to <mark4>confess</mark4><br>
That we have nought." I stood amaz'd at <mark4>this,</mark4><br>
Much troubled, till I heard a friend <mark4>express</mark4><br>
That all things were more ours by being <mark1>His;</mark1><br>
What Adam had, and forfeited for <mark3>all,</mark3><br>
Christ keepeth now, who cannot fail or <mark3>fall.</mark3><br>
