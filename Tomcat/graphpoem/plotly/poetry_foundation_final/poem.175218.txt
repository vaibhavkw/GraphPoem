Title : Windy Nights <br>
Author : Robert Louis Stevenson <br><br>

Whenever the moon and stars are <mark3>set,</mark3><br>
Whenever the wind is <mark3>high,</mark3><br>
All night long in the dark and <mark3>wet,</mark3><br>
A man goes riding <mark3>by.</mark3><br>
Late in the night when the fires are <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
Why does he gallop and gallop <mark3>about?</mark3><br>
<br>
Whenever the trees are crying <mark3>aloud,</mark3><br>
And ships are tossed at <mark3>sea,</mark3><br>
By, on the highway, low and <mark3>loud,</mark3><br>
By at the gallop goes <mark3>he.</mark3><br>
By at the gallop he goes, and <mark3>then</mark3><br>
By he comes back at the gallop <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
