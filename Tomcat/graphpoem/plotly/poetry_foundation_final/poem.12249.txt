Title : Song ("The world is full of loss ... ")<br>
Author : Muriel Rukeyser<br><br>

The world is full of loss; bring, wind, my love,<br>
my home is where we make our <mark3>meeting-place,</mark3><br>
and love whatever I shall touch and <mark4>read</mark4><br>
within that <mark3>face.</mark3><br>
<br>
Lift, wind, my exile from my eyes;<br>
peace to look, life to listen and <mark4>confess,</mark4><br>
freedom to find to find to <mark4>find</mark4><br>
         that nakedness.<br>
