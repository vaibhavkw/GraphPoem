Title : Vacating an Apartment <br>
Author : Agha Shahid Ali <br><br>

<br>
Efficient as <mark4>Fate,</mark4><br>
each eye a storm <mark4>trooper,</mark4><br>
<br>
the cleaners wipe my <mark4>smile</mark4><br>
with Comet <mark4>fingers</mark4><br>
and tear the <mark4>plaster</mark4><br>
off my suicide <mark4>note.</mark4><br>
<br>
They learn <mark4>everything</mark4><br>
from the walls' eloquent <mark4>tongues.</mark4><br>
<br>
Now, quick as <mark4>genocide,</mark4><br>
they powder my ghost for a cinnamon jar. <br>
<br>
They burn my <mark4>posters</mark4><br>
(India and Heaven in <mark4>flames),</mark4><br>
<br>
whitewash my voicestains, <br>
<br>
make everything new,   <br>
clean as Death. <br>
<br>
When the landlord brings new <mark4>tenants,</mark4><br>
even Memory is a <mark4>stranger.</mark4><br>
The woman, her womb solid with the <mark4>future,</mark4><br>
<br>
instructs her husband's <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
to clutch insurance <mark4>policies.</mark4><br>
They ignore my love affair with the <mark4>furniture,</mark4><br>
<br>
the corner table that <mark4>memorized</mark4><br>
my crossed-out <mark4>lines.</mark4><br>
Oh, she's <mark4>beautiful,</mark4><br>
<br>
a hard-nippled Madonna. <br>
The landlord gives them my autopsy;   <br>
<br>
they sign the <mark4>lease.</mark4><br>
The room is beating with bottled <mark4>infants,</mark4><br>
<br>
and I've stopped <mark4>beating.</mark4><br>
I'm moving out holding tombstones in my <mark4>hands.</mark4><br>
