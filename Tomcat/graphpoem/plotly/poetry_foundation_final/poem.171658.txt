(to JK)<br>
Those scars rooted me. Stigmata <mark5>stalagmite</mark5><br>
I sat at a drive-in and watched the <mark5>stars</mark5><br>
Through a straw while the Coke in my lap went <br>
Waterier and waterier. For days on end <mark3>or</mark3><br>
<br>
Nights no end I crawled on all fours or in <br>
My case no fours to worship you: Amoeba Behemoth. <br>
--Then you explained your DNA calls <mark3>for</mark3><br>
Meaner genes than mine and since you are <mark4>merely</mark4><br>
<br>
So to speak its external expression etcet <br>
Ergo among your lovers I'll never be <mark4>...</mark4><br>
Ah that movie was so faraway the stars melting <br>
<br>
Made my thighs icy. I see: it's not <mark1>you</mark1><br>
Who is not requiting me, it's something in <mark1>you</mark1><br>
Over which you have no say says no to <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
