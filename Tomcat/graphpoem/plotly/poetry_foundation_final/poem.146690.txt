Title : Toth Farry <br>
Author : Sharon Olds <br><br>

In the back of the charm-box, in a sack, the baby    <br>
canines and incisors are mostly <mark3>chaff,</mark3><br>
by now, split kernels and acicular down, no   <br>
whole utensils left: <mark3>half</mark3><br>
an adz; half a shovel, in its <mark4>broken</mark4><br>
handle a marrow well of the will   <br>
to dig and bite. And the enamel <mark4>hems</mark4><br>
are sharp as shell-tools, and the colors go from   <br>
salt, to bone, to pee on snow, to   <br>
sun on pond-ice embedded with <mark4>twigs</mark4><br>
and chipped-off skate-blade. One cuspid   <br>
is like the tail of an ivory chough   <br>
on my grandmother's what-not in a gravure on my <mark4>mother's</mark4><br>
bureau in my father's house in my <mark4>head,</mark4><br>
I think it's our <mark4>daughter's</mark4>, but the dime <mark4>Hermes</mark4><br>
mingled the deciduals of our girl and boy, <mark4>safe-</mark4><br>
keeping them together with the note that <mark4>says</mark4><br>
Dear Toth Farry, Plees Giv Me   <br>
A Bag of Moany. I pore over the <mark4>shards,</mark4><br>
a skeleton-lover--but who could throw <mark4>out</mark4><br>
these short pints of osseus breastmilk,   <br>
or the wisdom, with its charnel <mark4>underside,</mark4><br>
and its dome, smooth and <mark4>experienced,</mark4><br>
ground in <mark4>anger</mark4>, rinsed in <mark4>silver</mark4><br>
when the mouth waters. From above, its knurls   <br>
are a cusp-ring of mountain tops   <br>
around an amber crevasse, where in high   <br>
summer the summit wildflowers <mark4>open</mark4><br>
for a day--Crown Buttercup, Alpine <mark4>Flames,</mark4><br>
Shooting-Star, Rosy Fairy <mark4>Lantern,</mark4><br>
Cream Sacs, Sugar Scoop.<br>
