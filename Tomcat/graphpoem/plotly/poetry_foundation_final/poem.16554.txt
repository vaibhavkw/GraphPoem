Title : Anniversary <br>
Author : Marie Ponsot <br><br>

The big doll being broken and the sawdust <mark3>fall</mark3><br>
all scattered by my shoes, not crying<br>
I sit in my dark to discover o failure <mark4>annulled</mark4><br>
opens out in my hands a purse of <mark4>golden</mark4><br>
salvaged sovereigns, from floors of seas <mark4>culled.</mark4><br>
<br>
The dancing doll split in an anguish and <mark3>all</mark3><br>
 the cords of its elegant limbs unstrung; I <br>
stumble whistling; the bones of my <mark4>skull</mark4><br>
marvelously start to sing, the whole <mark4>shell</mark4><br>
of myself invents without peril and contains a court aubade. <br>
<br>
I hid the dovesmall doll but something found it. <mark4>Frightened</mark4><br>
I gave the fire what was left. Surrounding, it <mark4>mulled</mark4><br>
dulcet over the melting jeweled two blue <mark4>eyes.</mark4><br>
That night our hearth was desolate, but then its <mark4>stones</mark4><br>
sprung flowered and the soaring rafters arched. <br>
<br>
Now all the house laughs, the sun shouts out clearly: <mark4>dawn!</mark4><br>
the sea owes us all its treasures; under the soft the riotous <br>
explosion of our waking kiss or gift, a stone plucked or <mark4>shorn</mark4><br>
free of gravity falls upward for us, slow, and lies there, quietly.<br>
