Title : Delia 33: When men shall find thy flower, thy glory, pass <br>
Author : Samuel Daniel <br><br>

<br>
When men shall find thy flower, thy glory, <mark3>pass,</mark3><br>
And thou with careful brow sitting <mark4>alone</mark4><br>
Received hast this message from thy <mark3>glass,</mark3><br>
That tells thee truth and says that all is <mark4>gone:</mark4><br>
Fresh shalt thou see in me the wounds thou madest,<br>
Though spent thy flame, in me the heat <mark3>remaining;</mark3><br>
I that have lov'd thee thus before thou fadest,<br>
My faith shall wax when thou art in thy <mark3>waning.</mark3><br>
The world shall find this miracle in <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
That fire can burn when all the matter's <mark3>spent;</mark3><br>
Then what my faith hath been thyself shall <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
And that thou wast unkind thou mayst <mark3>repent.</mark3><br>
Thou mayst repent that thou hast scorn'd my <mark3>tears,</mark3><br>
When winter snows upon thy golden <mark3>hairs.</mark3><br>
