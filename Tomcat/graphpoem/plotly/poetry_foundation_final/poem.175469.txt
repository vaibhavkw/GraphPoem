Title : Discourse on Pure Virtue <br>
Author : George Elliott Clarke <br><br>

a Geeta<br>
The brown girl, golden, sable-eyed, <br>
flourishing yellow hibiscus, <br>
steps <mark4>exuberant</mark4>, <mark4>august,</mark4><br>
into <mark1>August--</mark1><br>
her lushly brocaded gold silk <mark4>sari</mark4><br>
lavishing honey light at her auburn <mark4>feet,</mark4><br>
sandalled, cedarly, <br>
with scent of sandalwood haloing her, <br>
her individualized, warm, light-dark <mark4>body,</mark4><br>
her every glance a direction of the air, <br>
her look of mischievous--even tart--sweetness.... <br>
O has she...? <br>
She <mark4>has</mark4><br>
come in from morning's slight autumnal chill, <br>
her feet moistened with diamantine dew-- <br>
how the sea summers in <mark4>grass</mark4><br>
(that same grass that rears at the sun <br>
while butterflies mob frangipani...). <br>
Behold her smile <mark4>declaring</mark4><br>
warm, sun-dyed, terracotta <mark4>lips--</mark4><br>
that chance come <mark4>home--</mark4><br>
and I <mark4>answer,</mark4><br>
"You are light <mark4>uplifting,</mark4><br>
liberating me from <mark4>murk,</mark4><br>
from an inferno of <mark4>squalor."</mark4><br>
O! Let there be rum and <mark4>molasses,</mark4><br>
rice and mackerel, O <mark4>Muse,</mark4><br>
the Indian Ocean softening and sweetening the <mark4>Atlantic,</mark4><br>
this august <mark4>autumn.</mark4><br>
All these pleasures we will prove: <br>
lotus like slow-motion <mark4>lightning,</mark4><br>
ivory gold fountaining from <mark1>earth,</mark1><br>
like you, a fresh light, sprung from <mark1>earth.</mark1><br>
