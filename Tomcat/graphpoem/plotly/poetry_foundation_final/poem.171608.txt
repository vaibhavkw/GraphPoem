Title : Passing <br>
Author : Toi Derricotte <br><br>

A professor invites me to his "Black Lit" class; <mark4>they're</mark4><br>
reading Larson's Passing. One of the <mark5>black</mark5><br>
students says, "Sometimes light-skinned <mark5>blacks</mark5><br>
think they can fool other <mark1>blacks,</mark1><br>
but I can always tell," <mark4>looking</mark4><br>
right through <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
After I tell them I am <mark1>black,</mark1><br>
I ask the class, "Was I <mark4>passing</mark4><br>
when I was just sitting <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
before I told you?" A white <mark4>woman</mark4><br>
shakes her head desperately, as if <br>
I had deliberately deceived <mark5>her.</mark5><br>
She keeps examining my <mark4>face,</mark4><br>
then turning away <br>
as if she hopes I'll disappear. Why presume <br>
"passing" is based on what I leave <mark4>out</mark4><br>
and not what she fills <mark4>in?</mark4><br>
In one scene in the book, in a <mark4>restaurant,</mark4><br>
she's <mark2>"passing,"</mark2><br>
though no one checked her at the <mark4>door--</mark4><br>
"Hey, you <mark1>black?"</mark1><br>
My father, who looked <mark4>white,</mark4><br>
told me this story: every <mark4>year</mark4><br>
when he'd go to get his driver's <mark4>license,</mark4><br>
the man at the window <mark4>filling</mark4><br>
out the form would <mark4>ask,</mark4><br>
"White or black?" pencil poised, without looking up. <br>
My father wouldn't pass, but he <mark3>might</mark3><br>
use silence to trap a devil. <br>
When he didn't speak, the <mark4>man</mark4><br>
would look up at my father's <mark1>face.</mark1><br>
"What did he <mark3>write?"</mark3><br>
my father quizzed <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
