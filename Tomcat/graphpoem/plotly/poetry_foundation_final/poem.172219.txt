Title : Then and Now <br>
Author : Babette Deutsch <br><br>

Then was the grown-up world of tall <mark3>decision,</mark3><br>
Its beauty of late nights denied a <mark3>child;</mark3><br>
World of bewildering gifts, and strange <mark3>derision,</mark3><br>
Alien alike whether it frowned or <mark3>smiled,</mark3><br>
Yet your least wish was governed by its <mark3>laws.</mark3><br>
The landscape and the weather both were <mark4>odd,</mark4><br>
Exploding with effects that hid a <mark3>cause</mark3><br>
Serene and lonely as the Will of <mark3>God.</mark3><br>
Recall it: peopled by an august <mark4>race,</mark4><br>
Immune to the passions that attack the <mark3>young,</mark3><br>
And knowing all. There every <mark4>commonplace</mark4><br>
Must be translated from a marvellous <mark3>tongue.</mark3><br>
<br>
Now is the world of grandeur dwindled, <mark3>shrunk</mark3><br>
To what the stupidest can <mark4>understand.</mark4><br>
The shabby treasures of an exile's <mark3>trunk</mark3><br>
Include no passport to that <mark4>wonderland,</mark4><br>
Though you are told you are a <mark4>citizen.</mark4><br>
The scenery is changed, the climate <mark4>dull;</mark4><br>
The fateful masks are faces, gods are <mark4>men;</mark4><br>
Most nights are long and few are <mark4>magical.</mark4><br>
But there are strangers even here: their <mark3>speech</mark3><br>
Is rich in barbarous mystery, their <mark4>ways</mark4><br>
Are private, who live wholly beyond <mark3>reach,</mark3><br>
Admired and feared, though none of us <mark3>obeys</mark3><br>
Their foreign rule. No dictators, and <mark3>yet</mark3><br>
Strong utterly. While we, with pity <mark3>wrung</mark3><br>
For what they must do, suffer, learn, <mark3>forget,</mark3><br>
Feel shy when we approach them. They are <mark1>young.</mark1><br>
