Title : A Swimmer's Dream <br>
Author : Algernon Charles Swinburne <br><br>

NOVEMBER 4, 1889  Somno mollior unda<br>
<br>
Dawn is dim on the dark soft <mark3>water,</mark3><br>
Soft and <mark4>passionate</mark4>, dark and <mark4>sweet.</mark4><br>
Love's own self was the deep sea's <mark3>daughter,</mark3><br>
Fair and flawless from face to <mark3>feet,</mark3><br>
Hailed of all when the world was <mark3>golden,</mark3><br>
Loved of lovers whose names <mark3>beholden</mark3><br>
Thrill men's eyes as with light of <mark3>olden</mark3><br>
Days more glad than their flight was <mark3>fleet.</mark3><br>
<br>
So they sang: but for men that love <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
Souls that hear not her word in <mark4>vain,</mark4><br>
Earth beside her and heaven above <mark1>her</mark1><br>
Seem but shadows that wax and <mark3>wane.</mark3><br>
Softer than sleep's are the sea's <mark3>caresses,</mark3><br>
Kinder than love's that betrays and <mark3>blesses,</mark3><br>
Blither than spring's when her flowerful <mark3>tresses</mark3><br>
Shake forth sunlight and shine with <mark3>rain.</mark3><br>
<br>
All the strength of the waves that <mark3>perish</mark3><br>
Swells beneath me and laughs and <mark4>sighs,</mark4><br>
Sighs for love of the life they <mark3>cherish,</mark3><br>
Laughs to know that it lives and <mark3>dies,</mark3><br>
Dies for joy of its life, and <mark4>lives</mark4><br>
Thrilled with joy that its brief death gives <mark3>--</mark3><br>
Death whose laugh or whose breath <mark3>forgives</mark3><br>
Change that bids it subside and <mark4>rise.</mark4><br>
<br>
Hard and heavy, remote but <mark3>nearing,</mark3><br>
Sunless hangs the severe sky's <mark4>weight,</mark4><br>
Cloud on cloud, though the wind be <mark3>veering</mark3><br>
Heaped on high to the sundawn's <mark3>gate.</mark3><br>
Dawn and even and noon are <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
Veiled with vapour and void of <mark3>sun;</mark3><br>
Nought in sight or in fancied <mark4>hearing</mark4><br>
Now less mighty than time or <mark3>fate.</mark3><br>
The grey sky gleams and the grey seas <mark4>glimmer,</mark4><br>
<br>
Pale and sweet as a dream's <mark4>delight,</mark4><br>
As a dream's where darkness and light seem <mark3>dimmer,</mark3><br>
Touched by dawn or subdued by <mark3>night.</mark3><br>
The dark <mark4>wind</mark4>, stern and sublime and <mark4>sad,</mark4><br>
Swings the rollers to <mark4>westward</mark4>, <mark3>clad</mark3><br>
With lustrous shadow that lures the <mark3>swimmer,</mark3><br>
Lures and lulls him with dreams of <mark3>light.</mark3><br>
Light, and sleep, and delight, and <mark4>wonder,</mark4><br>
<br>
Change, and rest, and a charm of <mark4>cloud,</mark4><br>
Fill the world of the skies whereunder <br>
Heaves and quivers and pants <mark3>aloud</mark3><br>
All the world of the waters, <mark3>hoary</mark3><br>
Now, but clothed with its own live <mark3>glory,</mark3><br>
That mates the lightning and mocks the <mark3>thunder</mark3><br>
With light more living and word more <mark3>proud.</mark3><br>
Far off westward, whither sets the sounding <mark3>strife,</mark3><br>
<br>
Strife more sweet than peace, of shoreless waves whose <mark3>glee</mark3><br>
Scorns the shore and loves the wind that leaves them <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
Strange as sleep and pale as death and fair as <mark3>life,</mark3><br>
Shifts the moonlight-coloured sunshine on the <mark3>sea.</mark3><br>
Toward the sunset's goal the sunless waters <mark3>crowd,</mark3><br>
Fast as autumn days toward winter: yet it <mark4>seems</mark4><br>
<br>
Here that autumn wanes not, here that woods and <mark3>streams</mark3><br>
Lose not heart and change not likeness, chilled and <mark3>bowed,</mark3><br>
Warped and wrinkled: here the days are fair as <mark3>dreams.</mark3><br>
O russet-robed <mark4>November,</mark4><br>
What ails thee so to <mark3>smile?</mark3><br>
<br>
Chill August, pale <mark3>September,</mark3><br>
Endured a woful <mark3>while,</mark3><br>
And fell as falls an <mark3>ember</mark3><br>
From forth a flameless <mark3>pile:</mark3><br>
But golden-girt <mark1>November</mark1><br>
Bids all she looks on <mark1>smile.</mark1><br>
The lustrous foliage, <mark4>waning</mark4><br>
As wanes the morning <mark4>moon,</mark4><br>
Here <mark4>falling</mark4>, here <mark3>refraining,</mark3><br>
<br>
Outbraves the pride of <mark3>June</mark3><br>
With statelier semblance, <mark3>feigning</mark3><br>
No fear lest death be <mark3>soon:</mark3><br>
As though the woods thus <mark1>waning</mark1><br>
Should wax to meet the <mark1>moon.</mark1><br>
As though, when fields lie <mark4>stricken</mark4><br>
By grey December's <mark3>breath,</mark3><br>
These lordlier growths that <mark3>sicken</mark3><br>
<br>
And die for fear of <mark3>death</mark3><br>
Should feel the sense requicken <br>
      That hears what springtide saith <br>
And thrills for love, <mark3>spring-stricken</mark3><br>
And pierced with April's <mark1>breath.</mark1><br>
The keen white-winged <mark4>north-easter</mark4><br>
That stings and spurs thy <mark1>sea</mark1><br>
Doth yet but feed and feast <mark1>her</mark1><br>
<br>
With glowing sense of <mark1>glee:</mark1><br>
Calm chained <mark1>her</mark1>, storm released <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
And storm's glad voice was <mark3>he:</mark3><br>
South-wester or <mark1>north-easter,</mark1><br>
Thy winds rejoice the <mark1>sea.</mark1><br>
A dream, a dream is it all -- the <mark4>season,</mark4><br>
The sky, the water, the wind, the <mark3>shore?</mark3><br>
A day-born dream of divine unreason, <br>
<br>
A marvel moulded of sleep -- no <mark3>more?</mark3><br>
For the cloudlike wave that my limbs while cleaving <br>
Feel as in slumber beneath them <mark4>heaving</mark4><br>
Soothes the sense as to slumber, <mark3>leaving</mark3><br>
Sense of nought that was known of <mark3>yore.</mark3><br>
A purer passion, a lordlier <mark4>leisure,</mark4><br>
A peace more happy than lives on <mark4>land,</mark4><br>
Fulfils with pulse of diviner <mark3>pleasure</mark3><br>
The dreaming head and the steering <mark3>hand.</mark3><br>
<br>
I lean my cheek to the cold grey <mark5>pillow,</mark5><br>
The deep soft swell of the full broad <mark3>billow,</mark3><br>
And close mine eyes for delight past <mark3>measure,</mark3><br>
And wish the wheel of the world would <mark3>stand.</mark3><br>
The wild-winged hour that we fain would <mark4>capture</mark4><br>
Falls as from heaven that its light feet <mark5>clomb,</mark5><br>
So brief, so soft, and so full the <mark3>rapture</mark3><br>
Was felt that soothed me with sense of <mark3>home.</mark3><br>
<br>
To sleep, to swim, and to dream, for ever <mark4>--</mark4><br>
Such joy the vision of man saw <mark3>never;</mark3><br>
For here too soon will a dark day <mark3>sever</mark3><br>
The sea-bird's wing from the sea-wave's <mark3>foam.</mark3><br>
A dream, and more than a dream, and <mark1>dimmer</mark1><br>
At once and brighter than dreams that <mark3>flee,</mark3><br>
The moment's joy of the seaward <mark1>swimmer</mark1><br>
Abides, remembered as truth may <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
<br>
Not all the joy and not all the <mark1>glory</mark1><br>
Must fade as leaves when the woods wax <mark1>hoary;</mark1><br>
For there the downs and the sea-banks <mark1>glimmer,</mark1><br>
And here to south of them swells the <mark1>sea.</mark1><br>
