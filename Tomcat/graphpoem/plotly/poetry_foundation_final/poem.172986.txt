Title : My Heart and I <br>
Author : Elizabeth Barrett Browning <br><br>

<br>
ENOUGH ! we're tired, my heart and <mark1>I.</mark1><br>
We sit beside the headstone <mark3>thus,</mark3><br>
And wish that name were carved for <mark3>us.</mark3><br>
The moss reprints more tenderly<br>
The hard types of the mason's <mark3>knife,</mark3><br>
As heaven's sweet life renews earth's <mark3>life</mark3><br>
With which we're tired, my heart and <mark1>I.</mark1><br>
<br>
You see we're tired, my heart and <mark1>I.</mark1><br>
We dealt with books, we trusted <mark3>men,</mark3><br>
And in our own blood drenched the <mark3>pen,</mark3><br>
As if such colours could not <mark3>fly.</mark3><br>
We walked too straight for fortune's <mark3>end,</mark3><br>
We loved too true to keep a friend <mark3>;</mark3><br>
At last we're tired, my heart and <mark1>I.</mark1><br>
How tired we feel, my heart and I <mark1>!</mark1><br>
<br>
We seem of no use in the world <mark4>;</mark4><br>
    Our fancies hang grey and uncurled<br>
About men's eyes indifferently ;<br>
Our voice which thrilled you so, will <mark3>let</mark3><br>
You sleep; our tears are only wet <mark3>:</mark3><br>
What do we here, my heart and I <mark1>?</mark1><br>
So tired, so tired, my heart and I <mark1>!</mark1><br>
It was not thus in that old <mark3>time</mark3><br>
<br>
When Ralph sat with me 'neath the <mark3>lime</mark3><br>
To watch the sunset from the <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
Dear love, you're looking tired,' he <mark4>said;</mark4><br>
I, smiling at him, shook my head <mark3>:</mark3><br>
'Tis now we're tired, my heart and <mark1>I.</mark1><br>
So tired, so tired, my heart and I <mark1>!</mark1><br>
Though now none takes me on his <mark4>arm</mark4><br>
To fold me close and kiss me <mark4>warm</mark4><br>
<br>
Till each quick breath end in a <mark3>sigh</mark3><br>
Of happy languor. Now, <mark4>alone,</mark4><br>
We lean upon this graveyard <mark3>stone,</mark3><br>
Uncheered, unkissed, my heart and <mark1>I.</mark1><br>
Tired out we are, my heart and <mark1>I.</mark1><br>
    Suppose the world brought diadems<br>
    To tempt us, crusted with loose gems<br>
Of powers and pleasures ? Let it <mark3>try.</mark3><br>
<br>
We scarcely care to look at <mark4>even</mark4><br>
A pretty child, or God's blue <mark4>heaven,</mark4><br>
We feel so tired, my heart and <mark1>I.</mark1><br>
Yet who complains ? My heart and I <mark1>?</mark1><br>
In this abundant earth no <mark4>doubt</mark4><br>
Is little room for things worn out <mark3>:</mark3><br>
Disdain them, break them, throw them <mark3>by</mark3><br>
And if before the days grew <mark4>rough</mark4><br>
<br>
We once were loved, used, ? well <mark3>enough,</mark3><br>
I think, we've fared, my heart and <mark1>I.</mark1><br>
