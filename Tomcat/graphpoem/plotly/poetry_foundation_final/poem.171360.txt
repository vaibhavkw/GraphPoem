Title : Zeus and Apollo <br>
Author : David Rivard <br><br>

Written on clapboard or asbestos siding, the cartoony   <br>
spray-paint signatures of Apollo and <mark4>Zeus,</mark4><br>
two home boys out bombing last night in thick <mark1>fog.</mark1><br>
Fog near the shade of pearls. Except they didn't see the <mark4>mist</mark4><br>
that way, glad for their thin leather <mark4>gloves.</mark4><br>
Wind raw at the wide avenue, so they <mark4>cut</mark4><br>
from there to here. <br>
Even if this is in the <mark4>past</mark4><br>
tense, tense of the totally <mark4>chilled-out,</mark4><br>
even if they argued here over Krylon blue or candy-apple <mark4>red,</mark4><br>
that doesn't mean they knocked-off and streaked home then.   <br>
And if I saw fog the shade of <mark4>pearls</mark4><br>
it doesn't mean my heart in its own corrosive and healing <mark1>fog</mark1><br>
can't tug on thin leather gloves and <mark4>stand</mark4><br>
in front of a wall, pissing off the <mark4>Fates</mark4><br>
and whoever else owns that wall. Whoever owns <mark4>it</mark4><br>
means less than the dry, fallen leaves of <mark4>eucalyptus</mark4><br>
blown crackling over tar and <mark4>concrete</mark4><br>
and sounding, when you shut your eyes, like every tree   <br>
bursting into leaf for the first time, speeded-up <br>
like the first minute of the <mark4>world.</mark4><br>
