Title : Song: If you refuse me once, and think again <br>
Author : Sir John Suckling <br><br>

If you refuse me once, and think <mark3>again,</mark3><br>
I will <mark3>complain.</mark3><br>
You are deceiv'd, love is no work of <mark3>art,</mark3><br>
It must be got and <mark4>born,</mark4><br>
Not made and <mark3>worn,</mark3><br>
By every one that hath a <mark3>heart.</mark3><br>
<br>
Or do you think they more than once can <mark3>die,</mark3><br>
Whom you <mark3>deny?</mark3><br>
Who tell you of a thousand deaths a <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
Like the old poets <mark4>feign</mark4><br>
And tell the <mark3>pain</mark3><br>
They met, but in the common <mark3>way?</mark3><br>
<br>
Or do you think 't too soon to <mark3>yield,</mark3><br>
And quit the <mark3>field?</mark3><br>
Nor is that right, they yield that first entreat; <br>
Once one may crave for <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
But more would <mark4>prove</mark4><br>
This heart too little, that too <mark4>great.</mark4><br>
<br>
Oh that I were all soul, that I might <mark1>prove</mark1><br>
For you as fit a <mark1>love</mark1><br>
As you are for an angel; for I know, <br>
None but pure spirits are fit loves for you. <br>
<br>
You are all ethereal; there's in you no <mark4>dross,</mark4><br>
Nor any part that's <mark4>gross.</mark4><br>
Your coarsest part is like a curious <mark4>lawn,</mark4><br>
The vestal relics for a covering <mark3>drawn.</mark3><br>
<br>
Your other parts, part of the purest <mark3>fire</mark3><br>
That e'er Heav'n did <mark3>inspire,</mark3><br>
Makes every thought that is refin'd by <mark4>it</mark4><br>
A quintessence of goodness and of <mark3>wit.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thus have your raptures reach'd to that <mark3>degree</mark3><br>
      In love's philosophy, <br>
That you can figure to yourself a <mark1>fire</mark1><br>
Void of all heat, a love without <mark3>desire.</mark3><br>
<br>
Nor in divinity do you go <mark4>less;</mark4><br>
You think, and you <mark3>profess,</mark3><br>
That souls may have a plenitude of <mark3>joy,</mark3><br>
Although their bodies meet not to <mark3>employ.</mark3><br>
<br>
But I must needs confess, I do not <mark4>find</mark4><br>
The motions of my <mark3>mind</mark3><br>
So purified as <mark4>yet</mark4>, but at the <mark4>best</mark4><br>
My body claims in them an <mark4>interest.</mark4><br>
<br>
I hold that perfect joy makes all our <mark4>parts</mark4><br>
As joyful as our <mark3>hearts.</mark3><br>
Our senses tell us, if we please not <mark4>them,</mark4><br>
Our love is but a dotage or a <mark4>dream.</mark4><br>
<br>
How shall we then agree? you may <mark4>descend,</mark4><br>
But will not, to my <mark3>end.</mark3><br>
I fain would tune my fancy to your <mark3>key,</mark3><br>
But cannot reach to that obstructed <mark1>way.</mark1><br>
<br>
There rests but this, that whilst we sorrow <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
Our bodies may draw <mark4>near;</mark4><br>
<mark4>And</mark4>, when no more their joys they can <mark3>extend,</mark3><br>
Then let our souls begin where they did <mark1>end.</mark1><br>
