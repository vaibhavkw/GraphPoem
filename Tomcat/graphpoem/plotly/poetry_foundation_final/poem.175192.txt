Title : State's Attorney Fallas <br>
Author : Edgar Lee Masters <br><br>

I, the scourge-wielder, <mark4>balance-wrecker,</mark4><br>
Smiter with whips and <mark4>swords;</mark4><br>
I, hater of the breakers of the law; <br>
I, legalist, inexorable and <mark4>bitter,</mark4><br>
Driving the jury to hang the <mark4>madman</mark4>, Barry <mark4>Holden,</mark4><br>
Was made as one dead by light too bright for <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
And woke to face a Truth with bloody brow: <br>
Steel forceps fumbled by a doctor's <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
Against my boy's head as he entered life <br>
Made him an idiot. <br>
I turned to books of science <br>
To care for him. <br>
That's how the world of those whose minds are sick <br>
Became my work in life, and all my <mark4>world.</mark4><br>
Poor ruined boy! You were, at last, the <mark4>potter</mark4><br>
And I and all my deeds of charity <br>
The vessels of your <mark1>hand.</mark1><br>
