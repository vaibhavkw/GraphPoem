Title : The Rattling Boy from Dublin <br>
Author : Knight of the White Elephant of Burmah William McGonagall <br><br>

I'm a rattling boy from Dublin <mark3>town,</mark3><br>
I courted a girl called Biddy <mark3>Brown,</mark3><br>
Her eyes they were as black as sloes,<br>
       She had black hair and an aquiline nose.<br>
<br>
Whack fal de da, fal de <mark5>darelido,</mark5><br>
<br>
Whack fal de da, fal de <mark5>darelay,</mark5><br>
Whack fal de da, fal de <mark1>darelido,</mark1><br>
Whack fal de da, fal de <mark1>darelay.</mark1><br>
One night I met her with another <mark3>lad,</mark3><br>
<br>
Says I, Biddy, I've caught you, by <mark3>dad;</mark3><br>
I never thought you were half so <mark3>bad</mark3><br>
As to be going about with another <mark1>lad.</mark1><br>
Says I, Biddy, this will never <mark3>do,</mark3><br>
<br>
For to-night you've prov'd to me <mark3>untrue,</mark3><br>
<br>
So do not make a hullaballoo,<br>
For I will bid farewell to <mark3>you.</mark3><br>
Says Barney Magee, She is my <mark3>lass,</mark3><br>
And the man that says no, he is an <mark3>ass,</mark3><br>
<br>
So come away, and I'll give you a <mark3>glass,</mark3><br>
<br>
Och, sure you can get another <mark1>lass.</mark1><br>
Says I, To the devil with your <mark1>glass,</mark1><br>
You have taken from me my darling <mark1>lass,</mark1><br>
And if you look angry, or offer to <mark3>frown,</mark3><br>
<br>
With my darling shillelah I'll knock you <mark3>down.</mark3><br>
<br>
Says Barney Magee unto <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
By the hokey I love Biddy <mark1>Brown,</mark1><br>
And before I'll give her up to <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
One or both of us will go <mark1>down.</mark1><br>
<br>
So, with my darling shillelah, I gave him a <mark3>whack,</mark3><br>
<br>
Which left him lying on his <mark3>back,</mark3><br>
Saying, botheration to you and Biddy <mark1>Brown,--</mark1><br>
For I'm the rattling boy from Dublin <mark1>town.</mark1><br>
So a policeman chanced to come up at the time,<br>
<br>
And he asked of me the cause of the <mark4>shine,</mark4><br>
<br>
Says I, he threatened to knock me <mark1>down</mark1><br>
When I challenged him for walking with my Biddy <mark1>Brown.</mark1><br>
So the policeman took Barney Magee to jail,<br>
       Which made him shout and bewail<br>
<br>
That ever he met with Biddy <mark1>Brown,</mark1><br>
<br>
The greatest deceiver in Dublin <mark1>town.</mark1><br>
So I bade farewell to Biddy <mark1>Brown,</mark1><br>
The greatest jilter in Dublin <mark1>town,</mark1><br>
Because she proved untrue to <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
<br>
And was going about with Barney <mark3>Magee.</mark3><br>
