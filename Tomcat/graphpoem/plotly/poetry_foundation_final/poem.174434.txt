Title : "Leave me, O Love, which reachest but to dust" <br>
Author : Sir Philip Sidney <br><br>

from Certain Sonnets<br>
Leave me, O Love, which reachest but to <mark3>dust;</mark3><br>
And thou, my mind, aspire to higher <mark3>things;</mark3><br>
Grow rich in that which never taketh <mark3>rust;</mark3><br>
Whatever fades but fading pleasure <mark3>brings.</mark3><br>
Draw in thy beams and humble all thy <mark4>might</mark4><br>
To that sweet yoke where lasting freedoms <mark3>be;</mark3><br>
Which breaks the clouds and opens forth the <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
That both doth shine and give us sight to <mark3>see.</mark3><br>
O take fast <mark4>hold</mark4>, let that light be thy <mark4>guide</mark4><br>
In this small course which birth draws out to <mark3>death,</mark3><br>
And think how evil becometh him to <mark3>slide,</mark3><br>
Who seeketh heav'n, and comes of heav'nly <mark3>breath.</mark3><br>
Then farewell, world; thy uttermost I <mark1>see:</mark1><br>
Eternal Love, maintain thy life in <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
