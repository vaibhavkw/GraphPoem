Title : Don Juan: Canto 11 <br>
Author : Lord Byron (George Gordon) <br><br>

<br>
When Bishop Berkeley said "there was no <mark3>matter,"</mark3><br>
And proved it--'twas no matter what he <mark3>said:</mark3><br>
They say his system 'tis in vain to <mark3>batter,</mark3><br>
Too subtle for the airiest human <mark3>head;</mark3><br>
And yet who can believe it! I would <mark3>shatter</mark3><br>
Gladly all matters down to stone or <mark3>lead,</mark3><br>
Or <mark4>adamant</mark4>, to find the World a <mark4>spirit,</mark4><br>
And wear my head, denying that I wear <mark3>it.</mark3><br>
<br>
What a sublime discovery 'twas to make <mark1>the</mark1><br>
Universe universal <mark4>egotism,</mark4><br>
That all's ideal--all ourselves: I'll stake <mark1>the</mark1><br>
World (be it what you will) that that's no <mark4>schism.</mark4><br>
Oh Doubt!--if thou be'st Doubt, for which some take <mark5>thee,</mark5><br>
But which I doubt extremely--thou sole <mark3>prism</mark3><br>
Of the Truth's rays, spoil not my draught of <mark1>spirit!</mark1><br>
Heaven's brandy, though our brain can hardly bear <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
For ever and anon comes <mark3>Indigestion</mark3><br>
<br>
(Not the most "dainty Ariel") and <mark3>perplexes</mark3><br>
Our soarings with another sort of <mark3>question:</mark3><br>
       And that which after all my spirit vexes, <br>
Is, that I find no spot where Man can rest eye <mark4>on,</mark4><br>
Without confusion of the sorts and <mark3>sexes,</mark3><br>
Of beings, stars, and this unriddled <mark4>wonder,</mark4><br>
The World, which at the worst's a glorious <mark3>blunder--</mark3><br>
If it be chance--or, if it be <mark4>according</mark4><br>
To the Old Text, still better: lest it <mark4>should</mark4><br>
<br>
Turn out so, we'll say nothing 'gainst the <mark4>wording,</mark4><br>
As several people think such hazards <mark4>rude.</mark4><br>
They're right; our days are too brief for <mark4>affording</mark4><br>
Space to dispute what no one ever <mark4>could</mark4><br>
Decide, and everybody one day <mark3>will</mark3><br>
Know very clearly--or at least lie <mark3>still.</mark3><br>
And therefore will I leave off <mark4>metaphysical</mark4><br>
Discussion, which is neither here nor <mark5>there:</mark5><br>
If I agree that what is, is; then this I <mark4>call</mark4><br>
<br>
Being quite perspicuous and extremely <mark3>fair.</mark3><br>
The truth is, I've grown lately rather phthisical: <br>
I don't know what the reason is--the <mark3>air</mark3><br>
<mark4>Perhaps</mark4>, but as I suffer from the <mark5>shocks</mark5><br>
Of <mark4>illness</mark4>, I grow much more <mark4>orthodox.</mark4><br>
The first attack at once prov'd the <mark4>Divinity</mark4><br>
(But that I never doubted, nor the <mark4>Devil);</mark4><br>
The next, the Virgin's mystical <mark4>virginity;</mark4><br>
The third, the usual Origin of <mark4>Evil;</mark4><br>
<br>
The fourth at once establish'd the whole <mark3>Trinity</mark3><br>
On so uncontrovertible a <mark4>level,</mark4><br>
That I devoutly wish'd the three were <mark4>four--</mark4><br>
On purpose to believe so much the <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
To our theme.--The man who has stood on the <mark4>Acropolis,</mark4><br>
And look'd down over Attica; or <mark3>he</mark3><br>
Who has sail'd where picturesque Constantinople <mark3>is,</mark3><br>
Or seen Timbuctoo, or hath taken <mark3>tea</mark3><br>
In small-ey'd China's crockery-ware <mark3>metropolis,</mark3><br>
<br>
Or sat amidst the bricks of <mark4>Nineveh,</mark4><br>
May not think much of London's first <mark4>appearance--</mark4><br>
But ask him what he thinks of it a year <mark4>hence!</mark4><br>
Don Juan had got out on Shooter's <mark4>Hill;</mark4><br>
       Sunset the time, the place the same declivity <br>
Which looks along that vale of good and <mark3>ill</mark3><br>
Where London streets ferment in full <mark4>activity,</mark4><br>
While everything around was calm and <mark1>still,</mark1><br>
Except the creak of wheels, which on their pivot <mark1>he</mark1><br>
<br>
Heard, and that bee-like, bubbling, busy <mark4>hum</mark4><br>
Of cities, that boil over with their <mark3>scum--</mark3><br>
I say, Don <mark4>Juan</mark4>, wrapp'd in <mark4>contemplation,</mark4><br>
Walk'd on behind his carriage, o'er the <mark3>summit,</mark3><br>
And lost in wonder of so great a <mark3>nation,</mark3><br>
Gave way to't, since he could not overcome <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
"And here," he cried, "is Freedom's chosen <mark3>station;</mark3><br>
Here peals the People's voice nor can entomb <mark1>it</mark1><br>
Racks, prisons, inquisitions; <mark4>resurrection</mark4><br>
<br>
Awaits it, each new meeting or <mark3>election.</mark3><br>
"Here are chaste wives, pure lives; her people <mark3>pay</mark3><br>
But what they please; and if that things be <mark4>dear,</mark4><br>
'Tis only that they love to throw <mark3>away</mark3><br>
Their cash, to show how much they have <mark3>a-year.</mark3><br>
Here laws are all inviolate; none <mark3>lay</mark3><br>
Traps for the traveller; every highway's <mark3>clear;</mark3><br>
Here"--he was interrupted by a <mark3>knife,</mark3><br>
With--"Damn your eyes! your money or your <mark3>life!"</mark3><br>
<br>
These free-born sounds proceeded from four <mark4>pads</mark4><br>
In ambush laid, who had perceiv'd him <mark4>loiter</mark4><br>
Behind his carriage; and, like handy <mark3>lads,</mark3><br>
       Had seiz'd the lucky hour to reconnoitre, <br>
In which the heedless gentleman who <mark3>gads</mark3><br>
Upon the road, unless he prove a <mark4>fighter</mark4><br>
May find himself within that isle of <mark4>riches</mark4><br>
Expos'd to lose his life as well as <mark5>breeches.</mark5><br>
Juan, who did not understand a <mark4>word</mark4><br>
<br>
Of English, save their shibboleth, "God <mark4>damn!"</mark4><br>
And even that he had so rarely <mark3>heard,</mark3><br>
He sometimes thought 'twas only their <mark4>Salam,"</mark4><br>
Or "God be with you!"--and 'tis not <mark3>absurd</mark3><br>
To think so, for half English as I <mark4>am</mark4><br>
(To my misfortune) never can I <mark3>say</mark3><br>
I heard them wish "God with you," save that <mark3>way--</mark3><br>
Juan yet quickly understood their <mark4>gesture,</mark4><br>
And being somewhat choleric and <mark4>sudden,</mark4><br>
<br>
Drew forth a pocket pistol from his vesture, <br>
And fired it into one assailant's <mark4>pudding,</mark4><br>
Who fell, as rolls an ox o'er in his <mark4>pasture,</mark4><br>
And roar'd out, as he writh'd his native mud <mark4>in,</mark4><br>
Unto his nearest follower or <mark4>henchman,</mark4><br>
"Oh Jack! I'm floor'd by that ere bloody <mark4>Frenchman!"</mark4><br>
On which Jack and his train set off at <mark4>speed,</mark4><br>
And Juan's suite, late scatter'd at a <mark4>distance,</mark4><br>
Came up, all marvelling at such a <mark3>deed,</mark3><br>
<br>
And offering, as usual, late <mark3>assistance.</mark3><br>
Juan, who saw the moon's late minion <mark3>bleed</mark3><br>
As if his veins would pour out his <mark3>existence,</mark3><br>
Stood calling out for bandages and <mark4>lint,</mark4><br>
And wish'd he had been less hasty with his <mark3>flint.</mark3><br>
"Perhaps,"thought <mark4>he,"i</mark4>, is the country's <mark4>wont</mark4><br>
To welcome foreigners in this way: <mark3>now</mark3><br>
I recollect some innkeepers who <mark3>don't</mark3><br>
Differ, except in robbing with a <mark3>bow,</mark3><br>
<br>
In lieu of a bare blade and brazen <mark4>front.</mark4><br>
But what is to be done? I can't <mark3>allow</mark3><br>
The fellow to lie groaning on the <mark4>road:</mark4><br>
So take him up, I'll help you with the <mark3>load."</mark3><br>
But ere they could perform this pious <mark4>duty,</mark4><br>
The dying man cried, "Hold! I've got my <mark4>gruel!</mark4><br>
Oh! for a glass of max ! We've miss'd our <mark3>booty--</mark3><br>
Let me die where I am!" And as the <mark4>fuel</mark4><br>
Of life shrunk in his heart, and thick and <mark3>sooty</mark3><br>
<br>
The drops fell from his death-wound, and he drew <mark1>ill</mark1><br>
His breath, he from his swelling throat <mark4>untied</mark4><br>
A kerchief, crying "Give Sal that!"--and <mark3>died.</mark3><br>
The cravat stain'd with bloody drops fell <mark4>down</mark4><br>
Before Don Juan's feet: he could not <mark4>tell</mark4><br>
Exactly why it was before him <mark4>thrown,</mark4><br>
Nor what the meaning of the man's <mark3>farewell.</mark3><br>
Poor Tom was once a kiddy upon <mark4>town,</mark4><br>
A thorough varmint, and a real <mark3>swell,</mark3><br>
<br>
Full flash, all fancy, until fairly <mark1>diddled,</mark1><br>
His pockets first and then his body <mark4>riddled.</mark4><br>
Don Juan, having done the best he <mark1>could</mark1><br>
In all the circumstances of the <mark4>case,</mark4><br>
As soon as "Crowner's 'quest" allow'd, <mark5>pursu'd</mark5><br>
His travels to the capital <mark3>apace;</mark3><br>
Esteeming it a little hard he <mark1>should</mark1><br>
In twelve hours' time, and very little <mark3>space,</mark3><br>
Have been oblig'd to slay a free-born <mark5>native</mark5><br>
<br>
In self-defence: this made him <mark4>meditative.</mark4><br>
He from the world had cut off a great <mark4>man,</mark4><br>
Who in his time had made heroic <mark4>bustle.</mark4><br>
Who in a row like Tom could lead the <mark3>van,</mark3><br>
Booze in the ken, or at the spellken <mark3>hustle?</mark3><br>
Who queer a flat? Who (spite of Bowstreet's <mark3>ban)</mark3><br>
On the high toby-spice so flash the <mark4>muzzle?</mark4><br>
Who on a lark, with black-eyed Sal (his <mark4>blowing),</mark4><br>
So prime, so swell, so nutty, and so <mark3>knowing?</mark3><br>
<br>
But Tom's no more--and so no more of <mark4>Tom.</mark4><br>
Heroes must die; and by God's blessing <mark4>'tis</mark4><br>
Not long before the most of them go <mark4>home.</mark4><br>
Hail! Thamis, hail! Upon thy verge it <mark1>is</mark1><br>
That Juan's chariot, rolling like a <mark4>drum</mark4><br>
In thunder, holds the way it can't well <mark4>miss,</mark4><br>
Through Kennington and all the other <mark4>"tons,"</mark4><br>
Which make us wish ourselves in town at <mark4>once;</mark4><br>
Through <mark4>Groves</mark4>, so called as being void of <mark4>trees,</mark4><br>
<br>
(Like lucus from no light); through prospects <mark4>nam'd</mark4><br>
Mount Pleasant, as containing nought to <mark4>please,</mark4><br>
Nor much to climb; through little boxes <mark4>fram'd</mark4><br>
Of bricks, to let the dust in at your <mark4>ease,</mark4><br>
With "To be let," upon their doors <mark4>proclaim'd;</mark4><br>
Through "Rows" most modestly call'd <mark4>"Paradise,"</mark4><br>
Which Eve might quit without much <mark3>sacrifice;</mark3><br>
Through coaches, drays, chok'd turnpikes, and a <mark4>whirl</mark4><br>
Of wheels, and roar of voices, and <mark4>confusion;</mark4><br>
<br>
Here taverns wooing to a pint of "purl," <br>
There mails fast flying off like a <mark3>delusion;</mark3><br>
There barbers' blocks with periwigs in <mark3>curl</mark3><br>
In windows; here the lamplighter's <mark3>infusion</mark3><br>
Slowly distill'd into the glimmering <mark4>glass</mark4><br>
(For in those days we had not got to <mark3>gas);</mark3><br>
Through this, and much, and more, is the <mark5>approach</mark5><br>
Of travellers to mighty <mark4>Babylon:</mark4><br>
Whether they come by horse, or chaise, or <mark3>coach,</mark3><br>
<br>
With slight exceptions, all the ways seem <mark4>one.</mark4><br>
I could say more, but do not choose to <mark3>encroach</mark3><br>
Upon the guide-book's privilege. The <mark3>sun</mark3><br>
Had set some time, and night was on the <mark5>ridge</mark5><br>
Of twilight, as the party cross'd the <mark3>bridge.</mark3><br>
That's rather fine, the gentle sound of <mark5>Thamis--</mark5><br>
Who vindicates a moment, too, his <mark4>stream--</mark4><br>
Though hardly heard through multifarious <mark3>"damme's":</mark3><br>
The lamps of Westminster's more regular <mark3>gleam,</mark3><br>
<br>
The breadth of pavement, and yon shrine where Fame <mark1>is</mark1><br>
A spectral resident--whose pallid <mark3>beam</mark3><br>
In shape of moonshine hovers o'er the <mark4>pile--</mark4><br>
Make this a sacred part of Albion's <mark3>Isle.</mark3><br>
The Druid's groves are gone--so much the <mark4>better:</mark4><br>
Stonehenge is not--but what the devil is <mark1>it?--</mark1><br>
But Bedlam still exists with its sage <mark3>fetter,</mark3><br>
That madmen may not bite you on a <mark3>visit;</mark3><br>
The Bench too seats or suits full many a <mark3>debtor;</mark3><br>
<br>
The Mansion House too (though some people quiz <mark1>it)</mark1><br>
To me appears a stiff yet grand <mark4>erection;</mark4><br>
But then the Abbey's worth the whole <mark3>collection.</mark3><br>
The line of lights too, up to Charing <mark4>Cross,</mark4><br>
Pall Mall, and so forth, have a <mark1>coruscation</mark1><br>
Like gold as in comparison to <mark3>dross,</mark3><br>
Match'd with the Continent's <mark4>illumination,</mark4><br>
Whose cities Night by no means deigns to <mark3>gloss.</mark3><br>
The French were not yet a lamp-lighting <mark1>nation,</mark1><br>
<br>
And when they grew so--on their new-found <mark4>lantern,</mark4><br>
Instead of wicks, they made a wicked man <mark4>turn.</mark4><br>
A row of Gentlemen along the <mark4>streets</mark4><br>
Suspended may illuminate <mark4>mankind,</mark4><br>
As also bonfires made of country <mark3>seats;</mark3><br>
But the old way is best for the <mark5>purblind:</mark5><br>
The other looks like phosphorus on <mark3>sheets,</mark3><br>
A sort of ignis fatuus to the <mark3>mind,</mark3><br>
Which, though 'tis certain to perplex and <mark4>frighten,</mark4><br>
<br>
Must burn more mildly ere it can <mark3>enlighten.</mark3><br>
But London's so well lit, that if Diogenes <br>
Could recommence to hunt his honest <mark1>man</mark1><br>
And found him not amidst the various <mark5>progenies</mark5><br>
Of this enormous city's spreading <mark4>spawn,</mark4><br>
'Twere not for want of lamps to aid his dodging <mark3>his</mark3><br>
Yet undiscover'd treasure. What I <mark4>can,</mark4><br>
I've done to find the same throughout life's <mark4>journey,</mark4><br>
But see the World is only one <mark3>attorney.</mark3><br>
<br>
Over the stones still rattling, up Pall <mark4>Mall,</mark4><br>
Through crowds and carriages, but waxing <mark4>thinner</mark4><br>
As thunder'd knockers broke the long seal'd <mark4>spell</mark4><br>
Of doors 'gainst duns, and to an early <mark3>dinner</mark3><br>
Admitted a small party as night <mark3>fell,</mark3><br>
Don Juan, our young diplomatic <mark3>sinner,</mark3><br>
Pursu'd his path, and drove past some <mark4>hotels,</mark4><br>
St. James's Palace, and St. James's "Hells." <br>
They reach'd the hotel: forth stream'd from the front <mark4>door</mark4><br>
<br>
A tide of well-clad waiters, and <mark4>around</mark4><br>
The mob stood, and as usual several <mark3>score</mark3><br>
Of those pedestrian Paphians who <mark3>abound</mark3><br>
In decent London when the daylight's <mark4>o'er;</mark4><br>
Commodious but immoral, they are <mark3>found</mark3><br>
Useful, like Malthus, in promoting <mark4>marriage:</mark4><br>
But Juan now is stepping from his <mark4>carriage</mark4><br>
Into one of the sweetest of <mark1>hotels,</mark1><br>
Especially for foreigners--and <mark4>mostly</mark4><br>
<br>
For those whom favour or whom fortune <mark3>swells,</mark3><br>
And cannot find a bill's small items <mark4>costly.</mark4><br>
There many an envoy either dwelt or <mark3>dwells</mark3><br>
(The den of many a diplomatic lost <mark3>lie),</mark3><br>
Until to some conspicuous square they <mark4>pass,</mark4><br>
And blazon o'er the door their names in <mark3>brass.</mark3><br>
<mark4>Juan</mark4>, whose was a delicate <mark4>commission,</mark4><br>
Private, though publicly important, <mark3>bore</mark3><br>
No title to point out with due <mark4>precision</mark4><br>
<br>
The exact affair on which he was sent <mark1>o'er.</mark1><br>
'Twas merely <mark4>known</mark4>, that on a secret <mark4>mission</mark4><br>
A foreigner of rank had grac'd our <mark3>shore,</mark3><br>
Young, handsome and accomplish'd, who was <mark1>said</mark1><br>
(In whispers) to have turn'd his Sovereign's <mark1>head.</mark1><br>
Some rumour also of some strange <mark4>adventures</mark4><br>
Had gone before him, and his wars and <mark4>loves;</mark4><br>
And as romantic heads are pretty <mark4>painters,</mark4><br>
       And, above all, an Englishwoman's roves <br>
<br>
Into the excursive, breaking the <mark4>indentures</mark4><br>
Of sober reason, wheresoe'er it <mark4>moves,</mark4><br>
He found himself extremely in the <mark4>fashion,</mark4><br>
Which serves our thinking people for a <mark3>passion.</mark3><br>
I don't mean that they are passionless, but <mark4>quite</mark4><br>
The contrary; but then 'tis in the <mark1>head;</mark1><br>
Yet as the consequences are as <mark3>bright</mark3><br>
As if they acted with the heart <mark3>instead,</mark3><br>
What after all can signify the <mark3>site</mark3><br>
<br>
Of ladies' lucubrations? So they <mark1>lead</mark1><br>
In safety to the place for which you <mark4>start,</mark4><br>
What matters if the road be head or <mark3>heart?</mark3><br>
Juan presented in the proper <mark4>place,</mark4><br>
To proper placement, every Russ <mark4>credential;</mark4><br>
And was receiv'd with all the due <mark4>grimace</mark4><br>
By those who govern in the mood <mark3>potential,</mark3><br>
Who, seeing a handsome stripling with smooth <mark4>face,</mark4><br>
Thought (what in state affairs is most <mark3>essential)</mark3><br>
<br>
That they as easily might  do the <mark4>youngster,</mark4><br>
As hawks may pounce upon a woodland <mark5>songster.</mark5><br>
They err'd, as aged men will do; but <mark3>by</mark3><br>
And by we'll talk of that; and if we <mark1>don't,</mark1><br>
'T will be because our notion is not <mark3>high</mark3><br>
Of politicians and their double <mark1>front,</mark1><br>
Who live by lies, yet dare not boldly <mark1>lie:</mark1><br>
Now, what I love in women is, they <mark4>won't</mark4><br>
Or can't do otherwise than lie, but do <mark1>it</mark1><br>
<br>
So well, the very truth seems falsehood to <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
And, after all, what is a lie? 'Tis <mark4>but</mark4><br>
The truth in masquerade; and I <mark3>defy</mark3><br>
Historians, heroes, lawyers, priests, to <mark4>put</mark4><br>
A fact without some leaven of a <mark1>lie.</mark1><br>
The very shadow of true Truth would <mark4>shut</mark4><br>
Up annals, revelations, <mark5>poesy,</mark5><br>
And prophecy--except it should be <mark4>dated</mark4><br>
Some years before the incidents <mark3>related.</mark3><br>
<br>
Prais'd be all liars and all lies! Who <mark1>now</mark1><br>
Can tax my mild Muse with <mark5>misanthropy?</mark5><br>
She rings the World's "Te Deum," and her <mark3>brow</mark3><br>
Blushes for those who will not: but to <mark3>sigh</mark3><br>
Is idle; let us like most others <mark1>bow,</mark1><br>
Kiss hands, feet, any part of <mark4>Majesty,</mark4><br>
After the good example of "Green <mark4>Erin,"</mark4><br>
Whose shamrock now seems rather worse for <mark4>wearing.</mark4><br>
Don Juan was presented, and his <mark4>dress</mark4><br>
<br>
And mien excited general <mark4>admiration;</mark4><br>
I don't know which was more admir'd or <mark3>less:</mark3><br>
One monstrous diamond drew much <mark3>observation,</mark3><br>
Which Catherine in a moment of "ivresse" <br>
(In love or brandy's fervent <mark3>fermentation)</mark3><br>
Bestow'd upon him, as the public <mark4>learn'd;</mark4><br>
And, to say truth, it had been fairly <mark3>earn'd.</mark3><br>
Besides the ministers and <mark4>underlings,</mark4><br>
Who must be courteous to the <mark4>accredited</mark4><br>
<br>
Diplomatists of rather wavering <mark4>kings,</mark4><br>
Until their royal riddle's fully <mark4>read,</mark4><br>
The very clerks--those somewhat dirty <mark3>springs</mark3><br>
Of Office, or the House of Office, <mark3>fed</mark3><br>
By foul corruption into streams--even <mark3>they</mark3><br>
Were hardly rude enough to earn their <mark1>pay.</mark1><br>
And insolence no doubt is what they <mark3>are</mark3><br>
Employ'd <mark4>for</mark4>, since it is their daily <mark3>labour,</mark3><br>
In the dear offices of peace or <mark4>war;</mark4><br>
<br>
And should you doubt, pray ask of your next <mark3>neighbour,</mark3><br>
When for a passport, or some other <mark4>bar</mark4><br>
To freedom, he applied (a grief and a <mark1>bore),</mark1><br>
If he found not this spawn of tax-born <mark1>riches,</mark1><br>
Like lap-dogs, the least civil sons of b{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}s. <br>
But Juan was receiv'd with much "empressement" -- <br>
These phrases of refinement I must <mark5>borrow</mark5><br>
From our next neighbours' land, where, like a <mark4>chessman,</mark4><br>
There is a move set down for joy or <mark4>sorrow,</mark4><br>
<br>
Not only in mere talking, but the press. <mark1>Man</mark1><br>
In islands is, it seems, downright and <mark4>thorough,</mark4><br>
More than on continents--as if the <mark3>sea</mark3><br>
(See Billingsgate) made even the tongue more <mark3>free.</mark3><br>
And yet the British "Damme" 's rather <mark3>Attic,</mark3><br>
Your continental oaths are but <mark4>incontinent,</mark4><br>
And turn on things which no <mark3>aristocratic</mark3><br>
       Spirit would name, and therefore even I won't anent <br>
This subject quote; as it would be <mark5>schismatic</mark5><br>
<br>
       In politesse, and have a sound affronting in 't; <br>
But "Damme" 's quite ethereal, though too <mark3>daring--</mark3><br>
Platonic blasphemy, the soul of <mark3>swearing.</mark3><br>
For downright rudeness, ye may stay at <mark1>home;</mark1><br>
For true or false politeness (and scarce <mark4>that</mark4><br>
Now) you may cross the blue deep and white <mark3>foam:</mark3><br>
The first the emblem (rarely though) of <mark4>what</mark4><br>
You leave behind, the next of much you <mark4>come</mark4><br>
To meet. However, 'tis no time to <mark4>chat</mark4><br>
<br>
On general topics: poems must <mark4>confine</mark4><br>
Themselves to Unity, like this of <mark3>mine.</mark3><br>
In the great world--which, being <mark4>interpreted,</mark4><br>
Meaneth the West or worst end of a <mark4>city,</mark4><br>
And about twice two thousand people <mark4>bred</mark4><br>
By no means to be very wise or <mark3>witty,</mark3><br>
But to sit up while others lie in <mark3>bed,</mark3><br>
And look down on the Universe with <mark3>pity--</mark3><br>
<mark4>Juan</mark4>, as an inveterate <mark4>patrician,</mark4><br>
<br>
Was well receiv'd by persons of <mark3>condition.</mark3><br>
He was a <mark4>bachelor</mark4>, which is a <mark1>matter</mark1><br>
Of import both to virgin and to <mark4>bride,</mark4><br>
The former's hymeneal hopes to <mark3>flatter;</mark3><br>
And (should she not hold fast by love or <mark3>pride)</mark3><br>
'Tis also of some momemt to the <mark3>latter:</mark3><br>
A rib's a thorn in a wed gallant's <mark3>side,</mark3><br>
Requires decorum, and is apt to <mark4>double</mark4><br>
The horrid sin--and what's still worse the <mark3>trouble.</mark3><br>
<br>
But Juan was a bachelor--of <mark4>arts,</mark4><br>
And parts, and hearts: he danc'd and sung, and <mark4>had</mark4><br>
An air as sentimental as <mark4>Mozart's</mark4><br>
Softest of melodies; and could be <mark3>sad</mark3><br>
Or cheerful, without any "flaws or <mark4>starts,"</mark4><br>
Just at the proper time; and though a <mark3>lad,</mark3><br>
Had seen the world--which is a curious <mark4>sight,</mark4><br>
And very much unlike what people <mark3>write.</mark3><br>
Fair virgins blush'd upon him; wedded <mark4>dames</mark4><br>
<br>
Bloom'd also in less transitory <mark4>hues;</mark4><br>
For both commodities dwell by the <mark4>Thames</mark4><br>
The painting and the painted; Youth, Ceruse, <br>
Against his heart preferr'd their usual <mark4>claims,</mark4><br>
Such as no gentleman can quite <mark4>refuse;</mark4><br>
Daughters admir'd his dress, and pious <mark4>mothers</mark4><br>
Inquir'd his income, and if he had <mark3>brothers.</mark3><br>
The milliners who furnish "drapery <mark4>Misses"</mark4><br>
Throughout the <mark4>season</mark4>, upon <mark4>speculation</mark4><br>
<br>
Of payment ere the Honeymoon's last <mark3>kisses</mark3><br>
Have wan'd into a crescent's <mark1>coruscation,</mark1><br>
Thought such an opportunity as this <mark1>is,</mark1><br>
Of a rich foreigner's <mark3>initiation,</mark3><br>
Not to be overlook'd--and gave such <mark4>credit,</mark4><br>
That future bridegrooms swore, and sigh'd, and paid <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
The Blues, that tender tribe, who sigh o'er <mark4>sonnets,</mark4><br>
And with the pages of the last <mark3>Review</mark3><br>
Line the interior of their heads or bonnets, <br>
<br>
Advanc'd in all their azure's highest <mark3>hue:</mark3><br>
They talk'd bad French or Spanish, and upon <mark3>its</mark3><br>
Late authors ask'd him for a hint or <mark3>two;</mark3><br>
And which was softest, Russian or Castilian? <br>
And whether in his travels he saw Ilion? <br>
Juan, who was a little <mark4>superficial,</mark4><br>
       And not in literature a great Drawcansir, <br>
Examin'd by this learned and <mark4>especial</mark4><br>
Jury of matrons, scarce knew what to <mark4>answer:</mark4><br>
<br>
His duties warlike, loving or <mark4>official,</mark4><br>
His steady application as a <mark3>dancer,</mark3><br>
Had kept him from the brink of Hippocrene, <br>
Which now he found was blue instead of <mark4>green.</mark4><br>
However, he replied at hazard, <mark5>with</mark5><br>
A modest confidence and calm <mark4>assurance,</mark4><br>
Which lent his learned lucubrations <mark3>pith,</mark3><br>
And pass'd for arguments of good <mark4>endurance.</mark4><br>
That prodigy, Miss Araminta <mark3>Smith</mark3><br>
<br>
       (Who at sixteen translated "Hercules Furens" <br>
Into as furious English), with her best <mark4>look,</mark4><br>
Set down his sayings in her common-place <mark3>book.</mark3><br>
Juan knew several languages--as <mark4>well</mark4><br>
He might--and brought them up with skill, in <mark4>time</mark4><br>
To save his fame with each accomplish'd <mark3>belle,</mark3><br>
Who still regretted that he did not <mark3>rhyme.</mark3><br>
There wanted but this requisite to <mark1>swell</mark1><br>
His qualities (with them) into <mark3>sublime:</mark3><br>
<br>
Lady Fitz-Frisky, and Miss M{ae}via <mark5>Mannish,</mark5><br>
Both long'd extremely to be sung in Spanish. <br>
However, he did pretty well, and <mark4>was</mark4><br>
Admitted as an aspirant to <mark4>all</mark4><br>
The coteries, and, as in Banquo's <mark1>glass,</mark1><br>
At great assemblies or in parties <mark3>small,</mark3><br>
He saw ten thousand living authors <mark1>pass,</mark1><br>
That being about their average <mark4>numeral;</mark4><br>
Also the eighty "greatest living <mark4>poets,"</mark4><br>
<br>
As every paltry magazine can show  it's <mark4>.</mark4><br>
In twice five years the "greatest living <mark4>poet,"</mark4><br>
Like to the champion in the fisty <mark4>ring,</mark4><br>
Is call'd on to support his claim, or show <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
Although 'tis an imaginary <mark3>thing,</mark3><br>
Even I--albeit I'm sure I did not know <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
Nor sought of foolscap subjects to be <mark3>king--</mark3><br>
Was reckon'd, a considerable <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
The grand Napoleon of the realms of <mark1>rhyme.</mark1><br>
<br>
But Juan was my Moscow, and Faliero <br>
My Leipsic, and my Mont Saint Jean seem <mark4>Cain:</mark4><br>
"La Belle Alliance" of dunces down at <mark4>zero,</mark4><br>
Now that the Lion's fall'n, may rise <mark3>again,</mark3><br>
But I will fall at least as fell my <mark3>hero;</mark3><br>
Nor reign at all, or as a  monarch <mark3>reign;</mark3><br>
Or to some lonely isle of jailors <mark3>go,</mark3><br>
With turncoat Southey for my turnkey <mark3>Lowe.</mark3><br>
Sir Walter reign'd before me; Moore and <mark4>Campbell</mark4><br>
<br>
Before and after; but now grown more <mark4>holy,</mark4><br>
The Muses upon Sion's hill must <mark3>ramble</mark3><br>
With poets almost clergymen, or <mark2>wholly;</mark2><br>
And Pegasus has a psalmodic <mark3>amble</mark3><br>
Beneath the very Reverend Rowley <mark4>Powley,</mark4><br>
Who shoes the glorious animal with <mark4>stilts,</mark4><br>
A modern Ancient Pistol--"by the <mark3>hilts!"</mark3><br>
Still he excels that artificial <mark4>hard</mark4><br>
Labourer in the same vineyard, though the <mark4>vine</mark4><br>
<br>
Yields him but vinegar for his <mark4>reward--</mark4><br>
That neutralis'd dull Dorus of the <mark3>Nine;</mark3><br>
That swarthy Sporus, neither man nor <mark4>bard;</mark4><br>
That ox of verse, who ploughs for every <mark3>line:</mark3><br>
Cambyses' roaring Romans beat at <mark4>least</mark4><br>
The howling Hebrews of Cybele's <mark3>priest.</mark3><br>
Then there's my gentle Euphues, who, they <mark1>say,</mark1><br>
Sets up for being a sort of moral <mark3>me;</mark3><br>
He'll find it rather difficult some <mark3>day</mark3><br>
<br>
To turn out both, or either, it may <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
Some persons think that Coleridge hath the <mark3>sway;</mark3><br>
And Wordsworth has supporters, two or <mark3>three;</mark3><br>
And that deep-mouth'd Boeotian "Savage <mark4>Landor"</mark4><br>
Has taken for a swan rogue Southey's <mark3>gander.</mark3><br>
John Keats, who was kill'd off by one <mark4>critique,</mark4><br>
Just as he really promis'd something <mark4>great,</mark4><br>
If not intelligible, without <mark3>Greek</mark3><br>
Contriv'd to talk about the gods of <mark3>late,</mark3><br>
<br>
Much as they might have been suppos'd to <mark3>speak.</mark3><br>
Poor fellow! His was an untoward <mark3>fate;</mark3><br>
'Tis strange the mind, that very fiery <mark4>particle,</mark4><br>
Should let itself be snuff'd out by an <mark3>article.</mark3><br>
The list grows long of live and dead <mark4>pretenders</mark4><br>
To that which none will gain--or none will <mark3>know</mark3><br>
The conqueror at least; who, ere Time <mark3>renders</mark3><br>
His last award, will have the long grass <mark3>grow</mark3><br>
Above his burnt-out brain, and sapless <mark4>cinders.</mark4><br>
<br>
If I might augur, I should rate but <mark3>low</mark3><br>
Their chances; they're too numerous, like the <mark5>thirty</mark5><br>
Mock tyrants, when Rome's annals wax'd but <mark4>dirty.</mark4><br>
This is the literary lower <mark4>empire,</mark4><br>
Where the pr{ae}torian bands take up the <mark1>matter;</mark1><br>
A "dreadful trade," like his who "gathers samphire," <br>
The insolent soldiery to soothe and <mark1>flatter,</mark1><br>
With the same feelings as you'd coax a <mark4>vampire,</mark4><br>
Now, were I once at home, and in good <mark4>satire,</mark4><br>
<br>
I'd try conclusions with those Janizaries, <br>
And show them what an intellectual war <mark1>is.</mark1><br>
I think I know a trick or two, would <mark1>turn</mark1><br>
Their flanks; but it is hardly worth my <mark4>while,</mark4><br>
With such small gear to give myself <mark3>concern:</mark3><br>
Indeed I've not the necessary <mark3>bile;</mark3><br>
My natural temper's really aught but <mark3>stern,</mark3><br>
And even my Muse's worst reproof's a <mark3>smile;</mark3><br>
And then she drops a brief and modern <mark4>curtsy,</mark4><br>
<br>
And glides away, assur'd she never hurts <mark3>ye.</mark3><br>
My Juan, whom I left in deadly <mark4>peril</mark4><br>
Amongst live poets and blue <mark4>ladies</mark4>, <mark4>pass'd</mark4><br>
With some small profit through that field so <mark3>sterile,</mark3><br>
Being tir'd in time, and, neither least nor <mark4>last,</mark4><br>
Left it before he had been treated very <mark1>ill;</mark1><br>
And henceforth found himself more gaily <mark3>class'd</mark3><br>
Amongst the higher spirits of the <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
The sun's true son, no vapour, but a <mark3>ray.</mark3><br>
<br>
His morns he pass'd in business--which <mark4>dissected,</mark4><br>
Was, like all business, a laborious <mark4>nothing</mark4><br>
That leads to lassitude, the most <mark4>infected</mark4><br>
And Centaur-Nessus garb of mortal <mark4>clothing,</mark4><br>
And on our sofas makes us lie <mark3>dejected,</mark3><br>
And talk in tender horrors of our <mark4>loathing</mark4><br>
All kinds of toil, save for our country's <mark4>good--</mark4><br>
Which grows no better, though 'tis time it <mark1>should.</mark1><br>
His afternoons he pass'd in visits, <mark4>luncheons,</mark4><br>
<br>
Lounging and boxing; and the twilight <mark4>hour</mark4><br>
In riding round those vegetable puncheons <br>
Call'd "Parks," where there is neither fruit nor <mark3>flower</mark3><br>
Enough to gratify a bee's slight munchings; <br>
But after all it is the only <mark3>"bower"</mark3><br>
(In Moore's phrase) where the fashionable <mark1>fair</mark1><br>
Can form a slight acquaintance with fresh <mark1>air.</mark1><br>
Then dress, then dinner, then awakes the <mark4>world!</mark4><br>
Then glare the lamps, then whirl the wheels, then <mark4>roar</mark4><br>
<br>
Through street and square fast flashing chariots <mark4>hurl'd</mark4><br>
Like harness'd meteors; then along the <mark3>floor</mark3><br>
Chalk mimics painting; then festoons are <mark3>twirl'd;</mark3><br>
Then roll the brazen thunders of the <mark1>door,</mark1><br>
Which opens to the thousand happy <mark3>few</mark3><br>
An earthly Paradise of "Or Molu." <br>
There stands the noble hostess, nor shall <mark4>sink</mark4><br>
With the three-thousandth curtsy; there the <mark4>waltz,</mark4><br>
The only dance which teaches girls to <mark3>think,</mark3><br>
<br>
Makes one in love even with its very <mark3>faults.</mark3><br>
Saloon, room, hall, o'erflow beyond their <mark3>brink,</mark3><br>
And long the latest of arrivals <mark3>halts,</mark3><br>
'Midst royal dukes and dames condemn'd to <mark3>climb,</mark3><br>
And gain an inch of staircase at a <mark1>time.</mark1><br>
Thrice happy he who, after a <mark3>survey</mark3><br>
Of the good company, can win a <mark4>corner,</mark4><br>
A door that's in or boudoir out of the <mark1>way,</mark1><br>
Where he may fix himself like small "Jack <mark3>Horner,"</mark3><br>
<br>
And let the Babel round run as it <mark3>may,</mark3><br>
And look on as a mourner, or a <mark5>scorner,</mark5><br>
Or an approver, or a mere <mark4>spectator,</mark4><br>
Yawning a little as the night grows <mark4>later.</mark4><br>
But this won't do, save by and by; and <mark1>he</mark1><br>
Who, like Don Juan, takes an active <mark4>share</mark4><br>
Must steer with care through all that glittering <mark1>sea</mark1><br>
Of gems and plumes and pearls and silks, to <mark3>where</mark3><br>
He deems it is his proper place to <mark1>be;</mark1><br>
<br>
Dissolving in the waltz to some soft <mark1>air,</mark1><br>
Or proudlier prancing with mercurial <mark3>skill,</mark3><br>
Where Science marshals forth her own quadrille. <br>
Or, if he dance not, but hath higher <mark4>views</mark4><br>
Upon an heiress or his neighbour's <mark1>bride,</mark1><br>
Let him take care that that which he <mark3>pursues</mark3><br>
       Is not at once too palpably descried. <br>
Full many an eager gentleman oft rues <br>
His haste; impatience is a blundering <mark3>guide</mark3><br>
<br>
Amongst a people famous for <mark4>reflection,</mark4><br>
Who like to play the fool with <mark3>circumspection.</mark3><br>
But, if you can contrive, get next at <mark4>supper;</mark4><br>
Or, if forestalled, get opposite and <mark4>ogle:</mark4><br>
Oh, ye ambrosial moments! always <mark3>upper</mark3><br>
In mind, a sort of sentimental <mark3>bogle,</mark3><br>
Which sits for ever upon Memory's crupper, <br>
The ghost of vanish'd pleasures once in vogue! <mark1>Ill</mark1><br>
Can tender souls relate the rise and <mark4>fall</mark4><br>
<br>
Of hopes and fears which shake a single <mark3>ball.</mark3><br>
But these precautionary hints can <mark4>touch</mark4><br>
Only the common run, who must <mark3>pursue,</mark3><br>
And watch and ward; whose plans a word too <mark3>much</mark3><br>
Or little overturns; and not the <mark1>few</mark1><br>
Or many (for the number's sometimes <mark3>such)</mark3><br>
Whom a good mien, especially if <mark3>new,</mark3><br>
Or fame, or name, for wit, war, sense or <mark4>nonsense,</mark4><br>
Permits whate'er they please, or did not long <mark4>since.</mark4><br>
<br>
Our hero, as a hero young and <mark4>handsome,</mark4><br>
Noble, rich, celebrated, and a <mark4>stranger,</mark4><br>
Like other slaves of course must pay his <mark3>ransom</mark3><br>
Before he can escape from so much <mark3>danger</mark3><br>
As will environ a conspicuous man. <mark4>Some</mark4><br>
Talk about poetry, and "rack and <mark3>manger,"</mark3><br>
And ugliness, disease, as toil and <mark1>trouble--</mark1><br>
I wish they knew the life of a young <mark4>noble.</mark4><br>
They are young, but know not youth--it is <mark4>anticipated;</mark4><br>
<br>
       Handsome but wasted, rich without a sou; <br>
Their vigour in a thousand arms is <mark3>dissipated;</mark3><br>
Their cash comes from, their wealth goes to a <mark3>Jew;</mark3><br>
Both senates see their nightly votes <mark3>participated</mark3><br>
Between the tyrant's and the tribunes' <mark3>crew;</mark3><br>
And having voted, din'd, drunk, gam'd and <mark5>whor'd,</mark5><br>
The family vault receives another <mark4>lord.</mark4><br>
"Where is the World," cries Young, "at eighty? <mark1>Where</mark1><br>
The World in which a man was born?" <mark4>Alas!</mark4><br>
<br>
Where is the world of eight years past? 'Twas <mark1>there--</mark1><br>
I look for it--'tis gone, a Globe of <mark1>Glass!</mark1><br>
Crack'd, shiver'd, vanish'd, scarcely gaz'd on, <mark3>ere</mark3><br>
A silent change dissolves the glittering <mark3>mass.</mark3><br>
Statesmen, chiefs, orators, queens, patriots, <mark1>kings,</mark1><br>
And dandies--all are gone on the wind's <mark3>wings.</mark3><br>
Where is Napoleon the Grand? God <mark4>knows:</mark4><br>
Where little Castlereagh? The devil can <mark1>tell:</mark1><br>
Where Grattan, Curran, Sheridan, all <mark3>those</mark3><br>
<br>
Who bound the Bar or Senate in their <mark1>spell?</mark1><br>
Where is the unhappy Queen, with all her <mark3>woes?</mark3><br>
And where the Daughter, whom the Isles lov'd <mark1>well?</mark1><br>
Where are those martyr'd saints the Five per <mark4>Cents?</mark4><br>
And where--oh, where the devil are the <mark3>Rents?</mark3><br>
Where's Brummell? Dish'd. Where's Long Pole Wellesley? <mark1>Diddled.</mark1><br>
Where's Whitbread? Romilly? Where's George the <mark4>Third?</mark4><br>
Where is his will? (That's not so soon unriddled.) <br>
And where is "Fum" the Fourth, our "royal <mark3>bird"?</mark3><br>
<br>
Gone down, it seems, to Scotland to be <mark4>fiddled</mark4><br>
Unto by Sawney's violin, we have <mark1>heard:</mark1><br>
"Caw me, caw thee"--for six months hath been <mark4>hatching</mark4><br>
This scene of royal itch and loyal <mark3>scratching.</mark3><br>
Where is Lord This? And where my Lady <mark1>That?</mark1><br>
The Honourable Mistresses and <mark1>Misses?</mark1><br>
Some laid aside like an old Opera <mark3>hat,</mark3><br>
Married, unmarried, and remarried (this <mark1>is</mark1><br>
An evolution oft perform'd of <mark1>late).</mark1><br>
<br>
Where are the Dublin shouts--and London <mark3>hisses?</mark3><br>
Where are the Grenvilles? Turn'd as usual. <mark1>Where</mark1><br>
My friends the Whigs? Exactly where they were. <br>
Where are the Lady Carolines and Franceses? <br>
Divorc'd or doing thereanent. Ye <mark4>annals</mark4><br>
So brilliant, where the list of routs and dances <mark1>is,</mark1><br>
Thou Morning Post, sole record of the <mark4>panels</mark4><br>
Broken in carriages, and all the phantasies <br>
Of fashion, say what streams now fill those <mark3>channels?</mark3><br>
<br>
Some die, some fly, some languish on the <mark4>Continent,</mark4><br>
Because the times have hardly left them one <mark4>tenant.</mark4><br>
Some who once set their caps at cautious <mark4>dukes,</mark4><br>
Have taken up at length with younger <mark1>brothers:</mark1><br>
Some heiresses have bit at sharpers' <mark4>hooks:</mark4><br>
Some maids have been made <mark4>wives</mark4>, some merely <mark1>mothers:</mark1><br>
Others have lost their fresh and fairy <mark3>looks:</mark3><br>
In short, the list of alterations <mark4>bothers.</mark4><br>
There's little strange in this, but something strange <mark1>is</mark1><br>
<br>
The unusual quickness of these common <mark3>changes.</mark3><br>
Talk not of seventy years as age! in <mark4>seven</mark4><br>
I have seen more changes, down from monarchs <mark3>to</mark3><br>
The humblest individuals under <mark3>heaven,</mark3><br>
Than might suffice a moderate century <mark3>through.</mark3><br>
I knew that nought was lasting, but now <mark4>even</mark4><br>
Change grows too changeable, without being <mark1>new:</mark1><br>
Nought's permanent among the human <mark4>race,</mark4><br>
Except the Whigs not getting into <mark1>place.</mark1><br>
<br>
I have seen Napoleon, who seem'd quite a <mark4>Jupiter,</mark4><br>
Shrink to a Saturn. I have seen a <mark4>Duke</mark4><br>
(No matter which) turn politician <mark4>stupider,</mark4><br>
If that can well be, than his wooden <mark1>look.</mark1><br>
But it is time that I should hoist my "blue <mark4>Peter,"</mark4><br>
And sail for a new theme: I have seen--and <mark3>shook</mark3><br>
To see it--the King <mark4>hiss'd</mark4>, and then <mark4>caress'd;</mark4><br>
But don't pretend to settle which was <mark4>best.</mark4><br>
I have seen the Landholders without a <mark3>rap--</mark3><br>
<br>
I have seen Joanna Southcote--I have <mark4>seen</mark4><br>
The House of Commons turn'd to a taxtrap-- <br>
I have seen that sad affair of the late <mark3>Queen--</mark3><br>
I have seen crowns worn instead of a fool's <mark3>cap--</mark3><br>
I have seen a Congress doing all that's <mark3>mean--</mark3><br>
I have seen some <mark4>nations</mark4>, like o'erloaded <mark4>asses,</mark4><br>
Kick off their burthens--meaning the high <mark3>classes.</mark3><br>
I have seen small poets, and great prosers, <mark4>and</mark4><br>
       Interminable--not eternal--speakers-- <br>
<br>
I have seen the funds at war with house and <mark3>land--</mark3><br>
I have seen the country gentlemen turn <mark4>squeakers--</mark4><br>
I have seen the people ridden o'er like <mark3>sand</mark3><br>
By slaves on horseback--I have seen malt <mark4>liquors</mark4><br>
Exchang'd for "thin potations" by John <mark4>Bull--</mark4><br>
I have seen John half detect himself a <mark4>fool.</mark4><br>
But "carpe diem," Juan, "carpe, <mark5>carpe!"</mark5><br>
To-morrow sees another race as <mark3>gay</mark3><br>
And transient, and devour'd by the same <mark5>harpy.</mark5><br>
<br>
"Life's a poor player"--then "play out the <mark3>play,</mark3><br>
Ye villains!" and above all keep a sharp <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
Much less on what you do than what you <mark1>say:</mark1><br>
Be hypocritical, be cautious, <mark1>be</mark1><br>
Not what you seem, but always what you <mark3>see.</mark3><br>
But how shall I relate in other <mark5>cantos</mark5><br>
Of what befell our hero in the <mark1>land,</mark1><br>
Which 'tis the common cry and lie to vaunt <mark4>as</mark4><br>
A moral country? But I hold my <mark3>hand--</mark3><br>
<br>
For I disdain to write an Atalantis; <br>
But 'tis as well at once to <mark3>understand,</mark3><br>
You are not a moral people, and you know <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
Without the aid of too sincere a <mark1>poet.</mark1><br>
What Juan saw and underwent shall <mark1>be</mark1><br>
My topic, with of course the due <mark4>restriction</mark4><br>
Which is requir'd by proper <mark4>courtesy;</mark4><br>
And recollect the work is only <mark3>fiction,</mark3><br>
And that I sing of neither mine nor <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
<br>
Though every scribe, in some slight turn of <mark3>diction,</mark3><br>
Will hint allusions never <mark4>meant</mark4>, Ne'er <mark4>doubt</mark4><br>
This--when I speak, I don't <mark4>hint</mark4>, but speak <mark3>out.</mark3><br>
Whether he married with the third or <mark4>fourth</mark4><br>
Offspring of some sage husband-hunting <mark4>countess,</mark4><br>
Or whether with some virgin of more <mark4>worth</mark4><br>
(I mean in Fortune's matrimonial <mark4>bounties),</mark4><br>
He took to regularly peopling <mark3>Earth,</mark3><br>
Of which your lawful, awful wedlock fount <mark1>is--</mark1><br>
<br>
Or whether he was taken in for <mark3>damages,</mark3><br>
For being too excursive in his <mark4>homages--</mark4><br>
Is yet within the unread events of <mark1>time.</mark1><br>
Thus far, go forth, thou Lay, which I will <mark4>back</mark4><br>
Against the same given quantity of <mark1>rhyme,</mark1><br>
For being as much the subject of <mark3>attack</mark3><br>
As ever yet was any work <mark1>sublime,</mark1><br>
By those who love to say that white is <mark3>black.</mark3><br>
