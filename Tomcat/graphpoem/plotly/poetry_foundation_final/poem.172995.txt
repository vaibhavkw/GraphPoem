Title : Sonnets from the Portuguese 26: I lived with visions for my company <br>
Author : Elizabeth Barrett Browning <br><br>

I lived with visions for my company, <br>
Instead of men and women, years <mark3>ago,</mark3><br>
And found them gentle mates, nor thought to <mark3>know</mark3><br>
A sweeter music than they played to <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
But soon their trailing purple was not <mark3>free</mark3><br>
Of this world's dust, -- their lutes did silent <mark3>grow,</mark3><br>
And I myself grew faint and blind <mark3>below</mark3><br>
Their vanishing eyes. Then THOU didst come ... to <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
Beloved, what they seemed. Their shining <mark4>fronts,</mark4><br>
Their songs, their splendours, (better, yet the <mark3>same,</mark3><br>
As river-water hallowed into <mark4>fonts)</mark4><br>
Met in thee, and from out thee <mark3>overcame</mark3><br>
My soul with satisfaction of all wants <mark3>--</mark3><br>
Because God's gifts put man's best dreams to <mark3>shame.</mark3><br>
