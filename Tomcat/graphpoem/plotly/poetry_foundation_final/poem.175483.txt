Title : Superfly <br>
Author : Lynn Crosbie <br><br>

Make your mind what you want it to be. --Curtis <mark4>Mayfield</mark4><br>
Tired of waiting for him, I think of a plan to stick it to <mark4>the</mark4><br>
Man--he waylaid me with promises: protection, his valuable <mark4>keys.</mark4><br>
Nights of seduction, I would glide to the curb in my customized Eldorado, <br>
black finish and cool bubble top <br>
<br>
and turn it over to a superyoung girl with rags and a bucket of <mark4>soapy</mark4><br>
water, with a smile and a dead president, make it shine my <mark4>sister.</mark4><br>
He is inside listening to Curtis, his sapphire ring <br>
<br>
he brings the moon with him, this cat, and his eyes glow like <br>
mellow stones at my superfly threads. The cashmere white stitched suit, <br>
the maxi coat trimmed in fox fur: vixen, <br>
<br>
my pretty little hat with three blue feather plumes. I let him dig me for a <mark4>while,</mark4><br>
and lay a kiss, a spoon of cocaine on him, our secret <mark4>meetings</mark4><br>
a potent rush and I am hip to the hit to his fly hand on my thigh, <br>
<br>
my ladies scatter in a cloud of Opium and he tells <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
you know me, I'm your <mark4>friend.</mark4><br>
<br>
I thought he was my man--I flash on him in the bathtub, its ledge of oils in <mark4>flasks,</mark4><br>
pulling a loofah sponge over my tired shoulders, passing a reefer in lemon <mark4>paper,</mark4><br>
<br>
on all the tired bitches working his keys, hustling his diamond <mark4>rocks--</mark4><br>
two sets of false eyelashes, micro minis, freezing their asses off. <br>
<br>
My .25 Beretta can't stop him, it's not real, I'm not real to him. <mark4>He'll</mark4><br>
use me up and kill me; I need brains guts and <mark4>cool;</mark4><br>
I put fur on your back, my baby, he <mark4>says.</mark4><br>
<br>
I am between him and death, the greatest high of all, and I ask him to step <mark4>outside.</mark4><br>
The pink flakes blow my mind and I turn to him with a flurry of karate <mark4>kicks,</mark4><br>
kicking out my left leg I bring him to the <mark4>ground</mark4><br>
<br>
and with my foot on the collar of his mohair suit I tell him, I took <mark4>your</mark4><br>
money and signed a contract on you: I hired the best killers there <mark4>are--</mark4><br>
<br>
men like you--yeah, if one hair on my gorgeous head is harmed, it's all over for <mark5>you.</mark5><br>
It's all over for you, I think, as I imagine I am Superfly; my mind is what I want it to <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
the Man is tired and suddenly he <mark4>looks</mark4><br>
<br>
old, very, very old as he turns away from me, the things he cannot dream-- <br>
my brazen plans, my body full of love.<br>
