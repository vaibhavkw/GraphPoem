Title : The Debt <br>
Author : Paul Laurence Dunbar <br><br>

This is the debt I <mark3>pay</mark3><br>
Just for one riotous <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
Years of regret and <mark3>grief,</mark3><br>
Sorrow without <mark3>relief.</mark3><br>
<br>
Pay it I will to the end <mark3>?</mark3><br>
Until the grave, my <mark3>friend,</mark3><br>
Gives me a true release <mark5>?</mark5><br>
Gives me the clasp of <mark3>peace.</mark3><br>
<br>
Slight was the thing I <mark3>bought,</mark3><br>
Small was the debt I <mark3>thought,</mark3><br>
Poor was the loan at best <mark4>?</mark4><br>
God! but the <mark4>interest!</mark4><br>
