Title : Introduction to the Songs of Innocence <br>
Author : William Blake <br><br>

Piping down the valleys <mark3>wild</mark3><br>
Piping songs of pleasant <mark3>glee</mark3><br>
On a cloud I saw a <mark3>child.</mark3><br>
And he laughing said to <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
<br>
Pipe a song about a Lamb; <br>
So I piped with merry <mark1>chear,</mark1><br>
Piper pipe that song <mark1>again--</mark1><br>
So I piped, he wept to <mark1>hear.</mark1><br>
<br>
Drop thy pipe thy happy pipe <br>
Sing thy songs of happy <mark1>chear,</mark1><br>
So I sung the same <mark1>again</mark1><br>
While he wept with joy to <mark1>hear</mark1><br>
<br>
Piper sit thee down and <mark3>write</mark3><br>
In a book that all may <mark4>read--</mark4><br>
So he vanish'd from my <mark3>sight.</mark3><br>
And I pluck'd a hollow <mark2>reed.</mark2><br>
<br>
And I made a rural <mark3>pen,</mark3><br>
And I stain'd the water <mark4>clear,</mark4><br>
And I wrote my happy songs <br>
Every child may joy to <mark1>hear</mark1><br>
