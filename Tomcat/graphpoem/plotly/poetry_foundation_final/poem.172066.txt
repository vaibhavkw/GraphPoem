Title : A Dialogue of Self and Soul <br>
Author : William Butler Yeats <br><br>

<br>
My Soul. I summon to the winding ancient <mark3>stair;</mark3><br>
Set all your mind upon the steep <mark4>ascent,</mark4><br>
Upon the broken, crumbling <mark4>battlement,</mark4><br>
Upon the breathless starlit <mark3>air,</mark3><br>
Upon the star that marks the hidden <mark3>pole;</mark3><br>
Fix every wandering thought <mark4>upon</mark4><br>
That quarter where all thought is <mark4>done:</mark4><br>
Who can distinguish darkness from the <mark3>soul?</mark3><br>
My Self. The consecrated blade upon my <mark4>knees</mark4><br>
<br>
Is Sato's ancient blade, still as it <mark4>was,</mark4><br>
Still razor-keen, still like a <mark4>looking-glass</mark4><br>
Unspotted by the <mark4>centuries;</mark4><br>
That flowering, silken, old embroidery, <mark4>torn</mark4><br>
From some court-lady's dress and <mark3>round</mark3><br>
The wooden scabbard bound and <mark3>wound,</mark3><br>
Can, tattered, still protect, faded <mark3>adorn.</mark3><br>
My Soul. Why should the imagination of a <mark4>man</mark4><br>
<br>
Long past his prime remember things that <mark4>are</mark4><br>
Emblematical of love and <mark4>war?</mark4><br>
Think of ancestral night that <mark3>can,</mark3><br>
If but imagination scorn the <mark3>earth</mark3><br>
And intellect its <mark4>wandering</mark4><br>
To this and that and t'other <mark4>thing,</mark4><br>
Deliver from the crime of death and <mark3>birth.</mark3><br>
My Self. Montashigi, third of his family, fashioned <mark4>it</mark4><br>
<br>
   Five hundred years ago, about it lie <br>
   Flowers from I know not what embroidery-- <br>
Heart's purple--and all these I <mark4>set</mark4><br>
For emblems of the day against the <mark3>tower</mark3><br>
Emblematical of the <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
And claim as by a soldier's <mark3>right</mark3><br>
A charter to commit the crime once <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
My Soul. Such fullness in that quarter <mark4>overflows</mark4><br>
<br>
And falls into the basin of the <mark4>mind</mark4><br>
That man is stricken deaf and dumb and <mark3>blind,</mark3><br>
For intellect no longer <mark4>knows</mark4><br>
Is from the Ought, or Knower from the <mark4>Known--</mark4><br>
That is to say, ascends to <mark4>Heaven;</mark4><br>
Only the dead can be <mark4>forgiven;</mark4><br>
But when I think of that my tongue's a <mark4>stone.</mark4><br>
My Self. A living man is blind and drinks his <mark4>drop.</mark4><br>
<br>
What matter if the ditches are <mark4>impure?</mark4><br>
<br>
What matter if I live it all once <mark1>more?</mark1><br>
Endure that toil of growing <mark4>up;</mark4><br>
The ignominy of boyhood; the <mark4>distress</mark4><br>
Of boyhood changing into <mark1>man;</mark1><br>
The unfinished man and his <mark4>pain</mark4><br>
Brought face to face with his own <mark4>clumsiness;</mark4><br>
The finished man among his <mark4>enemies?--</mark4><br>
How in the name of Heaven can he <mark4>escape</mark4><br>
That defiling and disfigured <mark3>shape</mark3><br>
<br>
The mirror of malicious <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
Casts upon his eyes until at <mark4>last</mark4><br>
He thinks that shape must be his <mark1>shape?</mark1><br>
And what's the good of an <mark1>escape</mark1><br>
If honour find him in the wintry <mark3>blast?</mark3><br>
I am content to live it all <mark3>again</mark3><br>
And yet again, if it be life to <mark3>pitch</mark3><br>
Into the frog-spawn of a blind man's <mark3>ditch,</mark3><br>
<br>
A blind man battering blind <mark3>men;</mark3><br>
Or into that most fecund ditch of <mark4>all,</mark4><br>
The folly that man <mark4>does</mark4><br>
Or must suffer, if he <mark4>woos</mark4><br>
A proud woman not kindred of his <mark1>soul.</mark1><br>
I am content to follow to its <mark4>source</mark4><br>
Every event in action or in <mark4>thought;</mark4><br>
Measure the <mark1>lot</mark1>, forgive myself the <mark3>lot!</mark3><br>
<br>
When such as I cast out <mark3>remorse</mark3><br>
So great a sweetness flows into the <mark4>breast</mark4><br>
We must laugh and we must <mark3>sing,</mark3><br>
We are blest by <mark4>everything,</mark4><br>
Everything we look upon is <mark3>blest.</mark3><br>
