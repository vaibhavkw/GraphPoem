Title : The Dome of Sunday <br>
Author : Karl Shapiro <br><br>

With focus sharp as Flemish-painted <mark4>face</mark4><br>
In film of varnish brightly <mark4>fixed</mark4><br>
And through a polished hand-lens deeply <mark3>seen,</mark3><br>
Sunday at noon through hyaline thin <mark3>air</mark3><br>
Sees down the <mark4>street,</mark4><br>
And in the camera of my eye <mark4>depicts</mark4><br>
Row-houses and <mark4>row-lives:</mark4><br>
Glass after glass, door after door the <mark1>same,</mark1><br>
Face after face the <mark1>same</mark1>, the <mark1>same,</mark1><br>
The brutal visibility the <mark1>same;</mark1><br>
<br>
As if one life emerging from one <mark4>house</mark4><br>
Would pause, a single image caught <mark3>between</mark3><br>
Two facing mirrors where vision <mark4>multiplies</mark4><br>
Beyond <mark4>perspective,</mark4><br>
A silent clatter in the high-speed eye <br>
Spinning out photo-circulars of <mark4>sight.</mark4><br>
<br>
I see slip to the curb the long <mark4>machines</mark4><br>
Out of whose warm and windowed rooms pirouette <br>
Shellacked with silk and <mark3>light</mark3><br>
The hard legs of our <mark4>women.</mark4><br>
Our women are one woman, dressed in <mark3>black.</mark3><br>
The carmine printed mouth<br>
And cheeks as soft as muslin-glass belong<br>
Outright to one dark dressy <mark4>man,</mark4><br>
Merely a swagger at her curvy side.<br>
This is their visit to <mark4>themselves:</mark4><br>
All day from porch to porch they <mark4>weave</mark4><br>
A nonsense pattern through the even <mark3>glare,</mark3><br>
Stealing in <mark4>surfaces</mark4><br>
Cold vulgar glances at <mark1>themselves.</mark1><br>
<br>
And high up in the heated room all day<br>
I wait behind the plate glass pane for <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
Hot as a voyeur for a glimpse of <mark1>one,</mark1><br>
The vision to blot out this woman's <mark4>sheen;</mark4><br>
All day my sight records expensively <br>
Row-houses and <mark1>row-lives.</mark1><br>
<br>
But nothing happens; no <mark4>diagonal</mark4><br>
With melting shadow falls across the <mark4>curb:</mark4><br>
Neither the blinded negress lurching through fatigue, <br>
Nor exiles bleeding from their <mark4>pores,</mark4><br>
Nor that bright bomb slipped lightly from its <mark3>rack</mark3><br>
To splinter every silvered glass and crystal <mark4>prism,</mark4><br>
Witch-bowl and perfume <mark4>bottle</mark4><br>
And billion candle-power <mark4>dressing-bulb,</mark4><br>
No direct hit to smash the shatter-proof <br>
And lodge at last the quivering <mark4>needle</mark4><br>
Clean in the eye of one who stands <mark4>transfixed</mark4><br>
In fascination of her <mark4>brightness.</mark4><br>
