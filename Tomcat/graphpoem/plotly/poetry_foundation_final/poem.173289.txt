Title : The Shrubbery <br>
Author : William Cowper <br><br>

   Oh happy shades?to me unblest!<br>
Friendly to peace, but not to <mark3>me!</mark3><br>
How ill the scene that offers <mark4>rest,</mark4><br>
And heart that cannot rest, <mark3>agree!</mark3><br>
<br>
This glassy stream, that spreading <mark3>pine,</mark3><br>
Those alders quiv'ring to the <mark3>breeze,</mark3><br>
Might sooth a soul less hurt than <mark3>mine,</mark3><br>
And <mark1>please</mark1>, if any thing could <mark3>please.</mark3><br>
<br>
   But fix'd unalterable care<br>
Foregoes not what she feels <mark4>within,</mark4><br>
Shows the same sadness <mark4>ev'rywhere,</mark4><br>
And slights the season and the <mark4>scene.</mark4><br>
<br>
For all that pleas'd in wood or <mark4>lawn,</mark4><br>
While peace possess'd these silent <mark4>bow'rs,</mark4><br>
Her animating smile <mark3>withdrawn,</mark3><br>
Has lost its beauties and its <mark3>pow'rs.</mark3><br>
<br>
The saint or moralist should <mark4>tread</mark4><br>
This moss-grown alley, musing, <mark3>slow;</mark3><br>
They seek, like me, the secret <mark4>shade,</mark4><br>
But not, like me, to nourish <mark3>woe!</mark3><br>
<br>
Me fruitful scenes and prospects <mark4>waste</mark4><br>
Alike admonish not to <mark4>roam;</mark4><br>
These tell me of enjoyments <mark4>past,</mark4><br>
And those of sorrows yet to <mark4>come.</mark4><br>
