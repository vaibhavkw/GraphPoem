Title : Sonnet 15: When I consider everything that grows <br>
Author : William Shakespeare <br><br>

When I consider everything that <mark3>grows</mark3><br>
Holds in perfection but a little <mark4>moment,</mark4><br>
That this huge stage presenteth nought but <mark3>shows</mark3><br>
Whereon the stars in secret influence <mark4>comment;</mark4><br>
When I perceive that men as plants <mark3>increase,</mark3><br>
Cheered and check'd even by the selfsame sky, <br>
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height <mark3>decrease,</mark3><br>
And wear their brave state out of memory; <br>
Then the conceit of this inconstant <mark3>stay</mark3><br>
Sets you most rich in youth before my <mark4>sight,</mark4><br>
Where wasteful Time debateth with <mark3>Decay</mark3><br>
To change your day of youth to sullied <mark3>night;</mark3><br>
And all in war with Time for love of <mark3>you,</mark3><br>
As he takes from <mark3>you</mark3>, I engraft you <mark3>new.</mark3><br>
