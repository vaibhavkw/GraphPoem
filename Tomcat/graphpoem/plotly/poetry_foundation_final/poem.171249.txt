Title : Nothing But Color <br>
Author : Ai <br><br>

for Yukio Mishima<br>
I didn't write Etsuko,   <br>
I sliced her <mark1>open.</mark1><br>
She was carmine <mark4>inside</mark4><br>
like a sea <mark4>bass</mark4><br>
and <mark4>empty.</mark4><br>
No viscera, nothing but <mark4>color.</mark4><br>
I love you like that, <mark1>boy.</mark1><br>
I pull the kimono down around your <mark4>shoulders</mark4><br>
and kiss <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
Then you let it fall <mark1>open.</mark1><br>
Each time, I cut you a <mark4>little</mark4><br>
and when you leave, I take the <mark4>piece,</mark4><br>
broil it, dip it in ginger <mark4>sauce</mark4><br>
and eat it. It burns my mouth so. <br>
You laugh, holding me <mark4>belly-down</mark4><br>
with your <mark4>body.</mark4><br>
So much hurting to get to this <mark4>moment,</mark4><br>
when I'm beneath <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
wanting it to go on and to <mark4>end.</mark4><br>
<br>
At <mark4>midnight</mark4>, you say see you <mark4>tonight</mark4><br>
and I answer there won't be any <mark1>tonight,</mark1><br>
but you just smile, swing your <mark4>sweater</mark4><br>
over your head and tie the sleeves around your <mark4>neck.</mark4><br>
I hear you whistling long after you disappear   <br>
down the subway <mark4>steps,</mark4><br>
as I walk back home, my whole body tingling. <br>
I <mark4>undress</mark4><br>
and put the bronze sword on my <mark4>desk</mark4><br>
beside the crumpled sheet of rice <mark4>paper.</mark4><br>
I smooth it <mark1>open</mark1><br>
and read its single <mark4>sentence:</mark4><br>
I meant to do <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
No. It should be common and <mark4>feminine</mark4><br>
like I can't go on sharing <mark4>him,</mark4><br>
or something to imply <mark4>that.</mark4><br>
Or the <mark4>truth:</mark4><br>
that I saw in <mark1>myself</mark1><br>
the five signs of the decay of the <mark4>angel</mark4><br>
and you were holding on, watching and <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
that I decided to go <mark4>out</mark4><br>
with the pungent <mark4>odor</mark4><br>
of this cold and consuming passion in my nose: <mark4>death.</mark4><br>
Now, I've said it. That vulgar <mark4>word</mark4><br>
that drags us down to the worms, sightless, <mark4>predestined.</mark4><br>
Goddamn you, <mark1>boy.</mark1><br>
Nothing I said mattered to <mark1>you;</mark1><br>
that bullshit about Etsuko or about killing <mark1>myself.</mark1><br>
I tear the <mark4>note</mark4>, then burn <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
The alarm clock goes off. 5:45 <mark4>A.M.</mark4><br>
I take the sword and walk into the <mark4>garden.</mark4><br>
I look up. The <mark4>sun</mark4>, the <mark4>moon,</mark4><br>
two round teeth rock <mark4>together</mark4><br>
and the light of one chews up the <mark4>other.</mark4><br>
I stab myself in the <mark4>belly,</mark4><br>
wait, then stab myself <mark1>again</mark1>, <mark4>Again.</mark4><br>
It's snowing. I'll turn to <mark4>ice,</mark4><br>
but I'll burn anyone who touches <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
I start pulling my guts <mark1>out,</mark1><br>
those red silk <mark4>cords,</mark4><br>
spiraling <mark4>skyward,</mark4><br>
and I'm climbing <mark3>them</mark3><br>
past the moon and the <mark4>sun,</mark4><br>
past <mark4>darkness</mark4><br>
into <mark4>white.</mark4><br>
I mean to live.<br>
