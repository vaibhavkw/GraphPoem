Title : Luciferin <br>
Author : Dean Young <br><br>

"They won't attack us here in the Indian <mark4>graveyard."</mark4><br>
I love that <mark1>moment</mark1>, And I love the <mark1>moment</mark1><br>
when I climb into your warm you-smelling <br>
bed-dent after you've risen. And <mark4>sunflowers,</mark4><br>
once a whole field and I almost <mark4>crashed,</mark4><br>
the next year all pumpkins! Crop rotation, <br>
I love you. Dividing words between syl- <br>
lables! Dachshunds! What am I but the inter- <br>
section of these loves? I spend 35 dollars on a <mark3>CD</mark3><br>
of some guy with 15 different guitars in his <mark4>shack</mark4><br>
with lots of tape delays and loops, a good buy! <br>
Mexican animal crackers! But only to be <mark4>identified</mark4><br>
by what you love is a malformation just <mark4>as</mark4><br>
embryonic chickens grow very strange in zero <br>
gravity. I hate those experiments on <mark4>animals,</mark4><br>
varnished bats, blinded rabbits, <mark4>cows</mark4><br>
with windows in their flanks but <mark4>obviously</mark4><br>
I'm fascinated. Perhaps it was my early <mark4>exposure</mark4><br>
to Frankenstein. I love Frankenstein! Arrgh, <br>
he replies to everything, fire <mark4>particularly</mark4><br>
sets him off, something the villagers <mark4>quickly</mark4><br>
pick up. Fucking <mark4>villagers</mark4>, All their <mark4>shouting's</mark4><br>
making conversation impossible and <mark3>now</mark3><br>
there's grit in my lettuce which I <mark4>hate</mark4><br>
but kinda like in clams as one bespeaks <br>
poor hygiene and the other the <mark3>sea.</mark3><br>
I hate what we're doing to the <mark1>sea,</mark1><br>
dragging huge chains across the bottom, <br>
bleaching reefs. Either you're a <mark4>rubber/</mark4><br>
gasoline salesman or like me, you'd <mark4>like</mark4><br>
to duct tape the vice president's mouth <br>
to the exhaust pipe of an SUV and I <mark1>hate</mark1><br>
feeling like <mark4>that</mark4>, I would rather <mark4>concentrate</mark4><br>
on the rapidity of your ideograms, <mark3>how</mark3><br>
only a biochemical or two keeps <mark3>me</mark3><br>
from becoming the world's biggest lightning bug.<br>
