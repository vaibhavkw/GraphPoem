I joy, dear mother, when I <mark3>view</mark3><br>
Thy perfect lineaments, and <mark3>hue</mark3><br>
Both sweet and <mark3>bright.</mark3><br>
Beauty in thee takes up her <mark3>place,</mark3><br>
And dates her letters from thy <mark3>face,</mark3><br>
When she doth <mark3>write.</mark3><br>
<br>
A fine aspect in fit <mark3>array,</mark3><br>
Neither too mean nor yet too <mark3>gay,</mark3><br>
Shows who is <mark4>best.</mark4><br>
Outlandish looks may not <mark4>compare,</mark4><br>
For all they either painted <mark4>are,</mark4><br>
Or else <mark4>undress'd.</mark4><br>
<br>
She on the hills which <mark4>wantonly</mark4><br>
Allureth all, in hope to <mark4>be</mark4><br>
      By her preferr'd,<br>
Hath kiss'd so long her painted <mark4>shrines,</mark4><br>
That ev'n her face by kissing <mark3>shines,</mark3><br>
For her <mark4>reward.</mark4><br>
<br>
She in the valley is so <mark3>shy</mark3><br>
Of dressing, that her hair doth <mark3>lie</mark3><br>
About her <mark4>ears;</mark4><br>
While she avoids her neighbour's <mark4>pride,</mark4><br>
She wholly goes on th' other <mark3>side,</mark3><br>
And nothing <mark4>wears.</mark4><br>
<br>
But, dearest mother, what those <mark4>miss,</mark4><br>
The mean, thy praise and glory <mark4>is</mark4><br>
And long may <mark1>be.</mark1><br>
Blessed be God, whose love it <mark4>was</mark4><br>
To double-moat thee with his <mark4>grace,</mark4><br>
And none but <mark3>thee.</mark3><br>
