Title : Elegiac Stanzas Suggested <br>
Author : a Picture of Peele Castle in a Storm, Painted <br><br>

I was thy neighbour once, thou rugged <mark3>Pile!</mark3><br>
Four summer weeks I dwelt in sight of <mark3>thee:</mark3><br>
I saw thee every day; and all the <mark3>while</mark3><br>
Thy Form was sleeping on a glassy <mark3>sea.</mark3><br>
<br>
So pure the sky, so quiet was the <mark3>air!</mark3><br>
So like, so very like, was day to <mark3>day!</mark3><br>
Whene'er I looked, thy Image still was <mark3>there;</mark3><br>
It trembled, but it never passed <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
<br>
How perfect was the calm! it seemed no <mark3>sleep;</mark3><br>
No mood, which season takes away, or <mark3>brings:</mark3><br>
I could have fancied that the mighty <mark3>Deep</mark3><br>
Was even the gentlest of all gentle <mark3>things.</mark3><br>
<br>
Ah!  then , if mine had been the Painter's <mark3>hand,</mark3><br>
To express what then I saw; and add the <mark3>gleam,</mark3><br>
The light that never was, on sea or <mark3>land,</mark3><br>
The consecration, and the Poet's <mark3>dream;</mark3><br>
<br>
I would have planted thee, thou hoary <mark1>Pile</mark1><br>
Amid a world how different from <mark5>this!</mark5><br>
Beside a sea that could not cease to <mark3>smile;</mark3><br>
On tranquil land, beneath a sky of <mark3>bliss.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thou shouldst have seemed a treasure-house <mark4>divine</mark4><br>
Of peaceful years; a chronicle of <mark4>heaven;--</mark4><br>
Of all the sunbeams that did ever <mark4>shine</mark4><br>
The very sweetest had to thee been <mark4>given.</mark4><br>
<br>
A Picture had it been of lasting <mark4>ease,</mark4><br>
Elysian quiet, without toil or <mark3>strife;</mark3><br>
No motion but the moving tide, a <mark3>breeze,</mark3><br>
Or merely silent Nature's breathing <mark3>life.</mark3><br>
<br>
Such, in the fond illusion of my <mark5>heart,</mark5><br>
Such Picture would I at that time have <mark4>made:</mark4><br>
And seen the soul of truth in every <mark3>part,</mark3><br>
A steadfast peace that might not be <mark3>betrayed.</mark3><br>
<br>
So once it would have been,--'tis so no <mark4>more;</mark4><br>
I have submitted to a new <mark4>control:</mark4><br>
A power is gone, which nothing can <mark3>restore;</mark3><br>
A deep distress hath humanised my <mark3>Soul.</mark3><br>
<br>
Not for a moment could I now <mark4>behold</mark4><br>
A smiling sea, and be what I have <mark4>been:</mark4><br>
The feeling of my loss will ne'er be <mark3>old;</mark3><br>
This, which I know, I speak with mind <mark4>serene.</mark4><br>
<br>
Then, Beaumont, Friend! who would have been the <mark4>Friend,</mark4><br>
If he had lived, of Him whom I <mark3>deplore,</mark3><br>
This work of thine I blame not, but <mark3>commend;</mark3><br>
This sea in anger, and that dismal <mark3>shore.</mark3><br>
<br>
O 'tis a passionate Work!--yet wise and <mark4>well,</mark4><br>
Well chosen is the spirit that is <mark4>here;</mark4><br>
That Hulk which labours in the deadly <mark3>swell,</mark3><br>
This rueful sky, this pageantry of <mark4>fear!</mark4><br>
<br>
And this huge Castle, standing here <mark4>sublime,</mark4><br>
I love to see the look with which it <mark4>braves,</mark4><br>
Cased in the unfeeling armour of old <mark3>time,</mark3><br>
The lightning, the fierce wind, the trampling <mark3>waves.</mark3><br>
<br>
Farewell, farewell the heart that lives <mark4>alone,</mark4><br>
Housed in a dream, at distance from the <mark4>Kind!</mark4><br>
Such happiness, wherever it be <mark3>known,</mark3><br>
Is to be <mark4>pitied</mark4>, for 'tis surely <mark3>blind.</mark3><br>
<br>
But welcome fortitude, and patient <mark3>cheer,</mark3><br>
And frequent sights of what is to be <mark4>borne!</mark4><br>
Such sights, or worse, as are before me <mark1>here.--</mark1><br>
Not without hope we suffer and we <mark3>mourn.</mark3><br>
