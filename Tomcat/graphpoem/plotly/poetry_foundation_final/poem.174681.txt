Title : Innocence <br>
Author : Thomas Traherne <br><br>

But that which most I wonder at, which <mark3>most</mark3><br>
I did esteem my bliss, which most I <mark3>boast,</mark3><br>
And ever shall enjoy, is that <mark3>within</mark3><br>
I felt no <mark4>stain</mark4>, nor spot of <mark3>sin.</mark3><br>
<br>
No darkness then did overshade, <br>
But all within was pure and <mark4>bright,</mark4><br>
No guilt did crush, nor fear <mark4>invade</mark4><br>
But all my soul was full of <mark3>light.</mark3><br>
<br>
A joyful sense and <mark5>purity</mark5><br>
Is all I can <mark3>remember;</mark3><br>
The very night to me was <mark1>bright,</mark1><br>
'Twas summer in <mark3>December.</mark3><br>
<br>
A serious meditation did <mark3>employ</mark3><br>
My soul within, which taken up with <mark3>joy</mark3><br>
Did seem no outward thing to note, but <mark3>fly</mark3><br>
All objects that do feed the <mark3>eye.</mark3><br>
<br>
While it those very objects <mark4>did</mark4><br>
Admire, and prize, and praise, and <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
Which in their glory most are <mark3>hid,</mark3><br>
Which presence only doth <mark4>remove.</mark4><br>
<br>
Their constant daily presence <mark2>I</mark2><br>
Rejoicing at, did <mark3>see;</mark3><br>
And that which takes them from the <mark1>eye</mark1><br>
Of others, offer'd them to <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
<br>
No inward inclination did I <mark3>feel</mark3><br>
To avarice or pride: my soul did <mark3>kneel</mark3><br>
In admiration all the day. No lust, nor <mark3>strife,</mark3><br>
Polluted then my infant <mark3>life.</mark3><br>
<br>
No fraud nor anger in me mov'd, <br>
No malice, jealousy, or <mark3>spite;</mark3><br>
All that I saw I truly <mark5>lov'd.</mark5><br>
Contentment only and <mark3>delight</mark3><br>
<br>
Were in my soul. O Heav'n! what <mark4>bliss</mark4><br>
Did I enjoy and <mark1>feel!</mark1><br>
What powerful delight did <mark3>this</mark3><br>
Inspire! for this I daily <mark1>kneel.</mark1><br>
<br>
Whether it be that nature is so <mark5>pure,</mark5><br>
And custom only vicious; or that <mark3>sure</mark3><br>
God did by miracle the guilt <mark1>remove,</mark1><br>
And make my soul to feel his <mark1>love</mark1><br>
<br>
So early: or that 'twas one <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
Wherein this happiness I <mark4>found;</mark4><br>
Whose strength and brightness so do <mark3>ray,</mark3><br>
That still it seems me to <mark3>surround;</mark3><br>
<br>
What ere it is, it is a <mark1>light</mark1><br>
So endless unto <mark1>me</mark1><br>
That I a world of true <mark1>delight</mark1><br>
Did then and to this day do <mark1>see.</mark1><br>
<br>
That prospect was the gate of Heav'n, that <mark1>day</mark1><br>
The ancient light of Eden did <mark3>convey</mark3><br>
Into my soul: I was an Adam <mark4>there</mark4><br>
A little Adam in a <mark4>sphere</mark4><br>
<br>
Of joys! O there my ravish'd <mark4>sense</mark4><br>
Was entertain'd in <mark4>Paradise,</mark4><br>
And had a sight of <mark4>innocence</mark4><br>
Which was beyond all bound and <mark4>price.</mark4><br>
<br>
An antepast of Heaven <mark1>sure!</mark1><br>
I on the earth did <mark4>reign;</mark4><br>
Within, without me, all was <mark1>pure;</mark1><br>
I must become a child <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
