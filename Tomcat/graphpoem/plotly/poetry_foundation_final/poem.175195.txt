Rich, honored by my fellow <mark4>citizens,</mark4><br>
The father of many children, born of a noble mother, <br>
All raised there <br>
In the great mansion-house, at the edge of <mark4>town.</mark4><br>
Note the cedar tree on the <mark4>lawn!</mark4><br>
I sent all the boys to Ann Arbor, all the girls to <mark4>Rockford,</mark4><br>
The while my life went on, getting more riches and <mark4>honors--</mark4><br>
Resting under my cedar tree at evening. <br>
The years went <mark3>on.</mark3><br>
I sent the girls to <mark4>Europe;</mark4><br>
I dowered them when <mark4>married.</mark4><br>
I gave the boys money to start in <mark4>business.</mark4><br>
They were strong children, promising as <mark4>apples</mark4><br>
Before the bitten places show. <br>
But John fled the country in <mark4>disgrace.</mark4><br>
Jenny died in child-birth-- <br>
I sat under my cedar <mark1>tree.</mark1><br>
Harry killed himself after a debauch, <br>
Susan was divorced-- <br>
I sat under my cedar <mark1>tree.</mark1><br>
Paul was invalided from over-study, <br>
Mary became a recluse at home for love of a <mark4>man--</mark4><br>
I sat under my cedar <mark1>tree.</mark1><br>
All were gone, or broken-winged or devoured by life-- <br>
I sat under my cedar <mark1>tree.</mark1><br>
My mate, the mother of them, was <mark4>taken--</mark4><br>
I sat under my cedar <mark1>tree</mark1><br>
Till ninety years were <mark4>tolled.</mark4><br>
O maternal Earth, which rocks the fallen leaf to <mark4>sleep!</mark4><br>
