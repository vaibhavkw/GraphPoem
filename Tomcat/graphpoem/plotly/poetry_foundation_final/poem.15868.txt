Title : On Looking East to the Sea with a Sunset Behind Me<br>
Author : John Ciardi<br><br>

<br>
In a detachment cool as the glint of <mark4>light</mark4><br>
on wet roads through wet spruce, or iced <mark4>mountains</mark4><br>
hailed from the sea in moonfill, or the <mark1>sea</mark1><br>
when one horizon's black and the other <mark4>burning;</mark4><br>
the gulls are kissing time in its own <mark4>flowing</mark4><br>
<br>
over the shell-scraped rock   a coming and <mark3>going</mark3><br>
as of glass bees with a bubble of light in each   <br>
running errands in and out of the <mark4>sunset.</mark4><br>
Over the road and the spruce wood, over the <mark4>ice,</mark4><br>
<br>
and out the picture of my picture window,   <br>
the exorbitant separation of nature from <mark4>nature</mark4><br>
wheels, whirls, and dances on <mark4>itself.</mark4><br>
Now damn me for a moral. Over and <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
<br>
over and in, the gulls drift up <mark4>afire,</mark4><br>
screaming like hinges in the broken <mark4>air</mark4><br>
of night and day like two smokes on the <mark1>sea.</mark1><br>
And I do nothing. A shadow three feet <mark4>under</mark4><br>
<br>
my window in the <mark1>light</mark1>, I look at <mark1>light</mark1><br>
in one of the years of my life. This or <mark4>another.</mark4><br>
Or all together. Or simply in this <mark4>moment.</mark4><br>
Lead flags of the sea. Steel furls of the <mark4>surf.</mark4><br>
<br>
Day smoke and night smoke. Fire at the smoke's top.   <br>
<br>
A passion from the world in a calm <mark1>eye.</mark1><br>
A calm of the world in the eye of <mark4>passion.</mark4><br>
The day that sank birdless from staring Calvary   <br>
was <mark3>another</mark3>, And only another. And no <mark3>other</mark3><br>
than the clucking calm of Eden fussed to <mark4>rest</mark4><br>
<br>
from the black bush afire in the first <mark1>eye.</mark1><br>
A calm-in-violence like Aegean <mark4>time.</mark4><br>
Day smoke and night smoke over the palled <mark1>sea</mark1><br>
tensed for a clash of tridents. Far <mark4>ashore,</mark4><br>
<br>
a staring army camped beside a <mark4>temple,</mark4><br>
the base of the temple black with powder <mark4>stains,</mark4><br>
the pediment flashing wild in light above. <br>
--A day of the world in which a part of the <mark1>world</mark1><br>
<br>
looked at another, two parts of a <mark4>mist.</mark4><br>
At Cassino the dusty German wetting his <mark4>lips,</mark4><br>
his eyes crashed in his face like unhatched birds' <mark4>eggs</mark4><br>
splashed from their <mark4>nest</mark4>, looked East from the burning <mark4>night.</mark4><br>
<br>
There was no West. Light came from nowhere behind <mark4>him,</mark4><br>
slanted, flowed level, drained. He looked out, <mark4>waiting.</mark4><br>
Where had it come from, the light of his terrible <mark4>patience?</mark4><br>
A dead man waited to die on the <mark4>shell-scraped</mark4><br>
<br>
stones of another God, dust of the <mark4>stones</mark4><br>
caked to his body, rivers of blood within <mark1>him</mark1><br>
ran to their dusty sea beside the <mark1>world.</mark1><br>
Calm in his <mark1>changes</mark1>, risen from his <mark4>changes,</mark4><br>
<br>
he looked his life out at the smoking <mark1>world.</mark1><br>
I have no more to do than what I wait <mark3>for</mark3><br>
under the changing light and the gulls <mark1>afire</mark1><br>
in rays of rose-quartz. Holy ghosts of the <mark1>sea,</mark1><br>
<br>
they rise in light from behind me. The light <mark4>lifts</mark4><br>
<br>
long from the edge of the world and juts away   <br>
over the top of the dark. My life <mark4>sits</mark4><br>
visible to itself; and I sit <mark4>still</mark4><br>
in a company of survivors and the <mark4>dead.</mark4><br>
<br>
Jew. Greek, German, man at the edge of <mark4>himself</mark4><br>
in the long light over the worlds he ran to   <br>
to save unsaved. I practice the man in <mark4>all,</mark4><br>
<br>
clutching the world from the world to praise <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
