Title : Holy Sonnets: Show me dear Christ, thy spouse so bright and clear <br>
Author : John Donne <br><br>

Show me dear Christ, thy spouse so bright and <mark4>clear.</mark4><br>
What! is it she which on the other <mark4>shore</mark4><br>
Goes richly painted? or which, robb'd and <mark3>tore,</mark3><br>
Laments and mourns in Germany and <mark4>here?</mark4><br>
Sleeps she a thousand, then peeps up one <mark4>year?</mark4><br>
Is she self-truth, and errs? now new, now outwore? <br>
Doth she, and did she, and shall she <mark4>evermore</mark4><br>
On one, on seven, or on no hill <mark4>appear?</mark4><br>
Dwells she with <mark4>us</mark4>, or like adventuring <mark4>knights</mark4><br>
First travel we to seek, and then make <mark3>love?</mark3><br>
Betray, kind husband, thy spouse to our <mark3>sights,</mark3><br>
And let mine amorous soul court thy mild <mark3>Dove,</mark3><br>
Who is most true and pleasing to thee <mark3>then</mark3><br>
When she'is embrac'd and open to most <mark3>men.</mark3><br>
