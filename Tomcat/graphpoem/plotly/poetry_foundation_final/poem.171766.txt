Title : The Ship Pounding <br>
Author : Donald Hall <br><br>

Each morning I made my <mark3>way</mark3><br>
among gangways, <mark4>elevators,</mark4><br>
and nurses' pods to Jane's <mark4>room</mark4><br>
to interrogate the grave <mark4>helpers</mark4><br>
who tended her through the <mark4>night</mark4><br>
while the ship's massive <mark4>engines</mark4><br>
kept its propellers <mark4>turning.</mark4><br>
Week after week, I sat by her <mark4>bed</mark4><br>
with black coffee and the Globe.   <br>
The passengers on this <mark4>voyage</mark4><br>
wore masks or cannulae <br>
or dangled devices that <mark4>dripped</mark4><br>
chemicals into their wrists.   <br>
I believed that the ship <br>
traveled to a harbor <br>
of breakfast, work, and love.   <br>
I wrote: "When the <mark4>infusions</mark4><br>
are infused entirely, <mark4>bone</mark4><br>
marrow restored and lymphoblasts   <br>
remitted, I will take my wife,   <br>
bald as Michael <mark4>Jordan,</mark4><br>
back to our dog and <mark3>day.</mark3>, <mark3>Today,</mark3><br>
months later at home, <mark4>these</mark4><br>
words turned up on my <mark5>desk</mark5><br>
as I listened in case Jane <mark4>called</mark4><br>
for help, or spoke in <mark4>delirium,</mark4><br>
ready to make the <mark4>agitated</mark4><br>
drive to Emergency <mark4>again</mark4><br>
for readmission to the <mark4>huge</mark4><br>
vessel that heaves water month   <br>
after month, without <mark4>leaving</mark4><br>
<mark4>port</mark4>, without moving a <mark4>knot,</mark4><br>
without arrival or <mark4>destination,</mark4><br>
its great engines <mark4>pounding.</mark4><br>
