Title : A Song: When June is past, the fading rose <br>
Author : Thomas Carew <br><br>

Ask me no more where Jove <mark3>bestows,</mark3><br>
When June is past, the fading <mark3>rose;</mark3><br>
For in your beauty's orient <mark3>deep</mark3><br>
These flowers as in their causes, <mark3>sleep.</mark3><br>
<br>
Ask me no more whither doth <mark3>stray</mark3><br>
The golden atoms of the <mark3>day;</mark3><br>
For in pure love heaven did <mark3>prepare</mark3><br>
Those powders to enrich your <mark3>hair.</mark3><br>
<br>
Ask me no more whither doth <mark4>haste</mark4><br>
The nightingale when May is <mark4>past;</mark4><br>
For in your sweet dividing <mark4>throat</mark4><br>
She winters and keeps warm her <mark3>note.</mark3><br>
<br>
Ask me no more where those stars <mark4>light</mark4><br>
That downwards fall in dead of <mark3>night;</mark3><br>
For in your eyes they sit, and <mark3>there,</mark3><br>
Fixed become as in their <mark4>sphere.</mark4><br>
<br>
Ask me no more if east or <mark4>west</mark4><br>
The phoenix builds her spicy <mark3>nest;</mark3><br>
For unto you at last she <mark4>flies,</mark4><br>
And in your fragrant bosom <mark3>dies.</mark3><br>
