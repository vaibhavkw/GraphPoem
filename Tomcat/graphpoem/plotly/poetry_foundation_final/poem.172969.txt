Title : Plead for Me <br>
Author : Emily Bronte <br><br>

O thy bright eyes must answer <mark3>now,</mark3><br>
When Reason, with a scornful <mark3>brow,</mark3><br>
Is mocking at my overthrow;<br>
O thy sweet tongue must plead for <mark3>me</mark3><br>
And tell why I have chosen <mark3>thee!</mark3><br>
<br>
Stern Reason is to judgment <mark4>come</mark4><br>
Arrayed in all her forms of <mark4>gloom:</mark4><br>
Wilt thou my advocate be <mark4>dumb?</mark4><br>
No, radiant angel, speak and <mark3>say</mark3><br>
Why I did cast the world <mark3>away;</mark3><br>
<br>
Why I have persevered to <mark3>shun</mark3><br>
The common paths that others <mark3>run;</mark3><br>
And on a strange road journeyed <mark4>on</mark4><br>
Heedless alike of Wealth and <mark3>Power--</mark3><br>
Of Glory's wreath and Pleasure's <mark3>flower.</mark3><br>
<br>
These once indeed seemed Beings <mark4>divine,</mark4><br>
And they perchance heard vows of <mark3>mine</mark3><br>
And saw my offerings on their <mark3>shrine--</mark3><br>
But, careless gifts are seldom <mark3>prized,</mark3><br>
And mine were worthily <mark3>despised;</mark3><br>
<br>
So with a ready heart I <mark3>swore</mark3><br>
To seek their altar-stone no <mark3>more,</mark3><br>
And gave my spirit to <mark3>adore</mark3><br>
Thee, ever present, phantom <mark3>thing--</mark3><br>
My slave, my comrade, and my <mark3>King!</mark3><br>
<br>
A slave because I rule thee <mark3>still;</mark3><br>
Incline thee to my changeful <mark3>will</mark3><br>
And make thy influence good or <mark3>ill--</mark3><br>
A comrade, for by day and <mark3>night</mark3><br>
Thou art my intimate <mark3>delight--</mark3><br>
<br>
My Darling Pain that wounds and <mark3>sears</mark3><br>
And wrings a blessing out from <mark3>tears</mark3><br>
By deadening me to real <mark3>cares;</mark3><br>
And yet, a king--though prudence <mark4>well</mark4><br>
Have taught thy subject to <mark3>rebel.</mark3><br>
<br>
And am I wrong to worship <mark4>where</mark4><br>
Faith cannot doubt nor Hope <mark3>despair,</mark3><br>
Since my own soul can grant my <mark3>prayer?</mark3><br>
Speak, God of Visions, plead for <mark1>me</mark1><br>
And tell why I have chosen <mark1>thee!</mark1><br>
