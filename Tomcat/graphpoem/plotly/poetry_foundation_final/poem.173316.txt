Title : Two Went up into the Temple to Pray <br>
Author : Richard Crashaw <br><br>

Two went to pray? O rather <mark3>say</mark3><br>
One went to brag, th' other to <mark3>pray:</mark3><br>
<br>
One stands up close and treads on <mark3>high,</mark3><br>
Where th' other dares not send his <mark3>eye.</mark3><br>
<br>
One nearer to God's altar <mark3>trod,</mark3><br>
The other to the altar's <mark3>God.</mark3><br>
