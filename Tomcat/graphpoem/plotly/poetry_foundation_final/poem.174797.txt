<br>
Milton! thou shouldst be living at this <mark3>hour:</mark3><br>
England hath need of thee: she is a <mark3>fen</mark3><br>
Of stagnant waters: altar, sword, and <mark3>pen,</mark3><br>
Fireside, the heroic wealth of hall and <mark3>bower,</mark3><br>
Have forfeited their ancient English <mark3>dower</mark3><br>
Of inward happiness. We are selfish <mark3>men;</mark3><br>
Oh! raise us up, return to us <mark3>again;</mark3><br>
And give us manners, virtue, freedom, <mark3>power.</mark3><br>
Thy soul was like a Star, and dwelt <mark3>apart:</mark3><br>
Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the <mark3>sea:</mark3><br>
Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
So didst thou travel on life's common <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
In cheerful godliness; and yet thy <mark3>heart</mark3><br>
The lowliest duties on herself did <mark3>lay.</mark3><br>
