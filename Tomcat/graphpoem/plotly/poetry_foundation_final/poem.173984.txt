Title : The Betrothal <br>
Author : Edna St. Vincent Millay <br><br>

Oh, come, my lad, or go, my <mark1>lad,</mark1><br>
And love me if you <mark3>like.</mark3><br>
I shall not hear the door shut<br>
Nor the knocker <mark3>strike.</mark3><br>
<br>
Oh, bring me gifts or beg me gifts,<br>
And wed me if you <mark3>will.</mark3><br>
I'd make a man a good wife,<br>
Sensible and <mark3>still.</mark3><br>
<br>
And why should I be <mark4>cold</mark4>, my <mark1>lad,</mark1><br>
And why should you repine,<br>
Because I love a dark <mark4>head</mark4><br>
That never will be mine?<br>
<br>
I might as well be easing <mark5>you</mark5><br>
As lie alone in <mark3>bed</mark3><br>
And waste the night in wanting<br>
A cruel dark <mark1>head.</mark1><br>
<br>
You might as well be calling <mark5>yours</mark5><br>
What never will be <mark4>his,</mark4><br>
And one of us be happy.<br>
There's few enough as <mark3>is.</mark3><br>
