Title : In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 45 <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

The baby new to earth and <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
What time his tender palm is <mark3>prest</mark3><br>
Against the circle of the <mark3>breast,</mark3><br>
Has never thought that "this is <mark3>I":</mark3><br>
<br>
But as he grows he gathers <mark3>much,</mark3><br>
And learns the use of "I," and <mark3>"me,"</mark3><br>
And finds "I am not what I <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
And other than the things I <mark3>touch."</mark3><br>
<br>
So rounds he to a separate <mark3>mind</mark3><br>
From whence clear memory may <mark3>begin,</mark3><br>
As thro' the frame that binds him <mark3>in</mark3><br>
His isolation grows <mark3>defined.</mark3><br>
<br>
This use may lie in blood and <mark5>breath</mark5><br>
Which else were fruitless of their <mark3>due,</mark3><br>
Had man to learn himself <mark3>anew</mark3><br>
Beyond the second birth of <mark3>Death.</mark3><br>
