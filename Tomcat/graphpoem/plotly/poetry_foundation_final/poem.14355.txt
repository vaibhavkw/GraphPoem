Title : The Nuns Assist at Childbirth<br>
Author : Barbara Howes<br><br>

Robed in dungeon black, in mourning   <br>
For themselves they pass, repace   <br>
The dark linoleum <mark4>corridors</mark4><br>
Of humid wards, sure in the <mark4>grace</mark4><br>
<br>
Of self-denial. Blown by duty,   <br>
Jet sails borne by a high <mark3>wind,</mark3><br>
Only the face and hands creep through   <br>
The shapeless clothing, to <mark3>remind</mark3><br>
<br>
One that a woman lives <mark4>within</mark4><br>
The wrappings of this strange <mark4>cocoon.</mark4><br>
Her hands reach from these veils of <mark4>death</mark4><br>
To harvest a child from the raw womb. <br>
<br>
The metal scales of <mark4>paradox</mark4><br>
Tip here then there. What can the <mark4>nun</mark4><br>
Think of the butchery of <mark4>birth,</mark4><br>
Mastery of the flesh, this <mark3>one</mark3><br>
<br>
Vigorous mystery? Rude life <br>
From the volcano rolls and <mark4>pours,</mark4><br>
Tragic, regenerate, <mark4>wild</mark4>, <mark4>Sad,</mark4><br>
The unborn wait behind closed <mark3>doors.</mark3><br>
