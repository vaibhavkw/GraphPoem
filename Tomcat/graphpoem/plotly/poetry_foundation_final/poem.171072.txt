Title : On Munsungun <br>
Author : Ethan Stebbins <br><br>

My father in the aluminum stern, <mark4>cursing</mark4><br>
another fouled blood-knot: all the <mark3>shits</mark3><br>
<br>
and fucks as integral to the art of <mark4>fishing</mark4><br>
as the bait-fish, little silver smelts   <br>
<br>
I sewed like a manual <mark4>transmission,</mark4><br>
the same inbred order and <mark4>precision</mark4><br>
<br>
needling the leader through the <mark4>ass,</mark4><br>
out the mouth, through the jaw, out the <mark4>nostril</mark4><br>
<br>
and back down--suffering as my father suffered <br>
the bastard no-see-ums and the guttering <mark4>Johnson</mark4><br>
<br>
the obligatory dud, orange <mark4>egg-pearls</mark4><br>
ballooning from its bust underside, hundreds of <mark4>duds</mark4><br>
<br>
like every shit-luck setback that drove us <mark4>on,</mark4><br>
fed by the huge image of <mark4>everything</mark4><br>
<br>
we'd never caught, moving in joint <mark4>blindness</mark4><br>
under Munsungun. <br>
And whatever it <mark4>was</mark4><br>
it was the fight that delivered us--a <mark4>tension</mark4><br>
<br>
like a sequestered muscle, the <mark4>line</mark4><br>
spooling, unspooling, the <mark3>holy-shit-</mark3><br>
<br>
litany pulled from our awed <mark4>mouths</mark4><br>
contracting with distance until a <mark4>whole</mark4><br>
<br>
silence surfaced, the viscid, slapping body   <br>
absorbing and reflecting raw <mark4>light</mark4><br>
<br>
like the bit of cornea above a <mark4>pupil.</mark4><br>
And then his tremendous, decent <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
<br>
brandishing an oar-butt; the brilliant <mark4>lace</mark4><br>
of the gills, their crumpled hinge <mark4>flaring</mark4><br>
<br>
in bilge water; and the line, <mark4>whipping</mark4><br>
and shuttling, feeding invisibly back, <br>
<br>
moving on on Munsungun, <mark4>sons</mark4><br>
survived by the same damn hunt they heired.<br>
