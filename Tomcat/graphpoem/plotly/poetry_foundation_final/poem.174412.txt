Title : To ---- <br>
Author : Percy Bysshe Shelley <br><br>

   One word is too often profaned<br>
For me to profane <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
One feeling too falsely disdained<br>
For thee to disdain <mark1>it;</mark1><br>
One hope is too like <mark4>despair</mark4><br>
For prudence to <mark3>smother,</mark3><br>
And pity from thee more <mark4>dear</mark4><br>
Than that from <mark3>another.</mark3><br>
<br>
I can give not what men call <mark3>love,</mark3><br>
But wilt thou accept <mark4>not</mark4><br>
The worship the heart lifts <mark3>above</mark3><br>
And the Heavens reject <mark1>not,?</mark1><br>
The desire of the moth for the <mark4>star,</mark4><br>
Of the night for the <mark3>morrow,</mark3><br>
The devotion to something <mark3>afar</mark3><br>
From the sphere of our <mark3>sorrow?</mark3><br>
