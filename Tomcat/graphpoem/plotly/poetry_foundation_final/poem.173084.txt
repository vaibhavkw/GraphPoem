Author : Lord Byron (George Gordon) <br><br>

Difficile est proprie communia dicere HOR. Epist. ad Pison<br>
<br>
Bob Southey! You're a poet--Poet-laureate, <br>
And representative of all the <mark3>race;</mark3><br>
Although 'tis true that you turn'd out a Tory <mark1>at</mark1><br>
Last--yours has lately been a common <mark3>case;</mark3><br>
And now, my Epic Renegade! what are ye <mark1>at?</mark1><br>
With all the Lakers, in and out of <mark3>place?</mark3><br>
A nest of tuneful persons, to my <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
Like "four and twenty Blackbirds in a <mark3>pye;</mark3><br>
<br>
"Which pye being open'd they began to <mark3>sing"</mark3><br>
(This old song and new simile holds <mark4>good),</mark4><br>
"A dainty dish to set before the <mark3>King,"</mark3><br>
Or Regent, who admires such kind of <mark4>food;</mark4><br>
And Coleridge, too, has lately taken <mark3>wing,</mark3><br>
But like a hawk encumber'd with his <mark4>hood,</mark4><br>
Explaining Metaphysics to the <mark3>nation--</mark3><br>
I wish he would explain his <mark3>Explanation.</mark3><br>
You, Bob! are rather insolent, you <mark3>know,</mark3><br>
<br>
At being disappointed in your <mark3>wish</mark3><br>
To supersede all warblers here <mark3>below,</mark3><br>
And be the only Blackbird in the <mark3>dish;</mark3><br>
And then you overstrain yourself, or <mark3>so,</mark3><br>
And tumble downward like the flying <mark3>fish</mark3><br>
Gasping on deck, because you soar too high, <mark1>Bob,</mark1><br>
And fall, for lack of moisture quite a-dry, <mark1>Bob!</mark1><br>
And Wordsworth, in a rather long <mark4>"Excursion"</mark4><br>
(I think the quarto holds five hundred <mark3>pages),</mark3><br>
<br>
Has given a sample from the vasty <mark3>version</mark3><br>
Of his new system to perplex the <mark3>sages;</mark3><br>
'Tis poetry--at least by his <mark4>assertion,</mark4><br>
And may appear so when the dog-star <mark3>rages--</mark3><br>
And he who understands it would be <mark4>able</mark4><br>
To add a story to the Tower of <mark4>Babel.</mark4><br>
You--Gentlemen! by dint of long <mark4>seclusion</mark4><br>
From better company, have kept your <mark4>own</mark4><br>
At Keswick, and, through still continu'd <mark4>fusion</mark4><br>
<br>
Of one another's minds, at last have <mark4>grown</mark4><br>
To deem as a most logical <mark4>conclusion,</mark4><br>
That Poesy has wreaths for you <mark4>alone:</mark4><br>
There is a narrowness in such a <mark4>notion,</mark4><br>
Which makes me wish you'd change your lakes for <mark3>Ocean.</mark3><br>
I would not imitate the petty <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
Nor coin my self-love to so base a <mark4>vice,</mark4><br>
For all the glory your conversion <mark3>brought,</mark3><br>
Since gold alone should not have been its <mark3>price.</mark3><br>
<br>
You have your salary; was't for that you <mark3>wrought?</mark3><br>
And Wordsworth has his place in the <mark3>Excise.</mark3><br>
You're shabby fellows--true--but poets <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
And duly seated on the Immortal <mark3>Hill.</mark3><br>
Your bays may hide the baldness of your <mark4>brows--</mark4><br>
Perhaps some virtuous blushes--let them <mark3>go--</mark3><br>
To you I envy neither fruit nor <mark3>boughs--</mark3><br>
And for the fame you would engross <mark1>below,</mark1><br>
The field is universal, and <mark3>allows</mark3><br>
<br>
Scope to all such as feel the inherent <mark3>glow:</mark3><br>
Scott, Rogers, Campbell, Moore and Crabbe, will <mark3>try</mark3><br>
'Gainst you the question with <mark1>posterity.</mark1><br>
For me, who, wandering with pedestrian <mark4>Muses,</mark4><br>
Contend not with you on the winged <mark4>steed,</mark4><br>
I wish your fate may yield ye, when she <mark3>chooses,</mark3><br>
The fame you envy, and the skill you <mark3>need;</mark3><br>
And, recollect, a poet nothing <mark3>loses</mark3><br>
       In giving to his brethren their full meed <br>
<br>
Of merit, and complaint of present <mark4>days</mark4><br>
Is not the certain path to future <mark3>praise.</mark3><br>
He that reserves his laurels for <mark1>posterity</mark1><br>
(Who does not often claim the bright <mark4>reversion)</mark4><br>
Has generally no great crop to spare it, <mark3>he</mark3><br>
Being only injur'd by his own <mark1>assertion;</mark1><br>
And although here and there some glorious <mark3>rarity</mark3><br>
Arise like Titan from the sea's <mark4>immersion,</mark4><br>
The major part of such appellants <mark1>go</mark1><br>
<br>
To--God knows where--for no one else can <mark1>know.</mark1><br>
If, fallen in evil days on evil <mark4>tongues,</mark4><br>
Milton appeal'd to the Avenger, <mark3>Time,</mark3><br>
If Time, the Avenger, execrates his <mark4>wrongs,</mark4><br>
And makes the word "Miltonic" mean <mark3>"sublime,"</mark3><br>
He deign'd not to belie his soul in <mark3>songs,</mark3><br>
Nor turn his very talent to a <mark3>crime;</mark3><br>
He did not loathe the Sire to laud the <mark4>Son,</mark4><br>
But clos'd the tyrant-hater he <mark3>begun.</mark3><br>
<br>
Think'st thou, could he--the blind Old Man--arise <br>
Like Samuel from the grave, to freeze once <mark3>more</mark3><br>
The blood of monarchs with his <mark4>prophecies</mark4><br>
Or be alive again--again all <mark3>hoar</mark3><br>
With time and <mark4>trials</mark4>, and those helpless <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
And heartless daughters--worn--and pale--and <mark4>poor;</mark4><br>
Would he adore a sultan? he obey <br>
The intellectual eunuch Castlereagh? <br>
Cold-blooded, smooth-fac'd, placid <mark4>miscreant!</mark4><br>
<br>
Dabbling its sleek young hands in Erin's <mark4>gore,</mark4><br>
And thus for wider carnage taught to <mark4>pant,</mark4><br>
Transferr'd to gorge upon a sister <mark3>shore,</mark3><br>
The vulgarest tool that Tyranny could <mark4>want,</mark4><br>
With just enough of talent, and no <mark1>more,</mark1><br>
To lengthen fetters by another <mark4>fix'd,</mark4><br>
And offer poison long already <mark3>mix'd.</mark3><br>
An orator of such set trash of <mark4>phrase</mark4><br>
Ineffably--legitimately <mark4>vile,</mark4><br>
<br>
That even its grossest flatterers dare not <mark1>praise,</mark1><br>
Nor foes--all nations--condescend to <mark3>smile,</mark3><br>
Not even a sprightly blunder's spark can <mark3>blaze</mark3><br>
From that Ixion grindstone's ceaseless <mark4>toil,</mark4><br>
That turns and turns to give the world a <mark1>notion</mark1><br>
Of endless torments and perpetual <mark3>motion.</mark3><br>
A bungler even in its disgusting <mark4>trade,</mark4><br>
And botching, patching, leaving still <mark4>behind</mark4><br>
Something of which its masters are <mark4>afraid,</mark4><br>
<br>
States to be curb'd, and thoughts to be <mark5>confin'd,</mark5><br>
Conspiracy or Congress to be <mark3>made--</mark3><br>
Cobbling at manacles for all <mark4>mankind--</mark4><br>
A tinkering slave-maker, who mends old <mark4>chains,</mark4><br>
With God and Man's abhorrence for its <mark3>gains.</mark3><br>
If we may judge of matter by the <mark3>mind,</mark3><br>
Emasculated to the marrow  <mark4>It</mark4><br>
Hath but two objects, how to serve, and <mark3>bind,</mark3><br>
Deeming the chain it wears even men may <mark3>fit,</mark3><br>
<br>
Eutropius of its many masters, <mark3>blind</mark3><br>
To worth as freedom, wisdom as to <mark3>Wit,</mark3><br>
Fearless--because no feeling dwells in <mark3>ice,</mark3><br>
Its very courage stagnates to a <mark1>vice.</mark1><br>
Where shall I turn me not to view its <mark4>bonds,</mark4><br>
       For I will never feel them?--Italy! <br>
Thy late reviving Roman soul desponds <br>
Beneath the lie this State-thing breath'd o'er <mark3>thee--</mark3><br>
Thy clanking chain, and Erin's yet green <mark4>wounds,</mark4><br>
<br>
Have voices--tongues to cry aloud for <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
Europe has slaves--allies--kings--armies <mark1>still,</mark1><br>
And Southey lives to sing them very <mark3>ill.</mark3><br>
Meantime--Sir Laureate--I proceed to <mark4>dedicate,</mark4><br>
In honest simple verse, this song to <mark3>you,</mark3><br>
And, if in flattering strains I do not <mark3>predicate,</mark3><br>
'Tis that I still retain my "buff and <mark3>blue";</mark3><br>
My politics as yet are all to <mark3>educate:</mark3><br>
Apostasy's so fashionable, <mark3>too,</mark3><br>
<br>
To keep one creed's a task grown quite <mark4>Herculean;</mark4><br>
Is it not so, my Tory, <mark3>ultra-Julian?</mark3><br>
