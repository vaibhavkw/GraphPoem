Title : Queens Cemetery, Setting Sun <br>
Author : Lawrence Ferlinghetti <br><br>

Airport bus from JFK <br>
cruising through <mark4>Queens</mark4><br>
passing huge endless <mark4>cemetery</mark4><br>
by Long Island's old expressway <br>
(once a dirt path for wheelless <mark4>Indians)</mark4><br>
myriad small tombstones tilted up   <br>
gesturing statues on <mark1>parapets</mark1><br>
stone arms or wings upraised   <br>
lost among illegible <mark4>inscriptions</mark4><br>
And the setting yellow <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
painting all of <mark4>them</mark4><br>
on one side <mark4>only</mark4><br>
with an ochre brush <br>
Rows and rows and rows and <mark4>rows</mark4><br>
of small stone <mark4>slabs</mark4><br>
tilted toward the sun forever   <br>
While on the far <mark4>horizon</mark4><br>
Mannahatta's great stone <mark1>slabs</mark1><br>
skyscraper tombs and <mark1>parapets</mark1><br>
casting their own long black <mark4>shadows</mark4><br>
over all these long-haired <mark4>graves</mark4><br>
the final restless <mark4>places</mark4><br>
of old-country potato <mark4>farmers</mark4><br>
dustbin pawnbrokers <br>
dead dagos and Dublin <mark4>bouncers</mark4><br>
tinsmiths and blacksmiths and <mark4>roofers</mark4><br>
house painters and house <mark4>carpenters</mark4><br>
cabinet makers and cigar <mark4>makers</mark4><br>
garment workers and streetcar motormen   <br>
railroad switchmen and signal <mark4>salesmen</mark4><br>
swabbers and sweepers and <mark4>swampers</mark4><br>
steam-fitters and key-punch <mark4>operators</mark4><br>
ward heelers and labor <mark4>organizers</mark4><br>
railroad dicks and smalltime mafiosi   <br>
shopkeepers and saloon keepers and doormen <br>
icemen and middlemen and conmen   <br>
housekeepers and housewives and dowagers   <br>
French housemaids and Swedish <mark4>cooks</mark4><br>
Brooklyn barmaids and Bronxville <mark4>butlers</mark4><br>
opera singers and gandy <mark4>dancers</mark4><br>
pitchers and <mark4>catchers</mark4><br>
in the days of ragtime baseball   <br>
poolroom hustlers and fight <mark4>promoters</mark4><br>
Catholic sisters of <mark4>charity</mark4><br>
parish priests and Irish <mark4>cops</mark4><br>
Viennese doctors of <mark4>delirium</mark4><br>
now all abandoned in <mark4>eternity</mark4><br>
parcels in a dead-letter <mark4>office</mark4><br>
inscrutable addresses on <mark1>them</mark1><br>
beyond further <mark4>deliverance</mark4><br>
in an America wheeling past <mark1>them</mark1><br>
and disappearing <mark4>oblivious</mark4><br>
into East River's echoing <mark4>tunnels</mark4><br>
down the great American <mark4>drain</mark4><br>
