Title : Falling <br>
Author : James L. Dickey <br><br>

A 29-year-old stewardess fell ... to her death tonight when she was swept through an emergency door that sud- denly sprang open ... The body ... was found ... three hours after the accident.                                                                            --New York <mark4>Times</mark4><br>
The states when they black out and lie there rolling    when they <mark4>turn</mark4><br>
To something transcontinental    move by    drawing moonlight out of the <mark4>great</mark4><br>
One-sided stone hung off the starboard wingtip    some sleeper next <mark3>to</mark3><br>
An engine is groaning for coffee    and there is faintly coming <mark4>in</mark4><br>
Somewhere the vast beast-whistle of <mark4>space</mark4>, In the galley with its <mark4>racks</mark4><br>
Of trays    she rummages for a blanket    and moves in her slim <mark4>tailored</mark4><br>
Uniform to pin it over the cry at the top of the door. As though she <mark3>blew</mark3><br>
<br>
The door down with a silent blast from her lungs    frozen    she is <mark4>black</mark4><br>
Out finding herself    with the plane nowhere and her body taken by the <mark4>throat</mark4><br>
The undying cry of the void    falling    living    beginning to be <mark4>something</mark4><br>
That no one has ever been and lived through    screaming without enough <mark4>air</mark4><br>
Still neat    lipsticked    stockinged    girdled by regulation    her <mark4>hat</mark4><br>
Still on    her arms and legs in no world    and yet spaced also <mark4>strangely</mark4><br>
With utter placid rightness on thin air    taking her time    she holds <mark4>it</mark4><br>
In many places    and now, still thousands of feet from her death she <mark4>seems</mark4><br>
To slow    she develops interest    she turns in her maneuverable <mark4>body</mark4><br>
<br>
To watch it. She is hung high up in the overwhelming middle of things in her <br>
Self    in low body-whistling wrapped intensely    in all her dark <mark4>dance-weight</mark4><br>
Coming down from a marvellous leap    with the delaying, dumfounding <mark4>ease</mark4><br>
Of a dream of being drawn    like endless moonlight to the harvest <mark4>soil</mark4><br>
Of a central state of one's country    with a great gradual warmth <mark4>coming</mark4><br>
Over her    floating    finding more and more breath in what she has been <mark4>using</mark4><br>
For breath    as the levels become more human    seeing clouds placed <mark4>honestly</mark4><br>
Below her left and right    riding slowly toward them    she clasps it <mark4>all</mark4><br>
To her and can hang her hands and feet in it in peculiar ways    <mark4>and</mark4><br>
Her eyes opened wide by wind, can open her mouth as wide    wider and <mark4>suck</mark4><br>
All the heat from the cornfields    can go down on her back with a <mark4>feeling</mark4><br>
Of stupendous pillows stacked under her    and can turn    turn as to <mark4>someone</mark4><br>
In bed    smile, understood in darkness    can go away    slant    <mark4>slide</mark4><br>
Off tumbling    into the emblem of a bird with its wings <mark4>half-spread</mark4><br>
Or whirl madly on herself    in endless gymnastics in the growing <mark4>warmth</mark4><br>
Of wheatfields rising toward the harvest moon.    There is time to <mark4>live</mark4><br>
In superhuman health    seeing mortal unreachable lights far down <mark4>seeing</mark4><br>
An ultimate highway with one late priceless car probing it    <mark4>arriving</mark4><br>
In a square town    and off her starboard arm the glitter of water <mark4>catches</mark4><br>
The moon by its one shaken side    <mark4>scaled</mark4>, roaming silver    My God it is <mark4>good</mark4><br>
And evil    lying in one after another of all the positions for <mark4>love</mark4><br>
Making    dancing    sleeping    and now cloud wisps at her <mark1>no</mark1><br>
Raincoat    no matter    all small towns brokenly brighter from <mark4>inside</mark4><br>
Cloud    she walks over them like rain    bursts out to behold a <mark4>Greyhound</mark4><br>
Bus shooting light through its sides    it is the signal to go <mark3>straight</mark3><br>
Down like a glorious diver    then feet first    her skirt stripped <mark4>beautifully</mark4><br>
Up    her face in fear-scented cloths    her legs deliriously bare    <mark4>then</mark4><br>
Arms out    she slow-rolls over    steadies out    waits for something <mark1>great</mark1><br>
To take control of her    trembles near feathers    planes <mark4>head-down</mark4><br>
The quick movements of bird-necks turning her head    gold eyes the <mark4>insight-</mark4><br>
eyesight of owls blazing into the hencoops    a taste for chicken <mark4>overwhelming</mark4><br>
Her    the long-range vision of hawks enlarging all human lights of <mark4>cars</mark4><br>
Freight trains    looped bridges    enlarging the moon racing <mark4>slowly</mark4><br>
Through all the curves of a river    all the darks of the midwest <mark4>blazing</mark4><br>
From above. A rabbit in a bush turns white    the smothering <mark4>chickens</mark4><br>
Huddle    for over them there is still time for something to <mark1>live</mark1><br>
With the streaming half-idea of a long stoop    a hurtling    a <mark3>fall</mark3><br>
That is controlled    that plummets as it wills    turns <mark4>gravity</mark4><br>
Into a new condition, showing its other side like a moon    <mark4>shining</mark4><br>
New Powers    there is still time to live on a breath made of <mark4>nothing</mark4><br>
But the whole night    time for her to remember to arrange her <mark4>skirt</mark4><br>
Like a diagram of a bat    tightly it guides her    she has this <mark4>flying-skin</mark4><br>
Made of garments    and there are also those sky-divers on tv    <mark4>sailing</mark4><br>
In sunlight    smiling under their goggles    swapping batons back and <mark4>forth</mark4><br>
And He who jumped without a chute and was handed one by a <mark4>diving</mark4><br>
Buddy. She looks for her grinning companion    white teeth    <mark4>nowhere</mark4><br>
She is screaming    singing hymns    her thin human wings spread <mark4>out</mark4><br>
From her neat shoulders    the air beast-crooning to her    <mark4>warbling</mark4><br>
And she can no longer behold the huge partial form of the world    <mark5>now</mark5><br>
She is watching her country lose its evoked master shape    watching it <mark4>lose</mark4><br>
And gain    get back its houses and peoples    watching it bring <mark4>up</mark4><br>
Its local lights    single homes    lamps on barn roofs    if she <mark4>fell</mark4><br>
Into water she might live    like a diver    cleaving    perfect    plunge <br>
<br>
Into another    heavy silver    unbreathable    slowing    <mark4>saving</mark4><br>
Element: there is water    there is time to perfect all the <mark4>fine</mark4><br>
Points of diving    feet together    toes pointed    hands shaped <mark4>right</mark4><br>
To insert her into water like a needle    to come out healthily <mark4>dripping</mark4><br>
And be handed a Coca-Cola    there they are    there are the <mark4>waters</mark4><br>
Of life    the moon packed and coiled in a reservoir    so let me <mark4>begin</mark4><br>
To plane across the night air of Kansas    opening my eyes superhumanly <br>
Bright    to the damned moon    opening the natural wings of my <mark4>jacket</mark4><br>
By Don Loper    moving like a hunting owl toward the glitter of <mark5>water</mark5><br>
One cannot just fall    just tumble screaming all that time    one must <mark4>use</mark4><br>
It    she is now through with all    through all    clouds    damp    <mark4>hair</mark4><br>
Straightened    the last wisp of fog pulled apart on her face like wool <mark4>revealing</mark4><br>
New darks    new progressions of headlights along dirt roads from <mark4>chaos</mark4><br>
<br>
And night    a gradual warming    a new-made, inevitable world of one's <mark4>own</mark4><br>
Country    a great stone of light in its waiting waters    hold    hold <mark1>out</mark1><br>
For water: who knows when what correct young woman must take up her <mark1>body</mark1><br>
And fly    and head for the moon-crazed inner eye of midwest <mark4>imprisoned</mark4><br>
Water    stored up for her for years    the arms of her jacket <mark4>slipping</mark4><br>
Air up her sleeves to go    all over her? What final things can be <mark4>said</mark4><br>
Of one who starts her sheerly in her body in the high middle of <mark4>night</mark4><br>
Air    to track down water like a rabbit where it lies like life <mark4>itself</mark4><br>
Off to the right in Kansas? She goes toward    the blazing-bare <mark4>lake</mark4><br>
Her skirts neat    her hands and face warmed more and more by the <mark1>air</mark1><br>
Rising from pastures of beans    and under her    under chenille bedspreads <br>
The farm girls are feeling the goddess in them struggle and rise <mark4>brooding</mark4><br>
On the scratch-shining posts of the bed    dreaming of female <mark4>signs</mark4><br>
Of the moon    male blood like iron    of what is really said by the <mark3>moan</mark3><br>
Of airliners passing over them at dead of midwest midnight    <mark4>passing</mark4><br>
Over brush fires    burning out in silence on little hills    and will <mark3>wake</mark3><br>
To see the woman they should be    struggling on the rooftree to <mark4>become</mark4><br>
Stars: for her the ground is closer    water is nearer    she <mark4>passes</mark4><br>
It    then banks    turns    her sleeves fluttering differently as she <mark4>rolls</mark4><br>
Out to face the <mark4>east</mark4>, where the sun shall come up from wheatfields she <mark4>must</mark4><br>
Do something with water    fly to it    fall in it    drink it    <mark4>rise</mark4><br>
From it    but there is none left upon earth    the clouds have drunk it <mark4>back</mark4><br>
The plants have sucked it down    there are standing toward her <mark4>only</mark4><br>
The common fields of death    she comes back from flying to <mark4>falling</mark4><br>
Returns to a powerful cry    the silent scream with which she blew <mark4>down</mark4><br>
The coupled door of the airliner    nearly    nearly losing <mark4>hold</mark4><br>
Of what she has done    remembers    remembers the shape at the <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
Of cloud    fashionably swirling    remembers she still has time to die <br>
Beyond explanation. Let her now take off her hat in summer air the <mark4>contour</mark4><br>
Of cornfields    and have enough time to kick off her one <mark4>remaining</mark4><br>
Shoe with the toes    of the other foot    to unhook her <mark4>stockings</mark4><br>
With calm fingers, noting how fatally easy it is to undress in <mark4>midair</mark4><br>
Near death    when the body will assume without effort any <mark4>position</mark4><br>
Except the one that will sustain it    enable it to rise    <mark1>live</mark1><br>
Not die    nine farms hover close    widen    eight of them separate, <mark4>leaving</mark4><br>
One in the middle    then the fields of that farm do the same    there is <mark1>no</mark1><br>
Way to back off    from her chosen ground    but she sheds the <mark1>jacket</mark1><br>
With its silver sad impotent wings    sheds the bat's guiding <mark5>tailpiece</mark5><br>
Of her skirt    the lightning-charged clinging of her blouse    the <mark4>intimate</mark4><br>
Inner flying-garment of her slip in which she rides like the holy <mark4>ghost</mark4><br>
Of a virgin    sheds the long windsocks of her stockings    <mark4>absurd</mark4><br>
Brassiere    then feels the girdle required by regulations <mark4>squirming</mark4><br>
Off her: no longer monobuttocked    she feels the girdle flutter    <mark4>shake</mark4><br>
In her hand    and float    upward    her clothes rising off her <mark4>ascending</mark4><br>
Into cloud    and fights away from her head the last sharp dangerous <mark3>shoe</mark3><br>
Like a dumb bird    and now will drop in    soon    now will <mark4>drop</mark4><br>
<br>
In like this    the greatest thing that ever came to Kansas    down from <mark1>all</mark1><br>
Heights    all levels of American breath    layered in the lungs from the <mark4>frail</mark4><br>
Chill of space to the loam where extinction slumbers in corn tassels <mark4>thickly</mark4><br>
And breathes like rich farmers counting: will come along them <mark4>after</mark4><br>
Her last superhuman act    the last slow careful passing of her <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
All over her unharmed body    desired by every sleeper in his <mark4>dream:</mark4><br>
Boys finding for the first time their loins filled with heart's <mark4>blood</mark4><br>
Widowed farmers whose hands float under light covers to find <mark4>themselves</mark4><br>
Arisen at sunrise    the splendid position of blood unearthly <mark4>drawn</mark4><br>
Toward clouds    all feel something    pass over them as she <mark1>passes</mark1><br>
Her palms over her long legs    her small breasts    and deeply <mark4>between</mark4><br>
Her thighs    her hair shot loose from all pins    streaming in the <mark4>wind</mark4><br>
Of her body    let her come openly    trying at the last second to <mark4>land</mark4><br>
On her back    This is it    <mark4>this</mark4><br>
All those who find her <mark4>impressed</mark4><br>
In the soft loam    gone down    driven well into the image of her <mark1>body</mark1><br>
The furrows for miles flowing in upon her where she lies very <mark4>deep</mark4><br>
In her mortal outline    in the earth as it is in cloud    can tell <mark1>nothing</mark1><br>
But that she is there    inexplicable    unquestionable    and <mark4>remember</mark4><br>
That something broke in them as well    and began to live and die <mark4>more</mark4><br>
When they walked for no reason into their fields to where the whole <mark4>earth</mark4><br>
Caught her    interrupted her maiden flight    told her how to lie she <mark4>cannot</mark4><br>
Turn    go away    cannot move    cannot slide off it and assume <mark4>another</mark4><br>
Position    no sky-diver with any grin could save her    hold her in his <mark4>arms</mark4><br>
Plummet with her    unfold above her his wedding silks    she can no <mark4>longer</mark4><br>
Mark the rain with whirling women that take the place of a dead <mark4>wife</mark4><br>
Or the goddess in Norwegian farm girls    or all the back-breaking <mark4>whores</mark4><br>
Of Wichita. All the known air above her is not giving up quite <mark4>one</mark4><br>
Breath    it is all gone    and yet not dead    not anywhere <mark4>else</mark4><br>
Quite    lying still in the field on her back    sensing the <mark4>smells</mark4><br>
Of incessant growth try to lift her    a little sight left in the <mark4>corner</mark4><br>
Of one eye    fading    seeing something wave    lies <mark4>believing</mark4><br>
That she could have made it    at the best part of her brief <mark4>goddess</mark4><br>
State    to water    gone in headfirst    come out smiling    <mark4>invulnerable</mark4><br>
Girl in a bathing-suit ad    but she is lying like a sunbather at the <mark4>last</mark4><br>
Of moonlight    half-buried in her impact on the earth    not <mark4>far</mark4><br>
From a railroad trestle    a water tank    she could see if she <mark4>could</mark4><br>
Raise her head from her modest hole    with her clothes <mark4>beginning</mark4><br>
To come down all over Kansas    into bushes    on the dewy sixth <mark4>green</mark4><br>
Of a golf course    one shoe    her girdle coming down <mark4>fantastically</mark4><br>
On a clothesline, where it belongs    her blouse on a lightning <mark4>rod:</mark4><br>
<br>
Lies in the fields    in this field    on her broken back as though <mark4>on</mark4><br>
A cloud she cannot drop through    while farmers sleepwalk <mark4>without</mark4><br>
Their women from houses    a walk like falling toward the far <mark1>waters</mark1><br>
Of life    in moonlight    toward the dreamed eternal meaning of their <mark4>farms</mark4><br>
Toward the flowering of the harvest in their hands    that tragic <mark4>cost</mark4><br>
Feels herself go    go toward    go outward    breathes at last <mark4>fully</mark4><br>
Not    and tries    less    once    tries    tries    ah, <mark3>god--</mark3><br>
