Title : The Passionate Man's Pilgrimage <br>
Author : Sir Walter Ralegh <br><br>

[Supposed to be written by one at the point of death]<br>
Give me my scallop shell of <mark3>quiet,</mark3><br>
My staff of faith to walk <mark4>upon,</mark4><br>
My scrip of joy, immortal <mark3>diet,</mark3><br>
My bottle of <mark4>salvation,</mark4><br>
My gown of glory, hope's true <mark4>gage,</mark4><br>
And thus I'll take my <mark4>pilgrimage.</mark4><br>
<br>
Blood must be my body's <mark3>balmer,</mark3><br>
No other balm will there be <mark4>given,</mark4><br>
Whilst my soul, like a white <mark3>palmer,</mark3><br>
Travels to the land of <mark4>heaven;</mark4><br>
Over the silver <mark3>mountains,</mark3><br>
Where spring the nectar <mark3>fountains;</mark3><br>
And there I'll <mark3>kiss</mark3><br>
The bowl of <mark3>bliss,</mark3><br>
And drink my eternal <mark3>fill</mark3><br>
On every milken <mark3>hill.</mark3><br>
My soul will be a-dry <mark3>before,</mark3><br>
But after it will ne'er thirst <mark3>more;</mark3><br>
And by the happy blissful <mark3>way</mark3><br>
More peaceful pilgrims I shall <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
That have shook off their gowns of <mark3>clay,</mark3><br>
And go apparelled fresh like <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
I'll bring them <mark4>first</mark4><br>
To slake their <mark3>thirst,</mark3><br>
And then to taste those nectar suckets, <br>
At the clear <mark4>wells</mark4><br>
Where sweetness <mark3>dwells,</mark3><br>
Drawn up by saints in crystal <mark4>buckets.</mark4><br>
<br>
And when our bottles and all <mark3>we</mark3><br>
Are fill'd with <mark4>immortality,</mark4><br>
Then the holy paths we'll <mark4>travel,</mark4><br>
Strew'd with rubies thick as <mark3>gravel,</mark3><br>
Ceilings of <mark4>diamonds</mark4>, sapphire <mark4>floors,</mark4><br>
High walls of coral, and pearl <mark4>bowers.</mark4><br>
<br>
From thence to heaven's bribeless <mark4>hall</mark4><br>
Where no corrupted voices <mark3>brawl,</mark3><br>
No conscience molten into <mark3>gold,</mark3><br>
Nor forg'd accusers bought and <mark3>sold,</mark3><br>
No cause deferr'd, nor vain-spent <mark4>journey,</mark4><br>
For there Christ is the king's <mark3>attorney,</mark3><br>
Who pleads for all without <mark4>degrees,</mark4><br>
And he hath <mark4>angels</mark4>, but no <mark3>fees.</mark3><br>
When the grand twelve million <mark4>jury</mark4><br>
Of our sins and sinful <mark3>fury,</mark3><br>
'Gainst our souls black verdicts <mark5>give,</mark5><br>
Christ pleads his death, and then we <mark3>live.</mark3><br>
Be thou my speaker, taintless pleader, <br>
Unblotted lawyer, true proceeder, <br>
Thou movest salvation even for <mark4>alms,</mark4><br>
Not with a bribed lawyer's <mark3>palms.</mark3><br>
And this is my eternal <mark3>plea</mark3><br>
To him that made heaven, earth, and <mark3>sea,</mark3><br>
Seeing my flesh must die so <mark4>soon,</mark4><br>
And want a head to dine next <mark3>noon,</mark3><br>
Just at the stroke when my veins start and <mark4>spread,</mark4><br>
Set on my soul an everlasting <mark3>head.</mark3><br>
Then am I ready, like a palmer <mark4>fit,</mark4><br>
To tread those blest paths which before I <mark3>writ.</mark3><br>
