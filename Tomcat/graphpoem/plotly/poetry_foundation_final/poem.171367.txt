Title : Depression Glass <br>

It seemed those rose-pink <mark4>dishes</mark4><br>
she kept for special company   <br>
were always cold, brought down   <br>
from the shelf in jingling <mark4>stacks,</mark4><br>
the plates like the panes of <mark4>ice</mark4><br>
she broke from the water <mark4>bucket</mark4><br>
winter mornings, the flaring <mark4>cups</mark4><br>
like tulips that opened too <mark4>early</mark4><br>
and got bitten by frost. They <mark4>chilled</mark4><br>
the coffee no matter how <mark4>quickly</mark4><br>
you drank, while a <mark4>heavy</mark4><br>
everyday mug would have <mark4>kept</mark4><br>
a splash hot for the <mark4>better</mark4><br>
part of a conversation. It was <mark4>hard</mark4><br>
to hold up your end of the gossip   <br>
with your coffee cold, but it <mark4>was</mark4><br>
a special occasion, just the same,   <br>
to sit at her kitchen table <br>
and sip the bitter percolation <br>
of the past week's rumors from <mark1>cups</mark1><br>
it had taken a year to <mark4>collect</mark4><br>
at the grocery, with one piece free   <br>
for each five pounds of <mark4>flour.</mark4><br>
