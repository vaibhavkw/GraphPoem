Title : A Celebration of Charis: IV. Her Triumph <br>
Author : Ben Jonson <br><br>

See the chariot at hand here of <mark3>Love,</mark3><br>
Wherein my lady <mark5>rideth!</mark5><br>
Each that draws is a swan or a <mark3>dove,</mark3><br>
         And well the car Love guideth.<br>
As she goes, all hearts do <mark3>duty</mark3><br>
Unto her <mark3>beauty;</mark3><br>
And enamour'd, do wish, so they <mark3>might</mark3><br>
But enjoy such a <mark3>sight,</mark3><br>
That they still were to run by her <mark3>side,</mark3><br>
Through swords, through seas, whither she would <mark3>ride.</mark3><br>
<br>
Do but look on her eyes, they do <mark3>light</mark3><br>
         All that Love's world compriseth!<br>
Do but look on her hair, it is <mark3>bright</mark3><br>
         As Love's star when it riseth!<br>
Do but mark, her forehead's <mark4>smoother</mark4><br>
                Than words that soothe her;<br>
And from her arched brows, such a <mark3>grace</mark3><br>
Sheds itself through the <mark3>face</mark3><br>
As alone there triumphs to the <mark3>life</mark3><br>
All the gain, all the good, of the elements' <mark3>strife.</mark3><br>
<br>
Have you seen but a bright lily <mark3>grow,</mark3><br>
Before rude hands have touch'd <mark4>it?</mark4><br>
Ha' you mark'd but the fall o' the <mark3>snow</mark3><br>
Before the soil hath smutch'd <mark1>it?</mark1><br>
Ha' you felt the wool o' the <mark4>beaver?</mark4><br>
Or swan's down <mark4>ever?</mark4><br>
Or have smelt o' the bud o' the <mark4>briar?</mark4><br>
Or the nard in the <mark3>fire?</mark3><br>
Or have tasted the bag of the <mark3>bee?</mark3><br>
Oh so white! Oh so soft! Oh so sweet is <mark3>she!</mark3><br>
