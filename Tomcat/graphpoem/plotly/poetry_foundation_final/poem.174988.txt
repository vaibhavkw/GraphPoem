Title : Safe in their Alabaster Chambers (124) <br>
Author : Emily Dickinson <br><br>

Safe in their Alabaster Chambers <mark4>-</mark4><br>
Untouched by Morning - <br>
and untouched by noon <mark4>-</mark4><br>
Sleep the meek members of the <mark4>Resurrection,</mark4><br>
Rafter of Satin and Roof of Stone <mark4>-</mark4><br>
<br>
Grand go the <mark4>Years,</mark4><br>
In the Crescent above them -<br>
Worlds scoop their Arcs <mark4>-</mark4><br>
and Firmaments - row <mark3>-</mark3><br>
Diadems - drop - <br>
And Doges surrender -<br>
Soundless as <mark4>Dots,</mark4><br>
On a Disk of <mark3>Snow.</mark3><br>
