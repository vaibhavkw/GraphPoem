of the <mark4>furious</mark4><br>
<br>
Who take Today and jerk it out of <mark1>joint</mark1><br>
have made new underpinnings and a <mark3>Head.</mark3><br>
Blacktime is time for chimeful <br>
<br>
but they decree <mark3>a</mark3><br>
<br>
jagged chiming now. <br>
If there are flowers <mark4>flowers</mark4><br>
<br>
must come out to the road. <mark4>Rowdy!--</mark4><br>
knowing where wheels and people <mark1>are,</mark1><br>
knowing where whips and screams <mark1>are,</mark1><br>
knowing where deaths <mark1>are</mark1>, where the kind kills <mark1>are.</mark1><br>
As for that other kind of <mark4>kindness,</mark4><br>
<br>
if there is milk it must be <mark1>mindful.</mark1><br>
The milkofhumankindness must be <mark1>mindful</mark1><br>
as wily <mark4>wines.</mark4><br>
Must be fine <mark4>fury.</mark4><br>
Must be mega, must be main. <br>
Taking Today (to jerk it out of <mark1>joint)</mark1><br>
<br>
the hardheroic maim <mark4>the</mark4><br>
leechlike-as-usual who <mark4>use,</mark4><br>
adhere to, carp, and harm. <br>
And they <mark4>await,</mark4><br>
<br>
across the Changes and the spiraling <mark3>dead,</mark3><br>
our Black revival, our Black <mark3>vinegar,</mark3><br>
our hands, and our hot <mark4>blood.</mark4><br>
