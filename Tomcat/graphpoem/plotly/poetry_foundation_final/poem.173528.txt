Title : For Once, Then, Something <br>
Author : Robert Frost <br><br>

<br>
Others taunt me with having knelt at <mark5>well-curbs</mark5><br>
Always wrong to the light, so never <mark4>seeing</mark4><br>
Deeper down in the well than where the <mark4>water</mark4><br>
Gives me back in a shining surface <mark4>picture</mark4><br>
Me myself in the summer heaven godlike<br>
Looking out of a wreath of fern and cloud <mark4>puffs.</mark4><br>
Once, when trying with chin against a <mark5>well-curb,</mark5><br>
I discerned, as I thought, beyond the <mark1>picture,</mark1><br>
Through the picture, a something white, uncertain,<br>
Something more of the depths--and then I lost it.<br>
Water came to rebuke the too clear <mark1>water.</mark1><br>
One drop fell from a fern, and lo, a ripple<br>
Shook whatever it was lay there at bottom,<br>
Blurred it, blotted it out. What was that <mark4>whiteness?</mark4><br>
Truth? A pebble of quartz? For once, then, <mark4>something.</mark4><br>
