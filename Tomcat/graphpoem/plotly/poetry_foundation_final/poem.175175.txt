Title : Dupont's Round Fight (November, 1861) <br>
Author : Herman Melville <br><br>

In time and measure perfect moves <br>
All Art whose aim is <mark3>sure;</mark3><br>
Evolving rhyme and stars divine <br>
Have rules, and they <mark3>endure.</mark3><br>
<br>
Nor less the Fleet that warred for <mark4>Right,</mark4><br>
And, warring so, <mark4>prevailed,</mark4><br>
In geometric beauty <mark4>curved,</mark4><br>
And in an orbit <mark4>sailed.</mark4><br>
<br>
The rebel at Port Royal <mark4>felt</mark4><br>
      The Unity overawe, <br>
And rued the spell. A type was <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
      And victory of LAW. <br>
