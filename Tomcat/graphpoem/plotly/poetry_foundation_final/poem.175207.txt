Title : Solitude <br>
Author : Ella Wheeler Wilcox <br><br>

Laugh, and the world laughs with <mark1>you;</mark1><br>
Weep, and you weep <mark3>alone;</mark3><br>
For the sad old earth must borrow its mirth,<br>
But has trouble enough of its <mark3>own.</mark3><br>
Sing, and the hills will <mark4>answer;</mark4><br>
Sigh, it is lost on the <mark3>air;</mark3><br>
The echoes bound to a joyful <mark4>sound,</mark4><br>
But shrink from voicing <mark3>care.</mark3><br>
<br>
Rejoice, and men will seek <mark1>you;</mark1><br>
Grieve, and they turn and <mark3>go;</mark3><br>
They want full measure of all your <mark4>pleasure,</mark4><br>
But they do not need your <mark3>woe.</mark3><br>
Be glad, and your friends are many;<br>
Be sad, and you lose them <mark3>all,--</mark3><br>
There are none to decline your nectared <mark4>wine,</mark4><br>
But alone you must drink life's <mark3>gall.</mark3><br>
<br>
Feast, and your halls are <mark4>crowded;</mark4><br>
Fast, and the world goes <mark3>by.</mark3><br>
Succeed and <mark3>give</mark3>, and it helps you <mark3>live,</mark3><br>
But no man can help you <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
There is room in the halls of <mark1>pleasure</mark1><br>
For a large and lordly <mark4>train,</mark4><br>
But one by one we must all file <mark4>on</mark4><br>
Through the narrow aisles of <mark4>pain.</mark4><br>
