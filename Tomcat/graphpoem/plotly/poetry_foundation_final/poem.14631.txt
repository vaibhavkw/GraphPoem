Title : Seele im Raum<br>
Author : Randall Jarrell<br><br>

It sat between my husband and my <mark1>children.</mark1><br>
A place was set for it--a plate of <mark4>greens.</mark4><br>
It had been there: I had seen <mark1>it</mark1><br>
But not somehow--but this was like a <mark4>dream--</mark4><br>
Not seen it so that I knew I saw <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
It was as if I could not know I saw <mark1>it</mark1><br>
Because I had never once in all my <mark4>life</mark4><br>
Not seen it. It was an <mark4>eland.</mark4><br>
An eland! That is why the <mark1>children</mark1><br>
Would ask my husband, for a joke, at <mark4>Christmas:</mark4><br>
"Father, is it Donner?" He would say, "No, <mark4>Blitzen."</mark4><br>
It had been there always. Now we put <mark4>silver</mark4><br>
At its place at meals, fed it the same <mark4>food</mark4><br>
We ourselves ate, and said nothing. Many <mark4>times</mark4><br>
When it breathed heavily (when it had <mark4>tried</mark4><br>
A long useless time to speak) and reached to <mark1>me</mark1><br>
So that I touched it--of a different <mark4>size</mark4><br>
And order of being, like the live hard <mark3>side</mark3><br>
Of a horse's neck when you pat the <mark4>horse--</mark4><br>
And looked with its great melting tearless <mark3>eyes</mark3><br>
Fringed with a few coarse wire-like <mark4>lashes</mark4><br>
Into my eyes, and whispered to <mark1>me</mark1><br>
So that my eyes turned backward in their <mark4>sockets</mark4><br>
And they said <mark1>nothing--</mark1><br>
many <mark1>times</mark1><br>
I have known, when they said <mark1>nothing,</mark1><br>
That it did not exist. If they had <mark4>heard</mark4><br>
They could not have been silent. And yet they <mark1>heard;</mark1><br>
Heard many times what I have <mark4>spoken</mark4><br>
When it could no longer speak, but only <mark1>breathe--</mark1><br>
When I could no longer speak, but only <mark1>breathe.</mark1><br>
<br>
And, after some years, the others <mark4>came</mark4><br>
And took it from me--it was ill, they told <mark1>me--</mark1><br>
And cured it, they wrote me: my whole <mark4>city</mark4><br>
Sent me cards lilac-branches, <mark4>mourning</mark4><br>
As I had <mark4>mourned--</mark4><br>
and I was <mark4>standing</mark4><br>
By a grave in flowers, by dyed rolls of <mark4>turf,</mark4><br>
And a canvas marquee the last brown of <mark4>earth.</mark4><br>
<br>
It is <mark4>over.</mark4><br>
It is over so long that I begin to <mark4>think</mark4><br>
That it did not exist, that I have <mark4>never--</mark4><br>
And my son says, one morning, from the <mark4>paper:</mark4><br>
"An eland. Look, an <mark1>eland!"</mark1><br>
--It was <mark1>so.</mark1><br>
<br>
Today, in a German dictionary, I saw elend <br>
And the heart in my breast turned over, it <mark4>was--</mark4><br>
<br>
It was a word one translates <mark4>wretched.</mark4><br>
<br>
It is as if someone remembered <mark4>saying:</mark4><br>
"This is an antimacassar that I grew from <mark4>seed,"</mark4><br>
And this were <mark5>true.</mark5><br>
And, <mark4>truly,</mark4><br>
One could not wish for anything more strange-- <br>
For anything more. And yet it wasn't interesting .  .  <mark4>.</mark4><br>
--It was worse than impossible, it was a <mark4>joke.</mark4><br>
<br>
And yet when it <mark1>was</mark1>, I <mark1>was--</mark1><br>
Even to think that I once <mark4>thought</mark4><br>
That I could see it to feel the <mark4>sweat</mark4><br>
Like needles at my hair-roots, I am <mark4>blind</mark4><br>
<br>
--It was not even a <mark1>joke</mark1>, not even a <mark1>joke.</mark1><br>
Yet how can I believe it? Or believe that I <br>
Owned it, a husband, children? Is my voice the <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
Of that skin of being--of what owns, is <mark4>owned</mark4><br>
In honor or dishonor, that is borne and <mark4>bears--</mark4><br>
Or of that raw thing, the being inside <mark1>it</mark1><br>
That has neither a wife, a <mark4>husband</mark4>, nor a <mark4>child</mark4><br>
But goes at last as naked from this <mark4>world</mark4><br>
As it was born into <mark1>it--</mark1><br>
<br>
And the eland comes and grazes on its grave.   <br>
<br>
This is <mark4>senseless?</mark4><br>
Shall I make sense or shall I tell the <mark4>truth?</mark4><br>
Choose either--I cannot do <mark4>both.</mark4><br>
<br>
I tell myself that. And yet it is not <mark1>so,</mark1><br>
And what I say afterwards will not be <mark1>so:</mark1><br>
To be at all is to be <mark4>wrong.</mark4><br>
Being is being <mark4>old</mark4><br>
And saying, almost comfortably, across a table   <br>
<br>
from what I don't <mark3>know--</mark3><br>
in a <mark1>voice</mark1><br>
Rich with a kind of longing <mark4>satisfaction:</mark4><br>
"To own an eland! That's what I call <mark1>life!"</mark1><br>
