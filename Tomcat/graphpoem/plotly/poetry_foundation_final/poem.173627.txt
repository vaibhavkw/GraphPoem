Title : The Elixir <br>
Author : George Herbert <br><br>

Teach me, my God and <mark4>King,</mark4><br>
In all things Thee to <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
And what I do in <mark4>anything</mark4><br>
To do it as for <mark3>Thee.</mark3><br>
<br>
         Not rudely, as a beast, <br>
To run into an <mark4>action;</mark4><br>
But still to make Thee prepossest, <br>
And give it his <mark4>perfection.</mark4><br>
<br>
A man that looks on <mark3>glass,</mark3><br>
         On it may stay his eye; <br>
Or if he pleaseth, through it <mark3>pass,</mark3><br>
         And then the heav'n espy. <br>
<br>
All may of Thee <mark3>partake:</mark3><br>
Nothing can be so <mark4>mean,</mark4><br>
Which with his tincture--"for Thy <mark3>sake"--</mark3><br>
Will not grow bright and <mark3>clean.</mark3><br>
<br>
A servant with this <mark3>clause</mark3><br>
Makes drudgery <mark4>divine:</mark4><br>
Who sweeps a room as for Thy <mark3>laws,</mark3><br>
Makes that and th' action <mark3>fine.</mark3><br>
<br>
This is the famous <mark4>stone</mark4><br>
That turneth all to <mark3>gold;</mark3><br>
For that which God doth touch and <mark3>own</mark3><br>
Cannot for less be <mark3>told.</mark3><br>
