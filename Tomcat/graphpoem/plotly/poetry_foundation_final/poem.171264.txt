Title : Legacy <br>
Author : Amiri Baraka <br><br>

(For Blues People)<br>
In the south, sleeping <mark4>against</mark4><br>
the drugstore, growling under   <br>
the trucks and stoves, <mark4>stumbling</mark4><br>
through and over the cluttered <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
of early mysterious night. <mark4>Frowning</mark4><br>
drunk waving moving a hand or lash.   <br>
Dancing kneeling reaching out, <mark4>letting</mark4><br>
a hand rest in shadows. <mark4>Squatting</mark4><br>
to drink or pee. Stretching to climb   <br>
pulling themselves onto horses <mark4>near</mark4><br>
where there was sea (the old <mark4>songs</mark4><br>
lead you to believe). Riding <mark4>out</mark4><br>
from this town, to another, <mark4>where</mark4><br>
it is also black. Down a road <br>
where people are asleep. <mark4>Towards</mark4><br>
the moon or the shadows of <mark4>houses.</mark4><br>
Towards the songs' pretended sea.<br>
