Title : Follow Your Saint <br>
Author : Thomas Campion <br><br>

Follow your <mark4>saint</mark4>, follow with accents <mark4>sweet;</mark4><br>
Haste you, sad notes, fall at her flying <mark3>feet.</mark3><br>
There, wrapp'd in cloud of sorrow, pity <mark4>move,</mark4><br>
And tell the ravisher of my soul I perish for her <mark4>love:</mark4><br>
But if she scorns my never-ceasing <mark3>pain,</mark3><br>
Then burst with sighing in her sight and ne'er return <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
<br>
All that I sung still to her praise did <mark3>tend,</mark3><br>
Still she was first; still she my songs did <mark3>end;</mark3><br>
Yet she my love and music both doth fly,<br>
The music that her echo is and beauty's sympathy.<br>
Then let my notes pursue her scornful <mark4>flight:</mark4><br>
It shall suffice that they were breath'd and died for her <mark3>delight.</mark3><br>
