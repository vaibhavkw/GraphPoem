Title : Fie, Pleasure, Fie! <br>
Author : George Gascoigne <br><br>

Fie pleasure, fie! thou cloyest me with <mark3>delight,</mark3><br>
Thou fill'st my mouth with sweetmeats overmuch; <br>
I wallow still in joy both day and <mark3>night:</mark3><br>
I deem, I dream, I do, I taste, I touch, <br>
No thing but all that smells of perfect <mark3>bliss;</mark3><br>
Fie pleasure, fie! I cannot like of <mark3>this.</mark3><br>
<br>
To taste (sometimes) a bait of bitter <mark3>gall,</mark3><br>
To drink a draught of sour ale (some <mark3>season)</mark3><br>
To eat brown bread with homely hands in <mark3>hall,</mark3><br>
Doth much increase men's appetites, by <mark3>reason,</mark3><br>
And makes the sweet more sugar'd that <mark3>ensues,</mark3><br>
Since minds of men do still seek after <mark3>news.</mark3><br>
<br>
The pamper'd horse is seldom seen in <mark3>breath,</mark3><br>
Whose manger makes his grace (oftimes) to <mark4>melt;</mark4><br>
The crammed fowl comes quickly to his <mark3>death;</mark3><br>
Such colds they catch in hottest haps that swelt; <br>
And I (much like) in pleasure scawled <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
Do fear to starve although I feed my <mark3>fill.</mark3><br>
<br>
It might suffice that Love hath built his <mark3>bower</mark3><br>
Between my lady's lively shining <mark4>eyes;</mark4><br>
It were enough that beauty's fading <mark3>flower</mark3><br>
Grows ever fresh with her in heavenly <mark3>wise;</mark3><br>
It had been well that she were fair of <mark4>face,</mark4><br>
And yet not rob all other dames of <mark3>grace.</mark3><br>
<br>
To muse in mind, how wise, how fair, how <mark4>good,</mark4><br>
How brave, how frank, how courteous, and how <mark3>true</mark3><br>
My lady is, doth but inflame my <mark4>blood</mark4><br>
With humours such as bid my health <mark3>adieu;</mark3><br>
Since hap always when it is clomb on <mark3>high,</mark3><br>
Doth fall full low, though erst it reach'd the <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
<br>
Lo, pleasure, lo! lo thus I lead a <mark3>life</mark3><br>
That laughs for joy, and trembleth oft for <mark4>dread;</mark4><br>
Thy pangs are such as call for change's <mark3>knife</mark3><br>
To cut the twist, or else to stretch the <mark3>thread,</mark3><br>
Which holds yfeer the bundle of my <mark1>bliss:</mark1><br>
Fie, pleasure, fie! I dare not trust to <mark1>this.</mark1><br>
