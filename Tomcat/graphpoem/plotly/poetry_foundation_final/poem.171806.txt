Title : Preparation <br>
Author : Ellen Bryant Voigt <br><br>

The Bone-man lives in a stucco   <br>
house. He ticks his <mark4>heels</mark4><br>
<br>
on the cold terrazzo floor.   <br>
He parks his ragtruck <br>
<br>
in the yard, instructs his crew   <br>
on the white <mark4>telephone.</mark4><br>
<br>
I am training my dog <br>
to attack the red-capped <mark4>hunter</mark4><br>
<br>
bearing his long package. <br>
I am training the tethered jay <br>
<br>
to cry out <mark4>against</mark4><br>
the killer who cracks the latch. <br>
<br>
On the open map, the road <br>
to my house bulges like a <mark4>vein.</mark4><br>
<br>
He takes a train, he rents   <br>
a car, he lurches <mark4>in</mark4><br>
<br>
with an open fly. Sweet Eve   <br>
was just the Farmer's <mark4>Daughter,</mark4><br>
<br>
he wooed her with a wormy apple.   <br>
He's a dirty joke, <mark4>he's</mark4><br>
<br>
always everybody's <mark4>last</mark4><br>
<mark4>lover</mark4>, he's a <mark4>regular</mark4><br>
<br>
can of worms--you wry Medusa, <br>
I am a mongoose staring you <mark4>down.</mark4><br>
