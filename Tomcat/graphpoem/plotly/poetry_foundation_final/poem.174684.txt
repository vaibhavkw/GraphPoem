Title : Walking <br>
Author : Thomas Traherne <br><br>

To walk abroad <mark4>is</mark4>, not with <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
But thoughts, the fields to see and <mark3>prize;</mark3><br>
Else may the silent <mark3>feet,</mark3><br>
Like logs of <mark3>wood,</mark3><br>
Move up and down, and see no <mark3>good</mark3><br>
Nor joy nor glory <mark3>meet.</mark3><br>
<br>
Ev'n carts and wheels their place do <mark3>change,</mark3><br>
But cannot see, though very <mark3>strange</mark3><br>
The glory that is <mark3>by;</mark3><br>
Dead puppets <mark3>may</mark3><br>
Move in the bright and glorious <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
Yet not behold the <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
<br>
And are not men than they more <mark4>blind,</mark4><br>
Who having eyes yet never <mark3>find</mark3><br>
The bliss in which they <mark4>move;</mark4><br>
Like statues <mark4>dead</mark4><br>
They up and down are <mark4>carried</mark4><br>
Yet never see nor <mark4>love.</mark4><br>
<br>
To walk is by a thought to <mark3>go;</mark3><br>
To move in spirit to and <mark3>fro;</mark3><br>
To mind the good we <mark3>see;</mark3><br>
To taste the <mark3>sweet;</mark3><br>
Observing all the things we <mark1>meet</mark1><br>
How choice and rich they <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
<br>
To note the beauty of the <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
And golden fields of corn <mark3>survey;</mark3><br>
Admire each pretty <mark4>flow'r</mark4><br>
With its sweet <mark3>smell;</mark3><br>
To praise their Maker, and to <mark3>tell</mark3><br>
The marks of his great <mark4>pow'r.</mark4><br>
<br>
To fly abroad like active <mark4>bees,</mark4><br>
Among the hedges and the <mark3>trees,</mark3><br>
To cull the dew that <mark4>lies</mark4><br>
On ev'ry <mark4>blade,</mark4><br>
From ev'ry blossom; till we <mark3>lade</mark3><br>
Our <mark4>minds</mark4>, as they their <mark3>thighs.</mark3><br>
<br>
Observe those rich and glorious <mark4>things,</mark4><br>
The rivers, meadows, <mark4>woods</mark4>, and <mark3>springs,</mark3><br>
The fructifying <mark3>sun;</mark3><br>
To note from <mark3>far</mark3><br>
The rising of each twinkling <mark3>star</mark3><br>
For us his race to <mark3>run.</mark3><br>
<br>
A little child these well <mark4>perceives,</mark4><br>
Who, tumbling in green grass and <mark3>leaves,</mark3><br>
May rich as kings be <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
But there's a <mark4>sight</mark4><br>
Which perfect manhood may <mark3>delight,</mark3><br>
To which we shall be <mark4>brought.</mark4><br>
<br>
While in those pleasant paths we <mark3>talk,</mark3><br>
'Tis that tow'rds which at last we <mark3>walk;</mark3><br>
For we may by <mark4>degrees</mark4><br>
Wisely <mark4>proceed</mark4><br>
Pleasures of love and praise to <mark3>heed,</mark3><br>
From viewing herbs and <mark1>trees.</mark1><br>
