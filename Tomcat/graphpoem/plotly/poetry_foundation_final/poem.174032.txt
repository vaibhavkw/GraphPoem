FLAVIA. THE wretched FLAVIA on her couch <mark5>reclin'd,</mark5><br>
Thus breath'd the anguish of a wounded mind <mark5>;</mark5><br>
A glass revers'd in her right hand she <mark3>bore,</mark3><br>
For now she shun'd the face she sought <mark3>before.</mark3><br>
<br>
' How am I chang'd ! alas ! how am I <mark3>grown</mark3><br>
' A frightful spectre, to myself unknown <mark3>!</mark3><br>
' Where's my Complexion ? where the radiant <mark4>Bloom,</mark4><br>
' That promis'd happiness for Years to come <mark4>?</mark4><br>
' Then with what pleasure I this face survey'd <mark3>!</mark3><br>
' To look once more, my visits oft delay'd <mark3>!</mark3><br>
' Charm'd with the view, a fresher red would <mark4>rise,</mark4><br>
' And a new life shot sparkling from my eyes <mark3>!</mark3><br>
<br>
' Ah ! faithless glass, my wonted bloom <mark3>restore;</mark3><br>
' Alas ! I rave, that bloom is now no more <mark3>!</mark3><br>
' The greatest good the GODS on men <mark3>bestow,</mark3><br>
' Ev'n youth itself, to me is useless <mark1>now.</mark1><br>
' There was a time, (oh ! that I could forget <mark4>!)</mark4><br>
' When opera-tickets pour'd before my feet <mark4>;</mark4><br>
' And at the ring, where brightest beauties <mark4>shine,</mark4><br>
' The earliest cherries of the spring were <mark3>mine.</mark3><br>
' Witness, O Lilly ; and thou, Motteux, <mark3>tell</mark3><br>
' How much Japan these eyes have made ye <mark3>sell.</mark3><br>
' With what contempt ye you saw me oft <mark3>despise</mark3><br>
' The humble offer of the raffled prize <mark3>;</mark3><br>
' For at the raffle still the prize I <mark1>bore,</mark1><br>
' With scorn rejected, or with triumph wore <mark3>!</mark3><br>
' Now beauty's fled, and presents are no more <mark1>!</mark1><br>
<br>
' For me the Patriot has the house <mark5>forsook,</mark5><br>
' And left debates to catch a passing look <mark3>:</mark3><br>
' For me the Soldier has soft verses writ <mark4>;</mark4><br>
' For me the Beau has aim'd to be a <mark3>Wit.</mark3><br>
' For me the Wit to nonsense was betray'd <mark4>;</mark4><br>
' The Gamester has for me his dun <mark1>delay'd,</mark1><br>
' And overseen the card, I would have <mark3>play'd.</mark3><br>
' The bold and haughty by success made <mark4>vain,</mark4><br>
' Aw'd by my eyes has trembled to <mark3>complain:</mark3><br>
' The bashful 'squire touch'd by a wish <mark1>unknown,</mark1><br>
' Has dar'd to speak with spirit not his own <mark3>;</mark3><br>
' Fir'd by one wish, all did alike adore <mark3>;</mark3><br>
' Now beauty's fled, and lovers are no <mark1>more!</mark1><br>
<br>
' As round the room I turn my weeping <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
' New unaffected scenes of sorrow rise <mark1>!</mark1><br>
' Far from my sight that killing picture <mark4>bear,</mark4><br>
' The face disfigure, and the canvas tear <mark3>!</mark3><br>
' That picture which with pride I us'd to <mark3>show,</mark3><br>
' The lost resemblance but upbraids me <mark1>now.</mark1><br>
' And thou, my toilette! where I oft have <mark4>sat,</mark4><br>
' While hours unheeded pass'd in deep <mark4>debate,</mark4><br>
' How curls should fall, or where a patch to place <mark5>:</mark5><br>
' If blue or scarlet best became my <mark3>face;</mark3><br>
' Now on some happier nymph thy aid bestow <mark1>;</mark1><br>
' On fairer heads, ye useless jewels glow <mark3>!</mark3><br>
' No borrow'd lustre can my charms restore <mark1>;</mark1><br>
' Beauty is fled, and dress is now no more <mark1>!</mark1><br>
<br>
' Ye meaner beauties, I permit ye shine <mark1>;</mark1><br>
' Go, triumph in the hearts that once were mine <mark1>;</mark1><br>
' But midst your triumphs with confusion <mark3>know,</mark3><br>
' 'Tis to my ruin all your arms ye <mark3>owe.</mark3><br>
' Would pitying Heav'n restore my wonted <mark4>mien,</mark4><br>
' Ye still might move unthought-of and <mark3>unseen.</mark3><br>
' But oh ! how vain, how wretched is the <mark4>boast</mark4><br>
' Of beauty faded, and of empire lost <mark4>!</mark4><br>
' What now is left but weeping, to <mark3>deplore</mark3><br>
' My beauty fled, and empire now no more <mark1>!</mark1><br>
<br>
' Ye, cruel Chymists, what with-held your aid <mark4>!</mark4><br>
' Could no pomatums save a trembling maid <mark3>?</mark3><br>
' How false and trifling is that art you boast <mark1>;</mark1><br>
' No art can give me back my beauty <mark1>lost.</mark1><br>
' In tears, surrounded by my friends I <mark3>lay,</mark3><br>
' Mask'd o'er and trembled at the sight of <mark3>day;</mark3><br>
' MIRMILLO came my fortune to <mark1>deplore,</mark1><br>
' (A golden headed cane, well carv'd he <mark1>bore)</mark1><br>
' Cordials, he cried, my spirits must restore <mark1>:</mark1><br>
' Beauty is fled, and spirit is no more <mark1>!</mark1><br>
<br>
' GALEN, the grave ; officious SQUIRT was <mark4>there,</mark4><br>
' With fruitless grief and unavailing care <mark3>:</mark3><br>
' MACHAON too, the great MACHAON, <mark4>known</mark4><br>
' By his red cloak and his superior frown <mark4>;</mark4><br>
' And why, he cry'd, this grief and this despair <mark3>?</mark3><br>
' You shall again be well, again be fair <mark3>;</mark3><br>
' Believe my oath ; (with that an oath he <mark4>swore)</mark4><br>
' False was his oath ; my beauty is no more <mark1>!</mark1><br>
<br>
' Cease, hapless maid, no more thy tale <mark3>pursue,</mark3><br>
' Forsake mankind, and bid the world adieu <mark3>!</mark3><br>
' Monarchs and beauties rule with equal sway <mark3>;</mark3><br>
' All strive to serve, and glory to obey <mark3>:</mark3><br>
' Alike unpitied when depos'd they grow <mark3>;</mark3><br>
' Men mock the idol of their former <mark3>vow.</mark3><br>
<br>
' Adieu ! ye parks ! -- in some obscure <mark4>recess,</mark4><br>
' Where gentle streams will weep at my <mark3>distress,</mark3><br>
' Where no false friend will in my grief take <mark4>part,</mark4><br>
' And mourn my ruin with a joyful heart <mark3>;</mark3><br>
' There let me live in some deserted <mark1>place,</mark1><br>
' There hide in shades this lost inglorious <mark1>face.</mark1><br>
' Ye, operas, circles, I no more must view <mark3>!</mark3><br>
' My toilette, patches, all the world <mark1>adieu!</mark1><br>
