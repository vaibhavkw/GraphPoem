Title : Tithonus <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

The woods decay, the woods decay and <mark4>fall,</mark4><br>
The vapours weep their burthen to the <mark4>ground,</mark4><br>
Man comes and tills the field and lies <mark4>beneath,</mark4><br>
And after many a summer dies the <mark4>swan.</mark4><br>
Me only cruel <mark1>immortality</mark1><br>
Consumes: I wither slowly in thine <mark4>arms,</mark4><br>
Here at the quiet limit of the <mark4>world,</mark4><br>
A white-hair'd shadow roaming like a <mark4>dream</mark4><br>
The ever-silent spaces of the <mark4>East,</mark4><br>
Far-folded mists, and gleaming halls of <mark4>morn.</mark4><br>
<br>
Alas! for this gray shadow, once a <mark4>man--</mark4><br>
So glorious in his beauty and thy <mark4>choice,</mark4><br>
Who madest him thy chosen, that he <mark4>seem'd</mark4><br>
To his great heart none other than a <mark4>God!</mark4><br>
I ask'd thee, 'Give me <mark1>immortality.'</mark1><br>
Then didst thou grant mine asking with a <mark4>smile,</mark4><br>
Like wealthy men, who care not how they <mark4>give.</mark4><br>
But thy strong Hours indignant work'd their <mark4>wills,</mark4><br>
And beat me down and marr'd and wasted me, <br>
And tho' they could not end me, left me <mark4>maim'd</mark4><br>
To dwell in presence of immortal <mark4>youth,</mark4><br>
Immortal age beside immortal <mark1>youth,</mark1><br>
And all I was, in ashes. Can thy <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
Thy beauty, make amends, tho' even now, <br>
Close over us, the silver star, thy <mark4>guide,</mark4><br>
Shines in those tremulous eyes that fill with <mark4>tears</mark4><br>
To hear me? Let me go: take back thy <mark4>gift:</mark4><br>
Why should a man desire in any <mark3>way</mark3><br>
To vary from the kindly race of <mark4>men</mark4><br>
Or pass beyond the goal of <mark4>ordinance</mark4><br>
Where all should pause, as is most meet for <mark4>all?</mark4><br>
<br>
A soft air fans the cloud apart; there <mark4>comes</mark4><br>
A glimpse of that dark world where I was <mark4>born.</mark4><br>
Once more the old mysterious glimmer <mark4>steals</mark4><br>
From thy pure brows, and from thy shoulders <mark4>pure,</mark4><br>
And bosom beating with a heart <mark4>renew'd.</mark4><br>
Thy cheek begins to redden thro' the <mark4>gloom,</mark4><br>
Thy sweet eyes brighten slowly close to <mark4>mine,</mark4><br>
Ere yet they blind the stars, and the wild <mark4>team</mark4><br>
Which love thee, yearning for thy yoke, <mark4>arise,</mark4><br>
And shake the darkness from their loosen'd <mark4>manes,</mark4><br>
And beat the twilight into flakes of <mark4>fire.</mark4><br>
<br>
Lo! ever thus thou growest <mark4>beautiful</mark4><br>
In silence, then before thine answer <mark4>given</mark4><br>
Departest, and thy tears are on my cheek. <br>
<br>
Why wilt thou ever scare me with thy <mark1>tears,</mark1><br>
And make me tremble lest a saying <mark4>learnt,</mark4><br>
In days far-off, on that dark earth, be true? <br>
'The Gods themselves cannot recall their <mark4>gifts.'</mark4><br>
<br>
Ay me! ay me! with what another <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
In days far-off, and with what other <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
I used to watch--if I be he that <mark4>watch'd--</mark4><br>
The lucid outline forming round thee; saw <br>
The dim curls kindle into sunny <mark4>rings;</mark4><br>
Changed with thy mystic change, and felt my <mark4>blood</mark4><br>
Glow with the glow that slowly crimson'd <mark1>all</mark1><br>
Thy presence and thy portals, while I <mark3>lay,</mark3><br>
Mouth, forehead, eyelids, growing <mark4>dewy-warm</mark4><br>
With kisses balmier than half-opening <mark4>buds</mark4><br>
Of April, and could hear the lips that <mark4>kiss'd</mark4><br>
Whispering I knew not what of wild and <mark4>sweet,</mark4><br>
Like that strange song I heard Apollo sing, <br>
While Ilion like a mist rose into <mark4>towers.</mark4><br>
<br>
Yet hold me not for ever in thine <mark1>East:</mark1><br>
How can my nature longer mix with <mark4>thine?</mark4><br>
Coldly thy rosy shadows bathe me, <mark4>cold</mark4><br>
Are all thy lights, and cold my wrinkled <mark4>feet</mark4><br>
Upon thy glimmering thresholds, when the <mark4>steam</mark4><br>
Floats up from those dim fields about the <mark4>homes</mark4><br>
Of happy men that have the power to die, <br>
And grassy barrows of the happier <mark4>dead.</mark4><br>
Release me, and restore me to the <mark1>ground;</mark1><br>
Thou seest all things, thou wilt see my <mark4>grave:</mark4><br>
Thou wilt renew thy beauty morn by <mark1>morn;</mark1><br>
I earth in earth forget these empty <mark4>courts,</mark4><br>
And thee returning on thy silver <mark4>wheels.</mark4><br>
