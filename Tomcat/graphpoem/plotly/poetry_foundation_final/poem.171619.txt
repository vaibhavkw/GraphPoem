Title : "Hope" is the thing with feathers - (314) <br>
Author : Emily Dickinson <br><br>

"Hope" is the thing with feathers <mark4>-</mark4><br>
That perches in the soul <mark4>-</mark4><br>
And sings the tune without the words <mark4>-</mark4><br>
And never stops - at all <mark4>-</mark4><br>
<br>
And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard <mark3>-</mark3><br>
And sore must be the storm <mark3>-</mark3><br>
That could abash the little <mark3>Bird</mark3><br>
That kept so many warm <mark3>-</mark3><br>
<br>
I've heard it in the chillest land <mark4>-</mark4><br>
And on the strangest Sea <mark3>-</mark3><br>
Yet - never - in Extremity, <br>
It asked a crumb - of <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
