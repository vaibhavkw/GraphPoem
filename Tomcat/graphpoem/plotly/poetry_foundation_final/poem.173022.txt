Title : Meeting at Night <br>
Author : Robert Browning <br><br>

<br>
The grey sea and the long black <mark3>land;</mark3><br>
And the yellow half-moon large and low; <br>
And the startled little waves that <mark3>leap</mark3><br>
In fiery ringlets from their <mark3>sleep,</mark3><br>
As I gain the cove with pushing prow, <br>
And quench its speed i' the slushy <mark3>sand.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then a mile of warm sea-scented <mark4>beach;</mark4><br>
Three fields to cross till a farm <mark3>appears;</mark3><br>
A tap at the pane, the quick sharp <mark4>scratch</mark4><br>
And blue spurt of a lighted <mark3>match,</mark3><br>
And a voice less loud, thro' its joys and <mark3>fears,</mark3><br>
Than the two hearts beating each to <mark4>each!</mark4><br>
