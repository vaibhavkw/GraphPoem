Title : Saint Francis and the Sow <br>
Author : Galway Kinnell <br><br>

The <mark4>bud</mark4><br>
stands for all things, <br>
even for those things that don't <mark1>flower,</mark1><br>
for everything flowers, from within, of <mark1>self-blessing;</mark1><br>
though sometimes it is <mark4>necessary</mark4><br>
to reteach a thing its <mark5>loveliness,</mark5><br>
to put a hand on its <mark3>brow</mark3><br>
of the <mark1>flower</mark1><br>
and retell it in words and in <mark1>touch</mark1><br>
it is <mark4>lovely</mark4><br>
until it flowers again from within, of <mark1>self-blessing;</mark1><br>
as Saint Francis <br>
put his hand on the creased <mark4>forehead</mark4><br>
of the sow, and told her in words and in <mark1>touch</mark1><br>
blessings of earth on the <mark1>sow</mark1>, and the <mark3>sow</mark3><br>
began remembering all down her thick length,   <br>
from the earthen snout all the way <br>
through the fodder and slops to the spiritual curl of the tail,   <br>
from the hard spininess spiked out from the spine   <br>
down through the great broken heart <br>
to the sheer blue milken dreaminess spurting and <mark4>shuddering</mark4><br>
from the fourteen teats into the fourteen mouths sucking and blowing beneath them: <br>
the long, perfect loveliness of <mark1>sow.</mark1><br>
