Title : The Cold Heaven <br>
Author : William Butler Yeats <br><br>

Suddenly I saw the cold and rook-delighting <mark4>heaven</mark4><br>
That seemed as though ice burned and was but the more <mark4>ice,</mark4><br>
And thereupon imagination and heart were <mark4>driven</mark4><br>
So wild that every casual thought of that and <mark4>this</mark4><br>
Vanished, and left but memories, that should be out of <mark4>season</mark4><br>
With the hot blood of youth, of love crossed long <mark3>ago;</mark3><br>
And I took all the blame out of all sense and <mark3>reason,</mark3><br>
Until I cried and trembled and rocked to and <mark3>fro,</mark3><br>
Riddled with light. Ah! when the ghost begins to <mark4>quicken,</mark4><br>
Confusion of the death-bed over, is it <mark4>sent</mark4><br>
Out naked on the roads, as the books say, and <mark3>stricken</mark3><br>
By the injustice of the skies for <mark4>punishment?</mark4><br>
