Title : The Ballad of the Lonely Masturbator <br>
Author : Anne Sexton <br><br>

The end of the affair is always <mark3>death.</mark3><br>
She's my workshop. Slippery <mark2>eye,</mark2><br>
out of the tribe of myself my <mark3>breath</mark3><br>
finds you gone. I <mark3>horrify</mark3><br>
those who stand by. I am <mark3>fed.</mark3><br>
At night, alone, I marry the <mark3>bed.</mark3><br>
<br>
Finger to finger, now she's <mark3>mine.</mark3><br>
She's not too far. She's my <mark4>encounter.</mark4><br>
I beat her like a bell. I <mark3>recline</mark3><br>
in the bower where you used to mount her.   <br>
You borrowed me on the flowered <mark3>spread.</mark3><br>
At night, alone, I marry the <mark1>bed.</mark1><br>
<br>
Take for instance this night, my <mark3>love,</mark3><br>
that every single couple puts <mark4>together</mark4><br>
with a joint overturning, beneath, <mark3>above,</mark3><br>
the abundant two on sponge and <mark3>feather,</mark3><br>
kneeling and pushing, head to <mark3>head.</mark3><br>
At night alone, I marry the <mark1>bed.</mark1><br>
<br>
I break out of my body this <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
an annoying miracle. Could <mark2>I</mark2><br>
put the dream market on <mark3>display?</mark3><br>
I am spread out. I <mark3>crucify.</mark3><br>
My little plum is what you <mark3>said.</mark3><br>
At night, alone, I marry the <mark1>bed.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then my black-eyed rival <mark3>came.</mark3><br>
The lady of water, rising on the <mark3>beach,</mark3><br>
a piano at her fingertips, <mark3>shame</mark3><br>
on her lips and a flute's <mark3>speech.</mark3><br>
And I was the knock-kneed broom <mark3>instead.</mark3><br>
At night, alone, I marry the <mark1>bed.</mark1><br>
<br>
She took you the way a woman <mark3>takes</mark3><br>
a bargain dress off the <mark3>rack</mark3><br>
and I broke the way a stone <mark3>breaks.</mark3><br>
I give back your books and fishing <mark3>tack.</mark3><br>
Today's paper says that you are <mark3>wed.</mark3><br>
At night, alone, I marry the <mark1>bed.</mark1><br>
<br>
The boys and girls are one <mark3>tonight.</mark3><br>
They unbutton <mark4>blouses</mark4>, They unzip <mark4>flies.</mark4><br>
They take off shoes. They turn off the <mark3>light.</mark3><br>
The glimmering creatures are full of <mark3>lies.</mark3><br>
They are eating each other. They are <mark3>overfed.</mark3><br>
At night, alone, I marry the <mark1>bed.</mark1><br>
