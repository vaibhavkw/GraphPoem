Title : America <br>
Author : Tony Hoagland <br><br>

Then one of the students with blue hair and a tongue <mark4>stud</mark4><br>
Says that America is for him a maximum-security <mark4>prison</mark4><br>
<br>
Whose walls are made of RadioShacks and Burger <mark4>Kings</mark4>, and MTV <mark4>episodes</mark4><br>
Where you can't tell the show from the <mark4>commercials,</mark4><br>
<br>
And as I consider how to express how full of shit I think he <mark4>is,</mark4><br>
He says that even when he's driving to the mall in his Isuzu <br>
<br>
Trooper with a gang of his friends, letting rap music pour over them   <br>
Like a boiling Jacuzzi full of ballpeen <mark4>hammers</mark4>, even then he <mark4>feels</mark4><br>
<br>
Buried alive, captured and suffocated in the <mark4>folds</mark4><br>
Of the thick satin quilt of America <br>
<br>
And I wonder if this is a legitimate category of <mark4>pain,</mark4><br>
or whether he is just spin doctoring a better <mark4>grade,</mark4><br>
<br>
And then I remember that when I stabbed my father in the dream last <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
It was not blood but <mark4>money</mark4><br>
<br>
That gushed out of him, bright green hundred-dollar <mark4>bills</mark4><br>
Spilling from his wounds, and--this is the weird <mark4>part--,</mark4><br>
<br>
He gasped "Thank god--those Ben Franklins were   <br>
Clogging up my <mark3>heart--</mark3><br>
<br>
And so I perish <mark4>happily,</mark4><br>
Freed from that which kept me from my liberty"-- <br>
<br>
Which was when I knew it was a dream, since my <mark4>dad</mark4><br>
Would never speak in rhymed couplets, <br>
<br>
And I look at the student with his acne and cell phone and phony ghetto <mark4>clothes</mark4><br>
And I think, "I am asleep in America <mark3>too,</mark3><br>
<br>
And I don't know how to wake myself <mark4>either,"</mark4><br>
And I remember what Marx said near the end of his life: <br>
<br>
"I was listening to the cries of the <mark4>past,</mark4><br>
When I should have been listening to the cries of the <mark4>future."</mark4><br>
<br>
But how could he have imagined 100 channels of 24-hour cable <br>
Or what kind of nightmare it might <mark4>be</mark4><br>
<br>
When each day you watch rivers of bright merchandise run past <mark3>you</mark3><br>
And you are floating in your pleasure boat upon this <mark4>river</mark4><br>
<br>
Even while others are drowning underneath <mark1>you</mark1><br>
And you see their faces twisting in the surface of the <mark4>waters</mark4><br>
<br>
And yet it seems to be your own <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
Which turns the volume <mark4>higher?</mark4><br>
