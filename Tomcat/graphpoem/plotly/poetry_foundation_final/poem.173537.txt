Title : The Star-splitter <br>
Author : Robert Frost <br><br>

"You know Orion always comes up <mark4>sideways.</mark4><br>
Throwing a leg up over our fence of <mark4>mountains,</mark4><br>
And rising on his hands, he looks in on <mark1>me</mark1><br>
Busy outdoors by lantern-light with <mark4>something</mark4><br>
I should have done by daylight, and <mark4>indeed,</mark4><br>
After the ground is <mark4>frozen</mark4>, I should have <mark4>done</mark4><br>
Before it froze, and a gust flings a <mark4>handful</mark4><br>
Of waste leaves at my smoky lantern <mark4>chimney</mark4><br>
To make fun of my way of doing <mark4>things,</mark4><br>
Or else fun of Orion's having caught <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
Has a man, I should like to ask, no <mark4>rights</mark4><br>
These forces are obliged to pay respect <mark1>to?"</mark1><br>
So Brad McLaughlin mingled reckless <mark4>talk</mark4><br>
Of heavenly stars with hugger-mugger <mark4>farming,</mark4><br>
Till having failed at hugger-mugger <mark1>farming,</mark1><br>
He burned his house down for the fire <mark4>insurance</mark4><br>
And spent the proceeds on a <mark1>telescope</mark1><br>
To satisfy a lifelong <mark4>curiosity</mark4><br>
About our place among the infinities.<br>
<br>
"What do you want with one of those blame <mark1>things?"</mark1><br>
I asked him well beforehand. "Don't you get <mark3>one!"</mark3><br>
<br>
"Don't call it blamed; there isn't <mark4>anything</mark4><br>
More blameless in the sense of being <mark4>less</mark4><br>
A weapon in our human fight," he <mark4>said.</mark4><br>
"I'll have one if I sell my farm to buy <mark4>it."</mark4><br>
There where he moved the rocks to plow the <mark4>ground</mark4><br>
And plowed between the rocks he couldn't <mark4>move,</mark4><br>
Few farms changed <mark4>hands</mark4>, so rather than spend <mark4>years</mark4><br>
Trying to sell his farm and then not <mark4>selling,</mark4><br>
He burned his house down for the fire <mark1>insurance</mark1><br>
And bought the telescope with what it came <mark1>to.</mark1><br>
He had been heard to say by <mark4>several:</mark4><br>
"The best thing that we're put here for's to <mark3>see;</mark3><br>
The strongest thing that's given us to see <mark4>with's</mark4><br>
A telescope. Someone in every <mark4>town</mark4><br>
Seems to me owes it to the town to keep <mark1>one.</mark1><br>
In Littleton it may as well be <mark1>me."</mark1><br>
After such loose talk it was no <mark4>surprise</mark4><br>
When he did what he did and burned his house <mark4>down.</mark4><br>
<br>
Mean laughter went about the town that day<br>
To let him know we weren't the least imposed <mark4>on,</mark4><br>
And he could wait--we'd see to him tomorrow.<br>
But the first thing next morning we <mark4>reflected</mark4><br>
If one by one we counted people <mark4>out</mark4><br>
For the least sin, it wouldn't take us <mark4>long</mark4><br>
To get so we had no one left to live <mark5>with.</mark5><br>
For to be social is to be <mark4>forgiving.</mark4><br>
Our thief, the one who does our stealing from <mark4>us,</mark4><br>
We don't cut off from coming to church <mark4>suppers,</mark4><br>
But what we miss we go to him and ask <mark5>for.</mark5><br>
He promptly gives it back, that is if <mark4>still</mark4><br>
Uneaten, unworn out, or undisposed <mark4>of.</mark4><br>
It wouldn't do to be too hard on <mark4>Brad</mark4><br>
About his telescope. Beyond the age<br>
Of being given one for Christmas <mark4>gift,</mark4><br>
He had to take the best way he knew how<br>
To find himself in one. Well, all we said <mark4>was</mark4><br>
He took a strange thing to be roguish <mark4>over.</mark4><br>
Some sympathy was wasted on the <mark4>house,</mark4><br>
A good old-timer dating back <mark4>along;</mark4><br>
But a house isn't sentient; the <mark1>house</mark1><br>
Didn't feel anything. And if it <mark4>did,</mark4><br>
Why not regard it as a <mark4>sacrifice,</mark4><br>
And an old-fashioned sacrifice by <mark4>fire,</mark4><br>
Instead of a new-fashioned one at <mark4>auction?</mark4><br>
<br>
Out of a house and so out of a <mark5>farm</mark5><br>
At one stroke (of a match), Brad had to <mark4>turn</mark4><br>
To earn a living on the Concord <mark4>railroad,</mark4><br>
As under-ticket-agent at a <mark4>station</mark4><br>
Where his job, when he wasn't selling <mark4>tickets,</mark4><br>
Was setting out up track and down, not <mark4>plants</mark4><br>
As on a farm, but planets, evening <mark4>stars</mark4><br>
That varied in their hue from red to <mark4>green.</mark4><br>
<br>
He got a good glass for six hundred <mark4>dollars.</mark4><br>
His new job gave him leisure for <mark5>stargazing.</mark5><br>
Often he bid me come and have a <mark4>look</mark4><br>
Up the brass barrel, velvet black <mark4>inside,</mark4><br>
At a star quaking in the other <mark4>end.</mark4><br>
I recollect a night of broken <mark4>clouds</mark4><br>
And underfoot snow melted down to <mark4>ice,</mark4><br>
And melting further in the wind to <mark4>mud.</mark4><br>
Bradford and I had out the <mark1>telescope.</mark1><br>
We spread our two legs as it spread its <mark3>three,</mark3><br>
Pointed our thoughts the way we pointed <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
And standing at our leisure till the day <mark4>broke,</mark4><br>
Said some of the best things we ever <mark1>said.</mark1><br>
That telescope was christened the <mark4>Star-Splitter,</mark4><br>
Because it didn't do a thing but <mark3>split</mark3><br>
A star in two or three the way you <mark1>split</mark1><br>
A globule of quicksilver in your <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
With one stroke of your finger in the <mark4>middle.</mark4><br>
It's a star-splitter if there ever was <mark1>one,</mark1><br>
And ought to do some good if splitting <mark1>stars</mark1><br>
'Sa thing to be compared with splitting <mark4>wood.</mark4><br>
<br>
We've looked and looked, but after all where are <mark3>we?</mark3><br>
Do we know any better where we <mark3>are,</mark3><br>
And how it stands between the night <mark4>tonight</mark4><br>
And a man with a smoky lantern <mark1>chimney?</mark1><br>
How different from the way it ever <mark3>stood?</mark3><br>
