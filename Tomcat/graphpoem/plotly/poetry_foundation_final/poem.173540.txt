Title : The Tuft of Flowers <br>
Author : Robert Frost <br><br>

I went to turn the grass once after <mark3>one</mark3><br>
Who mowed it in the dew before the <mark3>sun.</mark3><br>
<br>
The dew was gone that made his blade so <mark4>keen</mark4><br>
Before I came to view the levelled <mark3>scene.</mark3><br>
<br>
I looked for him behind an isle of <mark3>trees;</mark3><br>
I listened for his whetstone on the <mark3>breeze.</mark3><br>
<br>
But he had gone his way, the grass all mown,<br>
And I must be, as he had been,?alone,<br>
<br>
As all must be,' I said within my <mark3>heart,</mark3><br>
Whether they work together or <mark3>apart.'</mark3><br>
<br>
But as I said it, swift there passed me <mark3>by</mark3><br>
On noiseless wing a 'wildered butterfly,<br>
<br>
Seeking with memories grown dim o'er <mark4>night</mark4><br>
Some resting flower of yesterday's <mark3>delight.</mark3><br>
<br>
And once I marked his flight go round and <mark3>round,</mark3><br>
As where some flower lay withering on the <mark3>ground.</mark3><br>
<br>
And then he flew as far as eye could <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
And then on tremulous wing came back to <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
<br>
I thought of questions that have no <mark3>reply,</mark3><br>
And would have turned to toss the grass to <mark3>dry;</mark3><br>
<br>
But he turned first, and led my eye to <mark3>look</mark3><br>
At a tall tuft of flowers beside a <mark3>brook,</mark3><br>
<br>
A leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had <mark4>spared</mark4><br>
Beside a reedy brook the scythe had <mark3>bared.</mark3><br>
<br>
I left my place to know them by their <mark3>name,</mark3><br>
Finding them butterfly weed when I <mark3>came.</mark3><br>
<br>
The mower in the dew had loved them <mark3>thus,</mark3><br>
By leaving them to flourish, not for <mark3>us,</mark3><br>
<br>
Nor yet to draw one thought of ours to <mark4>him.</mark4><br>
But from sheer morning gladness at the <mark3>brim.</mark3><br>
<br>
The butterfly and I had lit <mark4>upon,</mark4><br>
Nevertheless, a message from the <mark4>dawn,</mark4><br>
<br>
That made me hear the wakening birds <mark4>around,</mark4><br>
And hear his long scythe whispering to the <mark1>ground,</mark1><br>
<br>
And feel a spirit kindred to my <mark4>own;</mark4><br>
So that henceforth I worked no more <mark3>alone;</mark3><br>
<br>
But glad with him, I worked as with his <mark4>aid,</mark4><br>
And weary, sought at noon with him the <mark3>shade;</mark3><br>
<br>
And dreaming, as it were, held brotherly <mark3>speech</mark3><br>
With one whose thought I had not hoped to <mark3>reach.</mark3><br>
<br>
Men work together,' I told him from the <mark1>heart,</mark1><br>
Whether they work together or <mark1>apart.'</mark1><br>
