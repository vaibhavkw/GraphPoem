Title : The Lotos-eaters <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

"Courage!" he <mark4>said</mark4>, and pointed toward the <mark4>land,</mark4><br>
"This mounting wave will roll us shoreward <mark3>soon."</mark3><br>
In the afternoon they came unto a <mark1>land</mark1><br>
In which it seemed always <mark3>afternoon.</mark3><br>
All round the coast the languid air did <mark3>swoon,</mark3><br>
Breathing like one that hath a weary <mark3>dream.</mark3><br>
Full-faced above the valley stood the <mark3>moon;</mark3><br>
And like a downward smoke, the slender <mark3>stream</mark3><br>
Along the cliff to fall and pause and fall did <mark3>seem.</mark3><br>
<br>
A land of streams! some, like a downward <mark3>smoke,</mark3><br>
Slow-dropping veils of thinnest lawn, did <mark3>go;</mark3><br>
And some thro' wavering lights and shadows <mark3>broke,</mark3><br>
Rolling a slumbrous sheet of foam <mark3>below.</mark3><br>
They saw the gleaming river seaward <mark3>flow</mark3><br>
From the inner land: far off, three <mark4>mountain-tops,</mark4><br>
Three silent pinnacles of aged <mark3>snow,</mark3><br>
Stood sunset-flush'd: and, dew'd with showery <mark4>drops,</mark4><br>
Up-clomb the shadowy pine above the woven copse. <br>
<br>
The charmed sunset linger'd low adown <br>
In the red West: thro' mountain clefts the <mark3>dale</mark3><br>
Was seen far inland, and the yellow <mark4>down</mark4><br>
Border'd with palm, and many a winding <mark3>vale</mark3><br>
And meadow, set with slender galingale; <br>
A land where all things always seem'd the <mark4>same!</mark4><br>
And round about the keel with faces <mark3>pale,</mark3><br>
Dark faces pale against that rosy <mark3>flame,</mark3><br>
The mild-eyed melancholy Lotos-eaters <mark3>came.</mark3><br>
<br>
Branches they bore of that enchanted <mark4>stem,</mark4><br>
Laden with flower and fruit, whereof they <mark3>gave</mark3><br>
To each, but whoso did receive of <mark3>them,</mark3><br>
And taste, to him the gushing of the <mark3>wave</mark3><br>
Far far away did seem to mourn and <mark3>rave</mark3><br>
On alien shores; and if his fellow <mark4>spake,</mark4><br>
His voice was thin, as voices from the <mark3>grave;</mark3><br>
And deep-asleep he seem'd, yet all <mark3>awake,</mark3><br>
And music in his ears his beating heart did <mark3>make.</mark3><br>
<br>
They sat them down upon the yellow <mark3>sand,</mark3><br>
Between the sun and moon upon the <mark4>shore;</mark4><br>
And sweet it was to dream of <mark4>Fatherland,</mark4><br>
Of child, and wife, and slave; but <mark4>evermore</mark4><br>
Most weary seem'd the sea, weary the <mark4>oar,</mark4><br>
Weary the wandering fields of barren <mark4>foam.</mark4><br>
Then some one said, "We will return no <mark3>more";</mark3><br>
And all at once they sang, "Our island <mark3>home</mark3><br>
Is far beyond the wave; we will no longer <mark3>roam."</mark3><br>
<br>
CHORIC <mark4>SONG</mark4><br>
<br>
There is sweet music here that softer <mark3>falls</mark3><br>
Than petals from blown roses on the <mark4>grass,</mark4><br>
Or night-dews on still waters between <mark3>walls</mark3><br>
Of shadowy granite, in a gleaming <mark3>pass;</mark3><br>
Music that gentlier on the spirit <mark4>lies,</mark4><br>
Than tir'd eyelids upon tir'd <mark3>eyes;</mark3><br>
Music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful <mark3>skies.</mark3><br>
Here are cool mosses <mark3>deep,</mark3><br>
And thro' the moss the ivies <mark3>creep,</mark3><br>
And in the stream the long-leaved flowers <mark3>weep,</mark3><br>
And from the craggy ledge the poppy hangs in <mark3>sleep."</mark3><br>
<br>
Why are we weigh'd upon with heaviness, <br>
And utterly consumed with sharp <mark4>distress,</mark4><br>
While all things else have rest from <mark4>weariness?</mark4><br>
All things have rest: why should we toil <mark4>alone,</mark4><br>
We only toil, who are the first of <mark4>things,</mark4><br>
And make perpetual <mark3>moan,</mark3><br>
Still from one sorrow to another <mark3>thrown:</mark3><br>
Nor ever fold our <mark3>wings,</mark3><br>
And cease from <mark4>wanderings,</mark4><br>
Nor steep our brows in slumber's holy <mark4>balm;</mark4><br>
Nor harken what the inner spirit <mark4>sings,</mark4><br>
"There is no joy but <mark3>calm!"</mark3><br>
Why should we only toil, the roof and crown of <mark1>things?</mark1><br>
Lo! in the middle of the <mark4>wood,</mark4><br>
<br>
The folded leaf is woo'd from out the <mark4>bud</mark4><br>
With winds upon the branch, and <mark4>there</mark4><br>
Grows green and broad, and takes no <mark3>care,</mark3><br>
Sun-steep'd at <mark3>noon</mark3>, and in the <mark1>moon</mark1><br>
Nightly dew-fed; and turning <mark3>yellow</mark3><br>
Falls, and floats adown the <mark3>air.</mark3><br>
Lo! sweeten'd with the summer <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
The full-juiced apple, waxing <mark3>over-mellow,</mark3><br>
Drops in a silent autumn <mark3>night.</mark3><br>
All its allotted length of <mark4>days</mark4><br>
The flower ripens in its <mark4>place,</mark4><br>
Ripens and fades, and falls, and hath no <mark4>toil,</mark4><br>
Fast-rooted in the fruitful <mark3>soil.</mark3><br>
Hateful is the dark-blue <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
Vaulted o'er the dark-blue <mark3>sea.</mark3><br>
<br>
Death is the end of life; ah, <mark3>why</mark3><br>
Should life all labour <mark3>be?</mark3><br>
Let us alone. Time driveth onward <mark4>fast,</mark4><br>
And in a little while our lips are <mark4>dumb.</mark4><br>
Let us alone. What is it that will <mark3>last?</mark3><br>
All things are taken from us, and <mark3>become</mark3><br>
Portions and parcels of the dreadful <mark3>past.</mark3><br>
Let us alone. What pleasure can we <mark4>have</mark4><br>
To war with evil? Is there any <mark4>peace</mark4><br>
In ever climbing up the climbing <mark1>wave?</mark1><br>
All things have rest, and ripen toward the <mark1>grave</mark1><br>
In silence; ripen, fall and <mark3>cease:</mark3><br>
Give us long rest or death, dark death, or dreamful <mark4>ease.</mark4><br>
How sweet it were, hearing the downward <mark1>stream,</mark1><br>
With half-shut eyes ever to <mark1>seem</mark1><br>
Falling asleep in a <mark3>half-dream!</mark3><br>
<br>
To dream and dream, like yonder amber <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
Which will not leave the myrrh-bush on the <mark3>height;</mark3><br>
To hear each other's whisper'd <mark3>speech;</mark3><br>
Eating the Lotos day by <mark5>day,</mark5><br>
To watch the crisping ripples on the <mark3>beach,</mark3><br>
And tender curving lines of creamy <mark3>spray;</mark3><br>
To lend our hearts and spirits <mark4>wholly</mark4><br>
To the influence of mild-minded <mark4>melancholy;</mark4><br>
To muse and brood and live again in <mark4>memory,</mark4><br>
With those old faces of our <mark4>infancy</mark4><br>
Heap'd over with a mound of <mark1>grass,</mark1><br>
Two handfuls of white dust, shut in an urn of <mark3>brass!</mark3><br>
Dear is the memory of our wedded <mark4>lives,</mark4><br>
And dear the last embraces of our <mark3>wives</mark3><br>
And their warm tears: but all hath suffer'd <mark3>change:</mark3><br>
For surely now our household hearths are <mark4>cold,</mark4><br>
<br>
Our sons inherit us: our looks are <mark3>strange:</mark3><br>
And we should come like ghosts to trouble <mark3>joy.</mark3><br>
Or else the island princes <mark3>over-bold</mark3><br>
Have eat our substance, and the minstrel <mark1>sings</mark1><br>
Before them of the ten years' war in <mark3>Troy,</mark3><br>
And our great <mark4>deeds</mark4>, as half-forgotten <mark1>things.</mark1><br>
Is there confusion in the little <mark4>isle?</mark4><br>
Let what is broken so <mark4>remain.</mark4><br>
The Gods are hard to <mark4>reconcile:</mark4><br>
'Tis hard to settle order once <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
There is confusion worse than <mark3>death,</mark3><br>
Trouble on trouble, pain on <mark3>pain,</mark3><br>
Long labour unto aged <mark3>breath,</mark3><br>
Sore task to hearts worn out by many <mark4>wars</mark4><br>
And eyes grown dim with gazing on the <mark4>pilot-stars.</mark4><br>
But, propt on beds of amaranth and <mark4>moly,</mark4><br>
How sweet (while warm airs lull us, blowing <mark3>lowly)</mark3><br>
With half-dropt eyelid <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
Beneath a heaven dark and <mark3>holy,</mark3><br>
To watch the long bright river drawing <mark3>slowly</mark3><br>
<br>
His waters from the purple <mark3>hill--</mark3><br>
To hear the dewy echoes <mark4>calling</mark4><br>
From cave to cave thro' the thick-twined <mark4>vine--</mark4><br>
To watch the emerald-colour'd water <mark4>falling</mark4><br>
Thro' many a wov'n acanthus-wreath <mark3>divine!</mark3><br>
Only to hear and see the far-off sparkling <mark3>brine,</mark3><br>
Only to hear were sweet, stretch'd out beneath the <mark3>pine.</mark3><br>
The Lotos blooms below the barren <mark4>peak:</mark4><br>
The Lotos blows by every winding <mark3>creek:</mark3><br>
All day the wind breathes low with mellower <mark4>tone:</mark4><br>
Thro' every hollow cave and alley <mark3>lone</mark3><br>
Round and round the spicy downs the yellow Lotos-dust is <mark3>blown.</mark3><br>
We have had enough of action, and of motion <mark3>we,</mark3><br>
<br>
Roll'd to starboard, roll'd to larboard, when the surge was seething <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
Where the wallowing monster spouted his foam-fountains in the <mark1>sea.</mark1><br>
Let us swear an oath, and keep it with an equal <mark4>mind,</mark4><br>
In the hollow Lotos-land to live and lie <mark3>reclined</mark3><br>
On the hills like Gods together, careless of <mark3>mankind.</mark3><br>
For they lie beside their nectar, and the bolts are <mark4>hurl'd</mark4><br>
Far below them in the <mark4>valleys</mark4>, and the clouds are lightly <mark3>curl'd</mark3><br>
Round their golden houses, girdled with the gleaming <mark4>world:</mark4><br>
Where they smile in secret, looking over wasted <mark4>lands,</mark4><br>
Blight and famine, plague and earthquake, roaring deeps and fiery <mark3>sands,</mark3><br>
Clanging fights, and flaming towns, and sinking ships, and praying <mark3>hands.</mark3><br>
But they smile, they find a music centred in a doleful <mark1>song</mark1><br>
Steaming up, a lamentation and an ancient tale of <mark3>wrong,</mark3><br>
Like a tale of little meaning tho' the words are <mark3>strong;</mark3><br>
Chanted from an ill-used race of men that cleave the <mark1>soil,</mark1><br>
Sow the seed, and reap the harvest with enduring <mark1>toil,</mark1><br>
Storing yearly little dues of wheat, and wine and <mark3>oil;</mark3><br>
Till they perish and they suffer--some, 'tis whisper'd--down in <mark4>hell</mark4><br>
Suffer endless anguish, others in Elysian valleys <mark3>dwell,</mark3><br>
Resting weary limbs at last on beds of asphodel. <br>
Surely, surely, slumber is more sweet than toil, the <mark1>shore</mark1><br>
Than labour in the deep mid-ocean, wind and wave and <mark1>oar;</mark1><br>
O, rest ye, brother mariners, we will not wander <mark1>more.</mark1><br>
