Title : Tho' Lack of Laurels and of Wreaths Not One <br>
Author : Trumbull Stickney <br><br>

Tho' lack of laurels and of wreaths not <mark2>one</mark2><br>
Prove you our lives abortive, shall we <mark3>yet</mark3><br>
Vaunt us our single aim, our hearts full <mark3>set</mark3><br>
To win the guerdon which is never <mark2>won.</mark2><br>
Witness, a purpose never is <mark3>undone.</mark3><br>
And tho' fate drain our seas of <mark4>violet</mark4><br>
To gather round our lives her wide-hung <mark4>net,</mark4><br>
Memories of hopes that are not shall <mark4>atone.</mark4><br>
Not wholly starless is the ill-starred <mark3>life,</mark3><br>
Not all is night in failure, and the <mark4>shield</mark4><br>
Sometimes well grasped, tho' shattered in the <mark3>strife.</mark3><br>
And here while all the lowering heaven is <mark4>ringed</mark4><br>
With our loud death-shouts <mark4>echoed</mark4>, on the <mark4>field</mark4><br>
Stands forth our Nike, <mark4>proud</mark4>, tho' <mark4>broken-winged.</mark4><br>
