Title : Cities <br>
Author : H. D. <br><br>

Can we believe--by an <mark4>effort</mark4><br>
comfort our <mark4>hearts:</mark4><br>
it is not waste all <mark4>this,</mark4><br>
not placed here in <mark4>disgust,</mark4><br>
street after <mark4>street,</mark4><br>
each patterned <mark4>alike,</mark4><br>
no grace to <mark5>lighten</mark5><br>
a single house of the <mark4>hundred</mark4><br>
crowded into one <mark4>garden-space.</mark4><br>
<br>
Crowded--can we <mark4>believe,</mark4><br>
not in utter <mark1>disgust,</mark1><br>
in ironical <mark5>play--</mark5><br>
but the maker of cities grew <mark4>faint</mark4><br>
with the beauty of <mark1>temple</mark1><br>
and space before <mark1>temple,</mark1><br>
arch upon perfect arch, <br>
of pillars and corridors that led <mark4>out</mark4><br>
to strange court-yards and <mark4>porches</mark4><br>
where sun-light <mark4>stamped</mark4><br>
<br>
black on the <mark4>pavement.</mark4><br>
<br>
That the maker of cities grew <mark1>faint</mark1><br>
with the splendour of <mark4>palaces,</mark4><br>
paused while the <mark4>incense-flowers</mark4><br>
from the <mark4>incense-trees</mark4><br>
dropped on the <mark4>marble-walk,</mark4><br>
thought anew, fashioned <mark1>this--</mark1><br>
street after street <mark1>alike.</mark1><br>
<br>
For <mark4>alas,</mark4><br>
he had crowded the city so <mark4>full</mark4><br>
that men could not grasp <mark4>beauty,</mark4><br>
beauty was over <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
through <mark1>them</mark1>, about <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
no crevice unpacked with the <mark4>honey,</mark4><br>
rare, measureless. <br>
<br>
So he built a new <mark4>city,</mark4><br>
ah can we believe, not <mark4>ironically</mark4><br>
but for new <mark1>splendour</mark1><br>
constructed new <mark4>people</mark4><br>
to lift through slow <mark4>growth</mark4><br>
to a beauty unrivalled <mark4>yet--</mark4><br>
and created new <mark4>cells,</mark4><br>
hideous first, hideous now-- <br>
spread larve across <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
not honey but seething <mark1>life.</mark1><br>
<br>
And in these dark <mark1>cells,</mark1><br>
packed street after <mark1>street,</mark1><br>
souls live, hideous <mark1>yet--</mark1><br>
O disfigured, <mark4>defaced,</mark4><br>
with no trace of the <mark1>beauty</mark1><br>
men once held so <mark4>light.</mark4><br>
<br>
Can we think a few old <mark1>cells</mark1><br>
were left--we are <mark4>left--</mark4><br>
grains of <mark1>honey,</mark1><br>
old dust of stray <mark4>pollen</mark4><br>
dull on our torn <mark4>wings,</mark4><br>
we are left to recall the old <mark4>streets?</mark4><br>
<br>
Is our task the less <mark4>sweet</mark4><br>
that the larvae still sleep in their <mark1>cells?</mark1><br>
Or crawl out to attack our frail <mark4>strength:</mark4><br>
You are useless. We <mark4>live.</mark4><br>
We await great <mark4>events.</mark4><br>
We are spread through this <mark4>earth.</mark4><br>
We protect our strong <mark4>race.</mark4><br>
You are <mark4>useless.</mark4><br>
Your cell takes the <mark4>place</mark4><br>
of our young future <mark1>strength.</mark1><br>
<br>
Though they sleep or wake to <mark4>torment</mark4><br>
and wish to displace our old <mark1>cells--</mark1><br>
thin rare <mark4>gold--</mark4><br>
that their larve grow <mark4>fat--</mark4><br>
is our task the less <mark1>sweet?</mark1><br>
<br>
Though we wander <mark4>about,</mark4><br>
find no honey of flowers in this <mark4>waste,</mark4><br>
is our task the less <mark1>sweet--</mark1><br>
who recall the old <mark1>splendour,</mark1><br>
await the new beauty of <mark4>cities?</mark4><br>
<br>
The city is <mark4>peopled</mark4><br>
with spirits, not ghosts, O my <mark4>love:</mark4><br>
<br>
Though they crowded <mark4>between</mark4><br>
and usurped the kiss of my <mark4>mouth</mark4><br>
their breath was your <mark4>gift,</mark4><br>
their beauty, your <mark1>life.</mark1><br>
