Title : The Penitent <br>
Author : Edna St. Vincent Millay <br><br>

I had a little Sorrow,<br>
Born of a little <mark3>Sin,</mark3><br>
I found a room all damp with <mark3>gloom</mark3><br>
And shut us all <mark3>within;</mark3><br>
And, "Little Sorrow, weep," said <mark3>I,</mark3><br>
"And, Little Sin, pray God to <mark3>die,</mark3><br>
And I upon the floor will <mark3>lie</mark3><br>
And think how bad I've <mark3>been!"</mark3><br>
<br>
Alas for pious planning ?<br>
It mattered not a <mark3>whit!</mark3><br>
As far as gloom went in that <mark3>room,</mark3><br>
The lamp might have been <mark3>lit!</mark3><br>
My Little Sorrow would not <mark3>weep,</mark3><br>
My Little Sin would go to sleep <mark3>?</mark3><br>
To save my soul I could not <mark3>keep</mark3><br>
My graceless mind on <mark3>it!</mark3><br>
<br>
So up I got in anger,<br>
And took a book I <mark3>had,</mark3><br>
And put a ribbon on my hair<br>
To please a passing <mark3>lad.</mark3><br>
And, "One thing there's no getting by <mark3>?</mark3><br>
I've been a wicked girl," said <mark1>I;</mark1><br>
"But if I can't be sorry, <mark3>why,</mark3><br>
I might as well be <mark3>glad!"</mark3><br>
