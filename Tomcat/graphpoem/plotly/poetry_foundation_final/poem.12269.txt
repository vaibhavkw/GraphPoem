Title : Conscription Camp<br>
Author : Karl Shapiro<br><br>

Your landscape sickens with a dry <mark4>disease</mark4><br>
Even in May, Virginia, and your sweet <mark4>pines</mark4><br>
Like Frenchmen runted in a hundred <mark4>wars</mark4><br>
Are of a child's height in these <mark4>battlefields.</mark4><br>
<br>
For Wilson sowed his teeth where generals <mark4>prayed</mark4><br>
?High-sounding Lafayette and sick-eyed Lee?<br>
The loud Elizabethan crashed your <mark4>swamps</mark4><br>
Like elephants and the subtle Indian <mark4>fell.</mark4><br>
<br>
Is it for love, you ancient-minded <mark4>towns,</mark4><br>
That on the tidy grass of your great <mark4>graves</mark4><br>
And on your roads and riverways <mark4>serene</mark4><br>
Between the corn with green flags in a <mark3>row,</mark3><br>
<br>
Wheat amorous as hair and hills like <mark4>breasts</mark4><br>
Each generation, ignorant of the <mark4>last,</mark4><br>
Mumbling in sheds, embarrassed to <mark4>salute,</mark4><br>
Comes back to choke on etiquette of <mark4>hate?</mark4><br>
<br>
You manufacture history like <mark4>jute?</mark4><br>
Labor is cheap, Virginia, for high <mark4>deeds,</mark4><br>
But in your British dream of <mark4>reputation</mark4><br>
The black man is your conscience and your <mark4>cost.</mark4><br>
<br>
Here on the plains perfect for civil <mark5>war</mark5><br>
The clapboard city like a weak mirage <br>
Of order rises from the sand to <mark4>house</mark4><br>
These thousands and the paranoid <mark3>Monroe;</mark3><br>
<br>
The sunrise gun rasps in the throat of <mark4>heaven;</mark4><br>
The lungs of dawn are heavy and <mark4>corrupt;</mark4><br>
We hawk and spit; our flag walks through the <mark4>air</mark4><br>
Breathing hysteria thickly in each <mark4>face.</mark4><br>
<br>
Through the long school of day, absent in <mark4>heart,</mark4><br>
Distant in every thought but self we <mark4>tread,</mark4><br>
Wheeling in blocks like large expensive <mark4>toys</mark4><br>
That never understand except through <mark4>fun.</mark4><br>
<br>
To steal aside as aimlessly as curs<br>
Is our desire; to stare at <mark5>corporals</mark5><br>
As sceptically as boys; not to <mark4>believe</mark4><br>
The misty-eyed letter and the cheap <mark4>snapshot.</mark4><br>
<br>
To cross the unnatural frontier of your <mark4>name</mark4><br>
Is our free dream, Virginia, and <mark4>beyond,</mark4><br>
White and unpatriotic in our <mark4>beds,</mark4><br>
To rise from sleep like driftwood out of surf.<br>
<br>
But stricter than parole is this same <mark4>wall</mark4><br>
And these green <mark4>clothes</mark4>, a secret on the <mark4>fields,</mark4><br>
In towns betray us to the arresting touch <br>
Of <mark4>lady-wardens</mark4>, good and evil <mark4>wives.</mark4><br>
<br>
And far and fabulous is the word <mark4>"Outside"</mark4><br>
Like "Europe" when the midnight liners <mark4>sailed,</mark4><br>
Leaving a wake of ermine on the <mark4>tide</mark4><br>
Where rubies drowned and eyes were softly drunk.<br>
<br>
Still we abhor your news and every <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
Except the Personal <mark4>Enemy's</mark4>, and <mark4>songs</mark4><br>
That pumped by the great central heart of <mark4>love</mark4><br>
On tides of energy at evening <mark4>come.</mark4><br>
<br>
Instinctively to break your compact law <br>
Box within box, Virginia, and throw <mark4>down</mark4><br>
The dangerous bright habits of pure <mark4>form</mark4><br>
We struggle hideously and cry for <mark4>fear.</mark4><br>
<br>
And like a very tired whore who <mark4>stands</mark4><br>
Wrapped in the sensual crimson of her <mark4>art</mark4><br>
High in the tired doorway of a <mark4>street</mark4><br>
And beckons half-concealed the passerby,<br>
<br>
The sun, Virginia, on your Western <mark4>stairs</mark4><br>
Pauses and smiles away between the <mark4>trees,</mark4><br>
Motioning the soldier overhill to <mark3>town</mark3><br>
To his determined hungry burst of joy.<br>
