Title : Paradise Lost: Book 1 (1674 version) <br>
Author : John Milton <br><br>

OF Mans First Disobedience, and the <mark4>Fruit</mark4><br>
Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal <mark5>tast</mark5><br>
Brought Death into the World, and all our <mark1>woe,</mark1><br>
With loss of <mark4>Eden</mark4>, till one greater <mark4>Man</mark4><br>
Restore us, and regain the blissful <mark4>Seat,</mark4><br>
Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret <mark4>top</mark4><br>
Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst <mark4>inspire</mark4><br>
That <mark4>Shepherd</mark4>, who first taught the chosen <mark4>Seed,</mark4><br>
In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and <mark4>Earth</mark4><br>
Rose out of Chaos: or if Sion <mark3>Hill</mark3><br>
Delight thee more, and Siloa's brook that <mark4>flow'd</mark4><br>
Fast by the Oracle of God; I <mark4>thence</mark4><br>
Invoke thy aid to my adventrous <mark4>Song,</mark4><br>
That with no middle flight intends to <mark4>soar</mark4><br>
Above th' Aonian Mount, while it <mark4>pursues</mark4><br>
Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime. <br>
And chiefly Thou, O Spirit, that dost <mark5>prefer</mark5><br>
Before all Temples th' upright heart and <mark4>pure,</mark4><br>
Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the <mark4>first</mark4><br>
Wast present, and with mighty wings <mark5>outspread</mark5><br>
Dove-like satst brooding on the vast <mark4>Abyss</mark4><br>
And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is <mark4>dark</mark4><br>
Illumin, what is low raise and <mark4>support;</mark4><br>
That to the highth of this great <mark4>Argument</mark4><br>
I may assert Eternal <mark4>Providence,</mark4><br>
And justifie the wayes of God to <mark4>men.</mark4><br>
<br>
Say first, for Heav'n hides nothing from thy <mark3>view</mark3><br>
Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what <mark4>cause</mark4><br>
Mov'd our Grand Parents in that happy <mark4>State,</mark4><br>
Favour'd of Heav'n so highly, to fall <mark5>off</mark5><br>
From thir Creator, and transgress his <mark3>Will</mark3><br>
For one restraint, Lords of the World <mark4>besides?</mark4><br>
Who first seduc'd them to that foul <mark4>revolt?</mark4><br>
Th' infernal Serpent; he it was, whose <mark4>guile</mark4><br>
Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv'd <br>
The Mother of <mark4>Mankind</mark4>, what time his <mark4>Pride</mark4><br>
Had cast him out from Heav'n, with all his <mark4>Host</mark4><br>
Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid <mark4>aspiring</mark4><br>
To set himself in Glory above his <mark4>Peers,</mark4><br>
He trusted to have equal'd the most <mark3>High,</mark3><br>
If he oppos'd; and with ambitious <mark4>aim</mark4><br>
Against the Throne and Monarchy of <mark4>God</mark4><br>
Rais'd impious War in Heav'n and Battel <mark4>proud</mark4><br>
With vain attempt.   Him the Almighty <mark4>Power</mark4><br>
Hurld headlong flaming from th' Ethereal <mark5>Skie</mark5><br>
With hideous ruine and combustion <mark4>down</mark4><br>
To bottomless perdition, there to <mark4>dwell</mark4><br>
In Adamantine Chains and penal <mark4>Fire,</mark4><br>
Who durst defie th' Omnipotent to <mark4>Arms.</mark4><br>
Nine times the Space that measures Day and <mark4>Night</mark4><br>
To mortal men, he with his horrid <mark3>crew</mark3><br>
Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery <mark1>Gulfe</mark1><br>
Confounded though immortal: But his <mark4>doom</mark4><br>
Reserv'd him to more wrath; for now the <mark4>thought</mark4><br>
Both of lost happiness and lasting <mark4>pain</mark4><br>
Torments him; round he throws his baleful <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
That witness'd huge affliction and <mark5>dismay</mark5><br>
Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast <mark4>hate:</mark4><br>
At once as far as Angels kenn he <mark4>views</mark4><br>
The dismal Situation waste and <mark4>wilde,</mark4><br>
A Dungeon horrible, on all sides <mark4>round</mark4><br>
As one great Furnace <mark4>flam'd</mark4>, yet from those <mark4>flames</mark4><br>
No light, but rather darkness <mark4>visible</mark4><br>
Serv'd onely to discover sights of <mark1>woe,</mark1><br>
Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where <mark4>peace</mark4><br>
And rest can never dwell, hope never <mark4>comes</mark4><br>
That comes to all; but torture without <mark4>end</mark4><br>
Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, <mark4>fed</mark4><br>
With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum'd: <br>
Such place Eternal Justice had <mark5>prepar'd</mark5><br>
For those rebellious, here thir prison <mark4>ordained</mark4><br>
In utter darkness, and thir portion <mark4>set</mark4><br>
As far remov'd from God and light of <mark1>Heav'n</mark1><br>
As from the Center thrice to th' utmost <mark4>Pole.</mark4><br>
O how unlike the place from whence they <mark4>fell!</mark4><br>
There the companions of his fall, <mark4>o'rewhelm'd</mark4><br>
With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous <mark1>fire,</mark1><br>
He soon discerns, and weltring by his <mark4>side</mark4><br>
One next himself in power, and next in <mark4>crime,</mark4><br>
Long after known in Palestine, and <mark4>nam'd</mark4><br>
Beelzebub.   To whom th' <mark4>Arch-Enemy,</mark4><br>
And thence in Heav'n call'd Satan, with bold <mark4>words</mark4><br>
Breaking the horrid silence thus <mark4>began.</mark4><br>
<br>
If thou beest he; But O how fall'n! how <mark4>chang'd</mark4><br>
From him, who in the happy Realms of <mark4>Light</mark4><br>
Cloth'd with transcendent brightness didst <mark4>out-shine</mark4><br>
Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual <mark5>league,</mark5><br>
United thoughts and counsels, equal <mark4>hope</mark4><br>
And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize, <br>
Joynd with me once, now misery hath <mark5>joynd</mark5><br>
In equal ruin: into what Pit thou <mark5>seest</mark5><br>
From what highth fall'n, so much the stronger <mark5>prov'd</mark5><br>
He with his Thunder: and till then who <mark3>knew</mark3><br>
The force of those dire Arms?   yet not for <mark4>those,</mark4><br>
Nor what the Potent Victor in his <mark4>rage</mark4><br>
Can else inflict, do I repent or <mark4>change,</mark4><br>
Though chang'd in outward lustre; that fixt <mark4>mind</mark4><br>
And high disdain, from sence of injur'd <mark4>merit,</mark4><br>
That with the mightiest rais'd me to <mark4>contend,</mark4><br>
And to the fierce contention brought <mark4>along</mark4><br>
Innumerable force of Spirits <mark4>arm'd</mark4><br>
That durst dislike his reign, and me <mark4>preferring,</mark4><br>
His utmost power with adverse power oppos'd <br>
In dubious Battel on the Plains of <mark1>Heav'n,</mark1><br>
And shook his throne.   What though the field be <mark4>lost?</mark4><br>
All is not lost; the unconquerable <mark1>Will,</mark1><br>
And study of revenge, immortal <mark1>hate,</mark1><br>
And courage never to submit or <mark4>yield:</mark4><br>
And what is else not to be <mark4>overcome?</mark4><br>
That Glory never shall his wrath or <mark4>might</mark4><br>
Extort from me.   To bow and sue for <mark4>grace</mark4><br>
With suppliant knee, and deifie his <mark1>power,</mark1><br>
Who from the terrour of this Arm so <mark4>late</mark4><br>
Doubted his Empire, that were low <mark4>indeed,</mark4><br>
That were an ignominy and shame <mark4>beneath</mark4><br>
This downfall; since by Fate the strength of <mark4>Gods</mark4><br>
And this Empyreal substance cannot <mark4>fail,</mark4><br>
Since through experience of this great <mark4>event</mark4><br>
In Arms not worse, in foresight much <mark1>advanc't,</mark1><br>
We may with more successful hope <mark5>resolve</mark5><br>
To wage by force or guile eternal <mark4>Warr</mark4><br>
Irreconcileable, to our grand <mark3>Foe,</mark3><br>
Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of <mark5>joy</mark5><br>
Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of <mark1>Heav'n.</mark1><br>
<br>
So spake th' Apostate Angel, though in <mark1>pain,</mark1><br>
Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep <mark1>despare:</mark1><br>
And him thus answer'd soon his bold Compeer. <br>
<br>
O Prince, O Chief of many Throned <mark4>Powers,</mark4><br>
That led th' imbattelld Seraphim to <mark1>Warr</mark1><br>
Under thy conduct, and in dreadful <mark4>deeds</mark4><br>
Fearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual <mark4>King;</mark4><br>
And put to proof his sigh <mark4>Supremacy,</mark4><br>
Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or <mark4>Fate,</mark4><br>
Too well I see and rue the dire <mark1>event,</mark1><br>
That with sad overthrow and foul <mark4>defeat</mark4><br>
Hath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty <mark1>Host</mark1><br>
In horrible destruction laid thus <mark3>low,</mark3><br>
As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences <br>
Can perish: for the mind and spirit <mark4>remains</mark4><br>
Invincible, and vigour soon <mark4>returns,</mark4><br>
Though all our Glory extinct and happy <mark1>state</mark1><br>
Here swallow'd up in endless <mark4>misery.</mark4><br>
But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I <mark1>now</mark1><br>
Of force believe Almighty, since no <mark4>less</mark4><br>
Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as <mark4>ours)</mark4><br>
Have left us this our spirit and strength <mark5>intire</mark5><br>
Strongly to suffer and support our <mark4>pains,</mark4><br>
That we may so suffice his vengeful <mark4>ire,</mark4><br>
Or do him mightier service as his <mark5>thralls</mark5><br>
By right of Warr, what e're his business <mark4>be</mark4><br>
Here in the heart of Hell to work in <mark1>Fire,</mark1><br>
Or do his Errands in the gloomy <mark4>Deep;</mark4><br>
What can it then avail though yet we <mark4>feel</mark4><br>
Strength undiminisht, or eternal <mark4>being</mark4><br>
To undergo eternal <mark4>punishment?</mark4><br>
Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend <mark4>reply'd.</mark4><br>
<br>
Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is <mark4>miserable</mark4><br>
Doing or Suffering: but of this be <mark4>sure,</mark4><br>
To do ought good never will be our <mark4>task,</mark4><br>
But ever to do ill our sole <mark4>delight,</mark4><br>
As being the contrary to his high <mark1>will</mark1><br>
Whom we resist.   If then his <mark1>Providence</mark1><br>
Out of our evil seek to bring forth <mark4>good,</mark4><br>
Our labour must be to pervert that <mark1>end,</mark1><br>
And out of good still to find means of <mark4>evil;</mark4><br>
Which oft times may succeed, so as <mark4>perhaps</mark4><br>
Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and <mark5>disturb</mark5><br>
His inmost counsels from thir destind <mark1>aim.</mark1><br>
But see the angry Victor hath <mark4>recall'd</mark4><br>
His Ministers of vengeance and <mark4>pursuit</mark4><br>
Back to the Gates of Heav'n: the Sulphurous <mark4>Hail</mark4><br>
Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath <mark4>laid</mark4><br>
The fiery Surge, that from the <mark4>Precipice</mark4><br>
Of Heav'n receiv'd us falling, and the <mark4>Thunder,</mark4><br>
Wing'd with red Lightning and impetuous <mark1>rage,</mark1><br>
Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases <mark1>now</mark1><br>
To bellow through the vast and boundless <mark1>Deep.</mark1><br>
Let us not slip th' <mark4>occasion</mark4>, whether <mark4>scorn,</mark4><br>
Or satiate fury yield it from our <mark1>Foe.</mark1><br>
Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and <mark1>wilde,</mark1><br>
The seat of desolation, voyd of <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
Save what the glimmering of these livid <mark1>flames</mark1><br>
Casts pale and dreadful?   Thither let us <mark4>tend</mark4><br>
From off the tossing of these fiery <mark4>waves,</mark4><br>
There rest, if any rest can harbour <mark4>there,</mark4><br>
And reassembling our afflicted <mark1>Powers,</mark1><br>
Consult how we may henceforth most <mark3>offend</mark3><br>
Our Enemy, our own loss how <mark3>repair,</mark3><br>
How overcome this dire <mark4>Calamity,</mark4><br>
What reinforcement we may gain from <mark1>Hope,</mark1><br>
If not what resolution from <mark1>despare.</mark1><br>
<br>
Thus Satan to his neerest <mark4>Mate</mark4><br>
With Head up-lift above the wave, and <mark1>Eyes</mark1><br>
That sparkling blaz'd, his other Parts <mark1>besides</mark1><br>
Prone on the Flood, extended long and <mark4>large</mark4><br>
Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as <mark4>huge</mark4><br>
As whom the Fables name of monstrous <mark4>size,</mark4><br>
Titanian, or Earth-born, that warr'd on <mark1>Jove,</mark1><br>
Briareos or Typhon, whom the <mark4>Den</mark4><br>
By ancient Tarsus held, or that <mark4>Sea-beast</mark4><br>
Leviathan, which God of all his <mark4>works</mark4><br>
Created hugest that swim th' Ocean <mark4>stream:</mark4><br>
Him haply slumbring on the Norway <mark4>foam</mark4><br>
The Pilot of some small night-founder'd <mark4>Skiff,</mark4><br>
Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men <mark4>tell,</mark4><br>
With fixed Anchor in his skaly <mark4>rind</mark4><br>
Moors by his side under the Lee, while <mark1>Night</mark1><br>
Invests the Sea, and wished Morn <mark5>delayes:</mark5><br>
So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend <mark3>lay</mark3><br>
Chain'd on the burning Lake, nor ever <mark1>thence</mark1><br>
Had ris'n or heav'd his head, but that the <mark1>will</mark1><br>
And high permission of all-ruling <mark4>Heaven</mark4><br>
Left him at large to his own dark <mark4>designs,</mark4><br>
That with reiterated crimes he <mark1>might</mark1><br>
Heap on himself damnation, while he <mark4>sought</mark4><br>
Evil to others, and enrag'd might <mark3>see</mark3><br>
How all his malice serv'd but to bring <mark4>forth</mark4><br>
Infinite goodness, grace and mercy <mark5>shewn</mark5><br>
On Man by him seduc't, but on <mark4>himself</mark4><br>
Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance <mark4>pour'd.</mark4><br>
Forthwith upright he rears from off the <mark4>Pool</mark4><br>
His mighty Stature; on each hand the <mark1>flames</mark1><br>
Drivn backward slope thir pointing spires, and <mark5>rowld</mark5><br>
In billows, leave i'th'midst a horrid <mark4>Vale.</mark4><br>
Then with expanded wings he stears his <mark4>flight</mark4><br>
Aloft, incumbent on the dusky <mark3>Air</mark3><br>
That felt unusual weight, till on dry <mark4>Land</mark4><br>
He lights, as if it were Land that ever <mark4>burn'd</mark4><br>
With solid, as the Lake with liquid <mark1>fire;</mark1><br>
And such appear'd in hue, as when the <mark4>force</mark4><br>
Of subterranean wind transports a <mark1>Hill</mark1><br>
Torn from Pelorus, or the shatter'd <mark1>side</mark1><br>
Of thundring Aetna, whose <mark5>combustible</mark5><br>
And fewel'd entrals thence conceiving <mark1>Fire,</mark1><br>
Sublim'd with Mineral fury, aid the <mark4>Winds,</mark4><br>
And leave a singed bottom all <mark5>involv'd</mark5><br>
With stench and smoak: Such resting found the <mark4>sole</mark4><br>
Of unblest <mark4>feet</mark4>, Him followed his next <mark1>Mate,</mark1><br>
Both glorying to have scap't the Stygian <mark4>flood</mark4><br>
As Gods, and by thir own recover'd <mark4>strength,</mark4><br>
Not by the sufferance of supernal <mark1>Power.</mark1><br>
<br>
Is this the Region, this the Soil, the <mark1>Clime,</mark1><br>
Said then the lost Arch-Angel, this the <mark1>seat</mark1><br>
That we must change for Heav'n, this mournful <mark4>gloom</mark4><br>
For that celestial light?   Be it so, since <mark3>he</mark3><br>
Who now is Sovran can dispose and <mark4>bid</mark4><br>
What shall be right: fardest from him his <mark4>best</mark4><br>
Whom reason hath equald, force hath made <mark5>supream</mark5><br>
Above his <mark4>equals</mark4>, Farewel happy <mark4>Fields</mark4><br>
Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, <mark1>hail</mark1><br>
Infernal world, and thou profoundest <mark4>Hell</mark4><br>
Receive thy new Possessor:   One who <mark4>brings</mark4><br>
A mind not to be chang'd by Place or <mark4>Time.</mark4><br>
The mind is its own place, and in it <mark3>self</mark3><br>
Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of <mark1>Heav'n.</mark1><br>
What matter where, if I be still the <mark4>same,</mark4><br>
And what I should <mark3>be</mark3>, all but less then <mark1>he</mark1><br>
Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at <mark4>least</mark4><br>
We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not <mark4>built</mark4><br>
Here for his envy, will not drive us <mark4>hence:</mark4><br>
Here we may reign secure, and in my <mark4>choyce</mark4><br>
To reign is worth ambition though in <mark1>Hell:</mark1><br>
Better to reign in Hell, then serve in <mark1>Heav'n.</mark1><br>
But wherefore let we then our faithful <mark4>friends,</mark4><br>
Th' associates and copartners of our <mark4>loss</mark4><br>
Lye thus astonisht on th' oblivious <mark1>Pool,</mark1><br>
And call them not to share with us their <mark4>part</mark4><br>
In this unhappy Mansion, or once <mark4>more</mark4><br>
With rallied Arms to try what may be <mark4>yet</mark4><br>
Regaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in <mark1>Hell?</mark1><br>
<br>
So Satan spake, and him <mark5>Beelzebub</mark5><br>
Thus answer'd.   Leader of those Armies <mark4>bright,</mark4><br>
Which but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld, <br>
If once they hear that voyce, thir liveliest <mark4>pledge</mark4><br>
Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so <mark4>oft</mark4><br>
In worst extreams, and on the perilous <mark3>edge</mark3><br>
Of battel when it rag'd, in all <mark4>assaults</mark4><br>
Thir surest signal, they will soon <mark4>resume</mark4><br>
New courage and revive, though now they <mark3>lye</mark3><br>
Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of <mark1>Fire,</mark1><br>
As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd, <br>
No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious <mark5>highth.</mark5><br>
<br>
He scarce had ceas't when the superiour <mark4>Fiend</mark4><br>
Was moving toward the shoar; his ponderous <mark4>shield</mark4><br>
Ethereal temper, massy, large and <mark1>round,</mark1><br>
Behind him cast; the broad <mark4>circumference</mark4><br>
Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose <mark4>Orb</mark4><br>
Through Optic Glass the Tuscan Artist <mark1>views</mark1><br>
At Ev'ning from the top of Fesole, <br>
Or in Valdarno, to descry new <mark4>Lands,</mark4><br>
Rivers or Mountains in her spotty <mark4>Globe.</mark4><br>
His Spear, to equal which the tallest <mark4>Pine</mark4><br>
Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the <mark4>Mast</mark4><br>
Of some great Ammiral, were but a <mark4>wand,</mark4><br>
He walkt with to support uneasie <mark4>steps</mark4><br>
Over the burning Marle, not like those <mark1>steps</mark1><br>
On Heavens Azure, and the torrid <mark1>Clime</mark1><br>
Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with <mark1>Fire;</mark1><br>
Nathless he so endur'd, till on the <mark4>Beach</mark4><br>
Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and <mark4>call'd</mark4><br>
His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay <mark5>intrans't</mark5><br>
Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the <mark4>Brooks</mark4><br>
In Vallombrosa, where th' Etrurian <mark4>shades</mark4><br>
High overarch't imbowr; or scatterd <mark3>sedge</mark3><br>
Afloat, when with fierce Winds Orion <mark1>arm'd</mark1><br>
Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew <br>
Busirus and his Memphian <mark4>Chivalry,</mark4><br>
While with perfidious hatred they <mark5>pursu'd</mark5><br>
The Sojourners of Goshen, who <mark4>beheld</mark4><br>
From the safe shore thir floating Carkases <br>
And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick <mark5>bestrown</mark5><br>
Abject and lost lay these, covering the <mark1>Flood,</mark1><br>
Under amazement of thir hideous <mark1>change.</mark1><br>
He call'd so loud, that all the hollow <mark1>Deep</mark1><br>
Of Hell resounded. Princes, <mark4>Potentates</mark4><br>
Warriers, the Flowr of Heav'n, once yours, now <mark1>lost,</mark1><br>
If such astonishment as this can sieze <br>
Eternal <mark4>spirits</mark4>, or have ye chos'n this <mark4>place</mark4><br>
After the toyl of Battel to <mark4>repose</mark4><br>
Your wearied vertue, for the ease you <mark4>find</mark4><br>
To slumber here, as in the Vales of <mark1>Heav'n?</mark1><br>
Or in this abject posture have ye <mark4>sworn</mark4><br>
To adore the Conquerour?   who now <mark5>beholds</mark5><br>
Cherube and Seraph rowling in the <mark1>Flood</mark1><br>
With scatter'd Arms and Ensigns, till <mark1>anon</mark1><br>
His swift pursuers from Heav'n Gates <mark4>discern</mark4><br>
Th' advantage, and descending tread us <mark1>down</mark1><br>
Thus drooping, or with linked <mark5>Thunderbolts</mark5><br>
Transfix us to the bottom of this <mark1>Gulfe.</mark1><br>
Awake, <mark4>arise</mark4>, or be for ever <mark4>fall'n.</mark4><br>
<br>
They heard, and were abasht, and up they <mark4>sprung</mark4><br>
Upon the wing, as when men wont to <mark4>watch</mark4><br>
On duty, sleeping found by whom they <mark4>dread,</mark4><br>
Rouse and bestir themselves ere well <mark4>awake.</mark4><br>
Nor did they not perceave the evil <mark4>plight</mark4><br>
In which they were, or the fierce pains not <mark1>feel;</mark1><br>
Yet to thir Generals Voyce they soon obeyd <br>
Innumerable.   As when the potent <mark4>Rod</mark4><br>
Of Amrams Son in Egypts evill <mark3>day</mark3><br>
Wav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy <mark4>cloud</mark4><br>
Of Locusts, warping on the Eastern <mark4>Wind,</mark4><br>
That ore the Realm of impious Pharaoh <mark3>hung</mark3><br>
Like Night, and darken'd all the Land of <mark4>Nile:</mark4><br>
So numberless were those bad Angels <mark4>seen</mark4><br>
Hovering on wind under the Cope of <mark1>Hell</mark1><br>
'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding <mark4>Fires;</mark4><br>
Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted <mark4>Spear</mark4><br>
Of thir great Sultan waving to <mark4>direct</mark4><br>
Thir course, in even ballance down they <mark1>light</mark1><br>
On the firm <mark4>brimstone</mark4>, and fill all the <mark4>Plain;</mark4><br>
A multitude, like which the populous <mark4>North</mark4><br>
Pour'd never from her frozen loyns, to <mark4>pass</mark4><br>
Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous <mark4>Sons</mark4><br>
Came like a Deluge on the South, and <mark4>spread</mark4><br>
Beneath Gibralter to the Lybian <mark4>sands.</mark4><br>
Forthwith from every Squadron and each <mark4>Band</mark4><br>
The Heads and Leaders thither hast where <mark4>stood</mark4><br>
Thir great Commander; Godlike shapes and <mark4>forms</mark4><br>
Excelling human, Princely Dignities, <br>
And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones; <br>
Though of thir Names in heav'nly Records <mark1>now</mark1><br>
Be no memorial blotted out and <mark4>ras'd</mark4><br>
By thir Rebellion, from the Books of <mark4>Life.</mark4><br>
Nor had they yet among the Sons of <mark4>Eve</mark4><br>
Got them new Names, till wandring ore the <mark1>Earth,</mark1><br>
Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
By falsities and lyes the greatest <mark1>part</mark1><br>
Of Mankind they corrupted to <mark3>forsake</mark3><br>
God thir Creator, and th' <mark4>invisible</mark4><br>
Glory of him that made <mark4>them</mark4>, to <mark4>transform</mark4><br>
Oft to the Image of a Brute, <mark4>adorn'd</mark4><br>
With gay Religions full of Pomp and <mark4>Gold,</mark4><br>
And Devils to adore for <mark4>Deities:</mark4><br>
Then were they known to men by various <mark4>Names,</mark4><br>
And various Idols through the Heathen <mark4>World.</mark4><br>
Say, Muse, the Names then known, who <mark4>first</mark4>, who <mark4>last,</mark4><br>
Rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery <mark4>Couch,</mark4><br>
At thir great Emperors call, as next in <mark3>worth</mark3><br>
Came singly where he stood on the bare <mark4>strand,</mark4><br>
While the promiscuous croud stood yet <mark4>aloof?</mark4><br>
The chief were those who from the Pit of <mark1>Hell</mark1><br>
Roaming to seek thir prey on earth, durst <mark4>fix</mark4><br>
Thir Seats long after next the Seat of <mark1>God,</mark1><br>
Thir Altars by his Altar, Gods <mark4>ador'd</mark4><br>
Among the Nations <mark4>round</mark4>, and durst <mark4>abide</mark4><br>
Jehovah thundring out of Sion, <mark5>thron'd</mark5><br>
Between the Cherubim; yea, often <mark5>plac'd</mark5><br>
Within his Sanctuary it self thir <mark4>Shrines,</mark4><br>
<mark4>Abominations</mark4>, and with cursed <mark4>things</mark4><br>
His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts <mark5>profan'd,</mark5><br>
And with thir darkness durst affront his <mark1>light.</mark1><br>
First Moloch, horrid King besmear'd with <mark4>blood</mark4><br>
Of human sacrifice, and parents <mark4>tears,</mark4><br>
Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels <mark4>loud</mark4><br>
Thir childrens cries unheard, that past through <mark1>fire</mark1><br>
To his grim Idol.   Him the <mark4>Ammonite</mark4><br>
Worshipt in Rabba and her watry <mark1>Plain,</mark1><br>
In Argob and in Basan, to the <mark1>stream</mark1><br>
Of utmost Arnon.   Not content with <mark4>such</mark4><br>
Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
Of Solomon he led by fraud to <mark4>build</mark4><br>
His Temple right against the Temple of <mark1>God</mark1><br>
On that opprobrious Hill, and made his <mark4>Grove</mark4><br>
The pleasant Vally of Hinnom, Tophet <mark1>thence</mark1><br>
And black Gehenna call'd, the Type of <mark1>Hell.</mark1><br>
Next Chemos, th' obscene dread of Moabs <mark1>Sons,</mark1><br>
From Aroar to Nebo, and the <mark4>wild</mark4><br>
Of Southmost Abarim; in Hesebon <br>
And Heronaim, Seons Realm, <mark4>beyond</mark4><br>
The flowry Dale of Sibma clad with <mark4>Vines,</mark4><br>
And Eleale to th' Asphaltick <mark1>Pool.</mark1><br>
Peor his other Name, when he <mark5>entic'd</mark5><br>
Israel in Sittim on thir march from <mark1>Nile</mark1><br>
To do him wanton rites, which cost them <mark1>woe.</mark1><br>
Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'd <br>
Even to that Hill of scandal, but the <mark1>Grove</mark1><br>
Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by <mark1>hate;</mark1><br>
Till good Josiah drove them hence to <mark1>Hell.</mark1><br>
With these cam they, who from the bordring <mark1>flood</mark1><br>
Of old Euphrates to the Brook that <mark4>parts</mark4><br>
Egypt from Syrian ground, had general <mark1>names</mark1><br>
Of Baalim and Ashtaroth, those <mark4>male,</mark4><br>
These Feminine.   For Spirits when they <mark4>please</mark4><br>
Can either Sex assume, or both; so <mark4>soft</mark4><br>
And uncompounded is thir Essence <mark1>pure,</mark1><br>
Nor ti'd or manacl'd with joynt or <mark4>limb,</mark4><br>
Nor founded on the brittle strength of <mark4>bones,</mark4><br>
Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they <mark4>choose</mark4><br>
Dilated or condens't, bright or <mark3>obscure,</mark3><br>
Can execute thir aerie <mark4>purposes,</mark4><br>
And works of love or enmity <mark4>fulfill.</mark4><br>
For those the Race of Israel oft <mark4>forsook</mark4><br>
Thir living strength, and unfrequented <mark4>left</mark4><br>
His righteous Altar, bowing lowly <mark1>down</mark1><br>
To bestial Gods; for which thir heads as <mark1>low</mark1><br>
Bow'd down in Battel, sunk before the <mark1>Spear</mark1><br>
Of despicable foes.   With these in <mark4>troop</mark4><br>
Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians <mark1>call'd</mark1><br>
Astarte, Queen of Heav'n, with crescent <mark4>Horns;</mark4><br>
To whose bright Image nightly by the <mark4>Moon</mark4><br>
Sidonian Virgins paid thir Vows and <mark4>Songs,</mark4><br>
In Sion also not unsung, where <mark1>stood</mark1><br>
Her Temple on th' offensive Mountain, <mark1>built</mark1><br>
By that uxorious King, whose heart though <mark1>large,</mark1><br>
Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, <mark1>fell</mark1><br>
To idols foul.   Thammuz came next <mark4>behind,</mark4><br>
Whose annual wound in Lebanon allur'd <br>
The Syrian Damsels to lament his <mark1>fate</mark1><br>
In amorous dittyes all a Summers <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
While smooth Adonis from his native <mark4>Rock</mark4><br>
Ran purple to the Sea, suppos'd with <mark1>blood</mark1><br>
Of Thammuz yearly wounded; the <mark4>Love-tale</mark4><br>
Infected Sions daughters with like <mark4>heat,</mark4><br>
Whose wanton passions in the sacred <mark4>Porch</mark4><br>
Ezekial saw, when by the Vision <mark4>led</mark4><br>
His eye survay'd the dark Idolatries <br>
Of alienated Judah.   Next came <mark4>one</mark4><br>
Who mourn'd in earnest, when the Captive <mark4>Ark</mark4><br>
Maim'd his brute Image, head and hands lopt <mark1>off</mark1><br>
In his own Temple, on the grunsel <mark1>edge,</mark1><br>
Where he fell flat, and sham'd his <mark4>Worshipers:</mark4><br>
Dagon his Name, Sea Monster, upward <mark1>Man</mark1><br>
And downward Fish: yet had his Temple <mark1>high</mark1><br>
Rear'd in Azotus, dreaded through the <mark4>Coast</mark4><br>
Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon <br>
And Accaron and Gaza's frontier <mark4>bounds.</mark4><br>
Him follow'd Rimmon, whose delightful <mark1>Seat</mark1><br>
Was fair <mark4>Damascus</mark4>, on the fertil <mark4>Banks</mark4><br>
Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid <mark4>streams.</mark4><br>
He also against the house of God was <mark4>bold:</mark4><br>
A Leper once he lost and gain'd a <mark1>King,</mark1><br>
Ahaz his sottish Conquerour, whom he <mark3>drew</mark3><br>
Gods Altar to disparage and <mark4>displace</mark4><br>
For one of Syrian mode, whereon to <mark4>burn</mark4><br>
His odious offrings, and adore the <mark1>Gods</mark1><br>
Whom he had vanquisht.   After these <mark4>appear'd</mark4><br>
A crew who under Names of old <mark4>Renown,</mark4><br>
Osiris, Isis, Orus and thir <mark4>Train</mark4><br>
With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'd <br>
Fanatic Egypt and her Priests, to <mark4>seek</mark4><br>
Thir wandring Gods Disguis'd in brutish <mark1>forms</mark1><br>
Rather then human.   Nor did Israel <mark4>scape</mark4><br>
Th' infection when thir borrow'd Gold <mark5>compos'd</mark5><br>
The Calf in Oreb: and the Rebel <mark1>King</mark1><br>
Doubl'd that sin in Bethel and in <mark4>Dan,</mark4><br>
Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed <mark4>Ox,</mark4><br>
Jehovah, who in one Night when he <mark4>pass'd</mark4><br>
From Egypt marching, equal'd with one <mark4>stroke</mark4><br>
Both her first born and all her bleating <mark1>Gods</mark1><br>
Belial came last, then whom a Spirit more <mark4>lewd</mark4><br>
Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to <mark4>love</mark4><br>
Vice for it self: To him no Temple <mark1>stood</mark1><br>
Or Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then <mark2>hee</mark2><br>
In Temples and at Altars, when the <mark4>Priest</mark4><br>
Turns Atheist, as did Ely's <mark4>Sons</mark4>, who <mark4>fill'd</mark4><br>
With lust and violence the house of <mark1>God.</mark1><br>
In Courts and Palaces he also <mark4>Reigns</mark4><br>
And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse <br>
Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs, <br>
And injury and outrage: And when <mark1>Night</mark1><br>
Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the <mark1>Sons</mark1><br>
Of Belial, flown with insolence and <mark4>wine.</mark4><br>
Witness the Streets of Sodom, and that <mark1>night</mark1><br>
In Gibeah, when the hospitable <mark4>door</mark4><br>
Expos'd a Matron to avoid worse <mark3>rape.</mark3><br>
These were the prime in order and in <mark1>might;</mark1><br>
The rest were long to tell, though far <mark4>renown'd,</mark4><br>
Th' Ionian Gods, of Javans issue <mark4>held</mark4><br>
Gods, yet confest later then Heav'n and <mark1>Earth</mark1><br>
Thir boasted Parents; Titan Heav'ns first <mark4>born</mark4><br>
With his enormous brood, and birthright <mark4>seis'd</mark4><br>
By younger Saturn, he from mightier <mark1>Jove</mark1><br>
His own and Rhea's Son like measure <mark4>found;</mark4><br>
So Jove usurping reign'd: these first in Creet <br>
And Ida known, thence on the Snowy <mark1>top</mark1><br>
Of cold Olympus rul'd the middle <mark1>Air</mark1><br>
Thir highest Heav'n; or on the Delphian <mark4>Cliff,</mark4><br>
Or in Dodona, and through all the <mark1>bounds</mark1><br>
Of Doric <mark4>Land</mark4>, or who with Saturn <mark4>old</mark4><br>
Fled over Adria to th' Hesperian <mark1>Fields,</mark1><br>
And ore the Celtic roam'd the utmost <mark4>Isles.</mark4><br>
All these and more came flocking; but with <mark4>looks</mark4><br>
Down cast and damp, yet such wherein <mark1>appear'd</mark1><br>
Obscure some glimps of joy, to have found thir <mark4>chief</mark4><br>
Not in despair, to have found themselves not <mark1>lost</mark1><br>
In loss itself; which on his count'nance <mark4>cast</mark4><br>
Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted <mark1>pride</mark1><br>
Soon recollecting, with high words, that <mark4>bore</mark4><br>
Semblance of worth, not substance, gently <mark4>rais'd</mark4><br>
Thir fanting courage, and dispel'd thir <mark4>fears.</mark4><br>
Then strait commands that at the warlike <mark4>sound</mark4><br>
Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard <br>
His mighty Standard; that proud honour <mark4>claim'd</mark4><br>
Azazel as his right, a Cherube <mark4>tall:</mark4><br>
Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld <br>
Th' Imperial Ensign, which full high <mark1>advanc't</mark1><br>
Shon like a Meteor streaming to the <mark1>Wind</mark1><br>
With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz'd, <br>
Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the <mark4>while</mark4><br>
Sonorous mettal blowing Martial <mark4>sounds:</mark4><br>
At which the universal Host upsent <br>
A shout that tore Hells Concave, and <mark1>beyond</mark1><br>
Frighted the Reign of Chaos and old <mark1>Night.</mark1><br>
All in a moment through the gloom were <mark1>seen</mark1><br>
Ten thousand Banners rise into the <mark1>Air</mark1><br>
With Orient Colours waving: with them <mark4>rose</mark4><br>
A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging <mark4>Helms</mark4><br>
Appear'd, and serried Shields in thick <mark3>array</mark3><br>
Of depth immeasurable: Anon they <mark4>move</mark4><br>
In perfect Phalanx to the Dorian <mark4>mood</mark4><br>
Of Flutes and soft <mark4>Recorders</mark4>, such as <mark1>rais'd</mark1><br>
To hight of noblest temper Hero's <mark1>old</mark1><br>
Arming to Battel, and in stead of <mark1>rage</mark1><br>
Deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd <br>
With dread of death to flight or foul <mark4>retreat,</mark4><br>
Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage <br>
With solemn touches, troubl'd <mark4>thoughts</mark4>, and <mark4>chase</mark4><br>
Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and <mark1>pain</mark1><br>
From mortal or immortal minds.   Thus <mark3>they</mark3><br>
Breathing united force with fixed <mark1>thought</mark1><br>
Mov'd on in silence to soft Pipes that <mark4>charm'd</mark4><br>
Thir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and <mark1>now</mark1><br>
Advanc't in view, they stand, a horrid <mark4>Front</mark4><br>
Of dreadful length and dazling <mark4>Arms</mark4>, in <mark4>guise</mark4><br>
Of Warriers old with order'd Spear and <mark1>Shield,</mark1><br>
Awaiting what command thir mighty <mark1>Chief</mark1><br>
Had to impose: He through the armed <mark4>Files</mark4><br>
Darts his experienc't eye, and soon <mark4>traverse</mark4><br>
The whole Battalion views, thir order <mark3>due,</mark3><br>
Thir visages and stature as of <mark1>Gods,</mark1><br>
Thir number last he summs.   And now his <mark1>heart</mark1><br>
Distends with pride, and hardning in his <mark1>strength</mark1><br>
Glories: For never since created <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
Met such imbodied force, as nam'd with <mark4>these</mark4><br>
Could merit more then that small <mark4>infantry</mark4><br>
Warr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant <mark4>brood</mark4><br>
Of Phlegra with th' Heroic Race were <mark5>joyn'd</mark5><br>
That fought at Theb's and Ilium, on each <mark1>side</mark1><br>
Mixt with auxiliar Gods;   and what <mark5>resounds</mark5><br>
In Fable or Romance of Uthers <mark1>Sons</mark1><br>
Begirt with British and Armoric <mark4>Knights;</mark4><br>
And all who since Baptiz'd or <mark4>Infidel</mark4><br>
Jousted in Aspramont or <mark4>Montalban,</mark4><br>
Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond <br>
Or whom Biserta sent from Afric <mark4>shore</mark4><br>
When Charlemain with all his Peerage <mark1>fell</mark1><br>
By Fontarabbia.   Thus far these <mark1>beyond</mark1><br>
Compare of mortal prowess, yet <mark5>observ'd</mark5><br>
Thir dread commander: he above the <mark4>rest</mark4><br>
In shape and gesture proudly <mark4>eminent</mark4><br>
Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not <mark1>lost</mark1><br>
All her Original brightness, nor <mark1>appear'd</mark1><br>
Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th' <mark4>excess</mark4><br>
Of Glory obscur'd;   As when the Sun new ris'n <br>
Looks through the Horizontal misty <mark1>Air</mark1><br>
Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the <mark1>Moon</mark1><br>
In dim Eclips disastrous twilight <mark4>sheds</mark4><br>
On half the Nations, and with fear of <mark1>change</mark1><br>
Perplexes Monarch.   Dark'n'd so, yet <mark4>shon</mark4><br>
Above them all th' Arch Angel; but his <mark4>face</mark4><br>
Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and <mark3>care</mark3><br>
Sat on his faded cheek, but under <mark5>Browes</mark5><br>
Of dauntless courage, and considerate <mark1>Pride</mark1><br>
Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but <mark1>cast</mark1><br>
Signs of remorse and passion to <mark4>behold</mark4><br>
The fellows of his crime, the followers <mark4>rather</mark4><br>
(Far other once beheld in bliss) <mark4>condemn'd</mark4><br>
For ever now to have thir lot in <mark1>pain,</mark1><br>
Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc't <br>
Of Heav'n, and from Eternal Splendors <mark4>flung</mark4><br>
For his revolt, yet faithfull how they <mark1>stood,</mark1><br>
Thir Glory witherd.   As when Heavens <mark1>Fire</mark1><br>
Hath scath'd the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain <mark4>Pines,</mark4><br>
With singed top thir stately growth though <mark4>bare</mark4><br>
Stands on the blasted Heath.   He now <mark1>prepar'd</mark1><br>
To speak; whereat thir doubl'd Ranks they <mark4>bend</mark4><br>
From wing to wing, and half enclose him <mark1>round</mark1><br>
With all his Peers: attention held them <mark4>mute.</mark4><br>
Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spight of <mark1>scorn,</mark1><br>
Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at <mark1>last</mark1><br>
Words interwove with sighs found out thir <mark3>way.</mark3><br>
<br>
O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O <mark1>Powers</mark1><br>
Matchless, but with th' Almighty, and that <mark4>strife</mark4><br>
Was not inglorious, though th' event was <mark4>dire,</mark4><br>
As this place testifies, and this dire <mark1>change</mark1><br>
Hateful to utter: but what power of <mark1>mind</mark1><br>
Foreseeing or presaging, from the <mark4>Depth</mark4><br>
Of knowledge past or present, could have <mark4>fear'd,</mark4><br>
How such united force of Gods, how <mark1>such</mark1><br>
As stood like these, could ever know <mark4>repulse?</mark4><br>
For who can yet beleeve, though after <mark1>loss,</mark1><br>
That all these puissant Legions, whose <mark4>exile</mark4><br>
Hath emptied Heav'n, shall fail to <mark4>re-ascend</mark4><br>
Self-rais'd, and repossess thir native <mark1>seat?</mark1><br>
For mee be witness all the Host of <mark1>Heav'n,</mark1><br>
If counsels different, or danger <mark4>shun'd</mark4><br>
By mee, have lost our hopes.   But he who <mark1>reigns</mark1><br>
Monarch in Heav'n, till then as one <mark4>secure</mark4><br>
Sat on his Throne, upheld by old <mark4>repute,</mark4><br>
Consent or custome, and his Regal <mark1>State</mark1><br>
Put forth at full, but still his strength <mark4>conceal'd,</mark4><br>
Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our <mark4>fall.</mark4><br>
Henceforth his might we know, and know our <mark4>own</mark4><br>
So as not either to provoke, or <mark1>dread</mark1><br>
New warr, provok't; our better part <mark1>remains</mark1><br>
To work in close design, by fraud or <mark1>guile</mark1><br>
What force effected not: that he no <mark1>less</mark1><br>
At length from us may find, who <mark4>overcomes</mark4><br>
By force, hath overcome but half his <mark1>foe.</mark1><br>
Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so <mark3>rife</mark3><br>
There went a fame in Heav'n that he ere <mark4>long</mark4><br>
Intended to <mark4>create</mark4>, and therein <mark4>plant</mark4><br>
A generation, whom his choice <mark4>regard</mark4><br>
Should favour equal to the Sons of <mark1>Heaven:</mark1><br>
Thither, if but to pry, shall be <mark1>perhaps</mark1><br>
Our first eruption, thither or <mark4>elsewhere:</mark4><br>
For this Infernal Pit shall never <mark4>hold</mark4><br>
Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th' <mark1>Abyss</mark1><br>
Long under darkness cover.   But these <mark4>thoughts</mark4><br>
Full Counsel must mature: Peace is <mark5>despaird,</mark5><br>
For who can think Submission? Warr then, <mark1>Warr</mark1><br>
Open or understood must be <mark5>resolv'd.</mark5><br>
<br>
He spake: and to confirm his words, <mark3>out-flew</mark3><br>
Millions of flaming <mark4>swords</mark4>, drawn from the <mark4>thighs</mark4><br>
Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden <mark4>blaze</mark4><br>
Far round illumin'd hell: highly they <mark4>rag'd</mark4><br>
Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped <mark1>Arms</mark1><br>
Clash'd on thir sounding Shields the din of <mark2>war,</mark2><br>
Hurling defiance toward the Vault of <mark1>Heav'n.</mark1><br>
<br>
There stood a hill not far whose griesly <mark1>top</mark1><br>
Belch'd fire and rowling smoak; the rest <mark3>entire</mark3><br>
Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted <mark4>sign</mark4><br>
That in his womb was hid metallic <mark3>Ore,</mark3><br>
The work of Sulphur.   Thither wing'd with <mark4>speed</mark4><br>
A numerous Brigad <mark4>hasten'd</mark4>, As when <mark4>Bands</mark4><br>
Of Pioners with Spade and Pickax <mark1>arm'd</mark1><br>
Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a <mark4>Field,</mark4><br>
Or cast a Rampart.   Mammon led them <mark4>on,</mark4><br>
Mammon, the least erected Spirit that <mark1>fell</mark1><br>
From heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks and <mark1>thoughts</mark1><br>
Were always downward bent, admiring <mark1>more</mark1><br>
The riches of Heav'ns pavement, trod'n <mark1>Gold,</mark1><br>
Then aught divine or holy else <mark4>enjoy'd</mark4><br>
In vision beatific: by him <mark1>first</mark1><br>
Men also, and by his suggestion <mark4>taught</mark4><br>
Ransack'd the Center, and with impious <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
Rifl'd the bowels of thir mother <mark1>Earth</mark1><br>
For Treasures better hid.   Soon had his <mark1>crew</mark1><br>
Op'nd into the Hill a spacious <mark4>wound</mark4><br>
And dig'd out ribs of Gold.   Let none <mark4>admire</mark4><br>
That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may <mark1>best</mark1><br>
Deserve the precious bane.   And here let <mark1>those</mark1><br>
Who boast in mortal things, and wond'ring <mark1>tell</mark1><br>
Of Babel, and the works of Memphian <mark4>Kings</mark4><br>
Learn how thir greatest Monuments of <mark4>Fame,</mark4><br>
And Strength and Art are easily <mark4>out-done</mark4><br>
By Spirits reprobate, and in an <mark4>hour</mark4><br>
What in an age they with incessant toyle <br>
And hands innumerable scarce <mark4>perform.</mark4><br>
Nigh on the Plain in many cells <mark1>prepar'd</mark1><br>
That underneath had veins of liquid <mark1>fire</mark1><br>
Sluc'd from the Lake, a second <mark4>multitude</mark4><br>
With wond'rous Art found out the massie <mark1>Ore,</mark1><br>
Severing each kind, and scum'd the Bullion <mark4>dross:</mark4><br>
A third as soon had form'd within the <mark4>ground</mark4><br>
A various mould, and from the boyling <mark4>cells</mark4><br>
By strange conveyance fill'd each hollow <mark4>nook,</mark4><br>
As in an Organ from one blast of <mark1>wind</mark1><br>
To many a row of Pipes the sound-board <mark4>breaths.</mark4><br>
Anon out of the earth a Fabrick <mark1>huge</mark1><br>
Rose like an Exhalation, with the <mark1>sound</mark1><br>
Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices <mark4>sweet,</mark4><br>
Built like a Temple, where Pilasters <mark1>round</mark1><br>
Were set, and Doric pillars <mark4>overlaid</mark4><br>
With Golden Architrave; nor did there <mark4>want</mark4><br>
Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures <mark5>grav'n,</mark5><br>
The Roof was fretted Gold.   Not Babilon, <br>
Nor great Alcairo such magnificence <br>
Equal'd in all thir glories, to <mark5>inshrine</mark5><br>
Belus or Serapis thir Gods, or <mark1>seat</mark1><br>
Thir Kings, when Aegypt with Assyria <mark4>strove</mark4><br>
In wealth and luxurie.   Th' ascending <mark4>pile</mark4><br>
Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores <br>
Op'ning thir brazen foulds discover <mark4>wide</mark4><br>
Within, her ample spaces, o're the smooth <br>
And level pavement: from the arched <mark4>roof</mark4><br>
Pendant by suttle Magic many a <mark3>row</mark3><br>
Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets <mark1>fed</mark1><br>
With Naphtha and Asphaltus yeilded <mark1>light</mark1><br>
As from a sky.   The hasty <mark1>multitude</mark1><br>
Admiring <mark4>enter'd</mark4>, and the work some <mark4>praise</mark4><br>
And some the Architect: his hand was <mark4>known</mark4><br>
In Heav'n by many a Towred structure <mark1>high,</mark1><br>
Where Scepter'd Angels held thir <mark4>residence,</mark4><br>
And sat as Princes, whom the supreme <mark1>King</mark1><br>
Exalted to such power, and gave to <mark4>rule,</mark4><br>
Each in his Hierarchie, the Orders <mark1>bright.</mark1><br>
Nor was his name unheard or unador'd <br>
In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian <mark1>land</mark1><br>
Men call'd him Mulciber; and how he <mark1>fell</mark1><br>
From Heav'n, they fabl'd, thrown by angry <mark1>Jove</mark1><br>
Sheer o're the Chrystal Battlements; from <mark4>Morn</mark4><br>
To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy <mark1>Eve,</mark1><br>
A Summers day; and with the setting <mark4>Sun</mark4><br>
Dropt from the Zenith like a falling <mark4>Star,</mark4><br>
On Lemnos th' Aegaean Ile: thus they <mark4>relate,</mark4><br>
Erring; for he with this rebellious <mark4>rout</mark4><br>
Fell long before; nor aught avail'd him <mark1>now</mark1><br>
To have built in Heav'n high Towrs; nor did he <mark1>scape</mark1><br>
By all his Engins, but was headlong <mark4>sent</mark4><br>
With his industrious crew to build in <mark1>hell.</mark1><br>
Mean while the winged Haralds by <mark3>command</mark3><br>
Of Sovran power, with awful <mark4>Ceremony</mark4><br>
And Trumpets sound throughout the Host <mark4>proclaim</mark4><br>
A solemn Councel forthwith to be <mark1>held</mark1><br>
At Pandaemonium, the high <mark4>Capital</mark4><br>
Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons <mark1>call'd</mark1><br>
From every Band and squared <mark4>Regiment</mark4><br>
By place or choice the worthiest; they <mark1>anon</mark1><br>
With hunderds and with thousands trooping <mark3>came</mark3><br>
Attended: all access was throng'd, the <mark4>Gates</mark4><br>
And Porches wide, but chief the spacious <mark4>Hall</mark4><br>
(Though like a cover'd <mark4>field</mark4>, where Champions <mark1>bold</mark1><br>
Wont ride in arm'd, and at the Soldans <mark4>chair</mark4><br>
Defi'd the best of Panim <mark1>chivalry</mark1><br>
To mortal combat or carreer with <mark4>Lance)</mark4><br>
Thick swarm'd, both on the ground and in the <mark1>air,</mark1><br>
Brusht with the hiss of russling <mark4>wings</mark4>, As <mark4>Bees</mark4><br>
In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus <mark4>rides,</mark4><br>
Pour forth thir populous youth about the <mark4>Hive</mark4><br>
In <mark4>clusters</mark4>, they among fresh dews and <mark4>flowers</mark4><br>
Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed <mark4>Plank,</mark4><br>
The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel, <br>
New rub'd with Baum, expatiate and <mark3>confer</mark3><br>
Thir State affairs.   So thick the aerie <mark4>crowd</mark4><br>
Swarm'd and were straitn'd; till the Signal giv'n <br>
Behold a wonder! they but now who <mark5>seemd</mark5><br>
In bigness to surpass Earths Giant <mark1>Sons</mark1><br>
Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow <mark4>room</mark4><br>
Throng numberless, like that Pigmean <mark4>Race</mark4><br>
Beyond the Indian Mount, or Faerie <mark4>Elves,</mark4><br>
Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest <mark1>side</mark1><br>
Or Fountain some belated Peasant <mark4>sees,</mark4><br>
Or dreams he sees, while over-head the <mark1>Moon</mark1><br>
Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the <mark1>Earth</mark1><br>
Wheels her pale <mark4>course</mark4>, they on thir mirth and <mark4>dance</mark4><br>
Intent, with jocond Music charm his <mark4>ear;</mark4><br>
At once with joy and fear his heart <mark4>rebounds.</mark4><br>
Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest <mark1>forms</mark1><br>
Reduc'd thir shapes immense, and were at <mark1>large,</mark1><br>
Though without number still amidst the <mark1>Hall</mark1><br>
Of that infernal Court.   But far <mark4>within</mark4><br>
And in thir own dimensions like <mark4>themselves</mark4><br>
The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim <br>
In close recess and secret conclave <mark4>sat</mark4><br>
A thousand Demy-Gods on golden <mark4>seat's,</mark4><br>
Frequent and full.   After short silence <mark4>then</mark4><br>
And summons read, the great consult <mark1>began.</mark1><br>
