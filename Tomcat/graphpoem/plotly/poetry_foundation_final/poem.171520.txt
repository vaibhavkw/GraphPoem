Is it, <mark4>then</mark4>, your <mark4>opinion</mark4><br>
Women are putty in your <mark3>hands?</mark3><br>
Is this the face to launch <mark4>upon</mark4><br>
A thousand one night <mark3>stands?</mark3><br>
<br>
First, please, would you be so <mark3>kind</mark3><br>
As to define your <mark4>contribution</mark4><br>
To modern verse, the Western <mark3>mind</mark3><br>
And human <mark4>institutions?</mark4><br>
<br>
Where, where is the long, flowing <mark3>hair,</mark3><br>
The velvet suit, the broad bow <mark3>tie;</mark3><br>
Where is the other-worldly <mark3>air,</mark3><br>
Where the abstracted <mark3>eye?</mark3><br>
<br>
Describe the influence on your <mark4>verse</mark4><br>
Of Oscar Mudwarp's mighty <mark4>line,</mark4><br>
The theories of Susan Schmersch <br>
Or the spondee's <mark3>decline.</mark3><br>
<br>
You've labored to present us <mark3>with</mark3><br>
This mouse-sized volume; shall this <mark3>equal</mark3><br>
The epic glories of Joe <mark3>Smith?</mark3><br>
He's just brought out a <mark3>sequel.</mark3><br>
<br>
Where are the beard, the bongo <mark4>drums,</mark4><br>
Tattered T-shirt and grubby <mark4>sandals,</mark4><br>
As who, released from Iowa, <mark4>comes</mark4><br>
To tell of wondrous <mark4>scandals?</mark4><br>
<br>
Have you subversive, out of <mark3>date,</mark3><br>
Or controversial <mark4>ideas?</mark4><br>
And can you really pull your <mark3>weight</mark3><br>
Among such minds as <mark4>these?</mark4><br>
<br>
Ah, what avails the tenure <mark4>race,</mark4><br>
Ah, what the <mark3>Ph.D.,</mark3><br>
When all departments have a <mark3>place</mark3><br>
For nincompoops like <mark3>thee?</mark3><br>
