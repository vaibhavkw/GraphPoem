Title : Who Has Seen the Wind? <br>
Author : Christina Rossetti <br><br>

Who has seen the <mark1>wind?</mark1><br>
Neither I nor <mark3>you:</mark3><br>
But when the leaves hang trembling, <br>
The wind is passing <mark3>through.</mark3><br>
<br>
Who has seen the <mark1>wind?</mark1><br>
Neither you nor <mark3>I:</mark3><br>
But when the trees bow down their heads, <br>
The wind is passing <mark3>by.</mark3><br>
