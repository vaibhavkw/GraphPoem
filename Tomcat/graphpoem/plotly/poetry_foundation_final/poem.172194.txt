Title : My skeleton, my rival <br>
Author : David Ignatow <br><br>

Interesting that I have to live with my <mark4>skeleton.</mark4><br>
It stands, prepared to emerge, and I carry <mark4>it</mark4><br>
with me--this other thing I will become at <mark4>death,</mark4><br>
and yet it keeps me erect and limber in my <mark4>walk,</mark4><br>
my <mark4>rival.</mark4><br>
<br>
What will the living see of <mark1>me</mark1><br>
if they should open my grave but my <mark4>bones</mark4><br>
that will stare at them through hollow <mark4>sockets</mark4><br>
and bared <mark4>teeth.</mark4><br>
<br>
I write this to warn my <mark4>friends</mark4><br>
not to be shocked at my changed <mark4>attitude</mark4><br>
toward them, but to be aware <br>
that I have it in me to be <mark4>someone</mark4><br>
other than I am, and I write to ask <mark4>forgiveness</mark4><br>
that death is not wholesome for <mark4>friendships,</mark4><br>
that bones do not talk, have no quarrel with <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
do not even know I <mark4>exist.</mark4><br>
<br>
A machine called skeleton will take my <mark4>place</mark4><br>
in the minds of others when I am <mark4>dead</mark4><br>
among the living, and that <mark4>machine</mark4><br>
will make it obvious that I have <mark4>died</mark4><br>
to be identified by <mark1>bones</mark1><br>
that have no speech, no thought, no <mark4>mind</mark4><br>
to speak of having let themselves be <mark4>carried</mark4><br>
once around in me, as at my <mark4>service</mark4><br>
at the podium or as I lay beside my <mark1>love</mark1><br>
or when I held my child at <mark4>birth</mark4><br>
or embraced a friend or shook a critic's <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
or held a pen to sign a check or <mark4>book</mark4><br>
or wrote a farewell letter to a <mark1>love</mark1><br>
or held my penis at the <mark4>bowl</mark4><br>
or lay my hand upon my face at the mirror   <br>
and approved of <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
<br>
There is Ignatow, it will be <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
looking down inside the open <mark4>grave.</mark4><br>
I'll be somewhere in my poems, I <mark4>think,</mark4><br>
to be mistaken for my bones, but There's Ignatow   <br>
will be said. I say to those who <mark4>persist,</mark4><br>
just read what I have <mark4>written.</mark4><br>
I'll be there, held together by another <mark4>kind</mark4><br>
of structure, of thought and imagery, <br>
mind and matter, love and longing, <mark4>tensions</mark4><br>
opposite, such as the skeleton <mark4>requires</mark4><br>
to stand upright, to move with <mark4>speed,</mark4><br>
to sit with confidence, my friend the <mark1>skeleton</mark1><br>
and I its friend, shielding it from harm. <br>
