Title : from The Task, Book VI: The Winter Walk at Noon <br>
Author : William Cowper <br><br>

<br>
Thus heav'n-ward all things tend. For all were <mark4>once</mark4><br>
Perfect, and all must be at length restor'd. <br>
So God has greatly purpos'd; who would <mark4>else</mark4><br>
In his dishonour'd works himself <mark4>endure</mark4><br>
Dishonour, and be wrong'd without <mark4>redress.</mark4><br>
Haste then, and wheel away a shatter'd <mark4>world,</mark4><br>
Ye slow-revolving seasons! we would <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
(A sight to which our eyes are strangers <mark4>yet)</mark4><br>
A world that does not dread and hate his <mark4>laws,</mark4><br>
And suffer for its crime; would learn how <mark4>fair</mark4><br>
The creature is that God pronounces <mark4>good,</mark4><br>
How pleasant in itself what pleases <mark4>him.</mark4><br>
Here ev'ry drop of honey hides a <mark4>sting,</mark4><br>
Worms wind themselves into our sweetest <mark4>flow'rs,</mark4><br>
And ev'n the joy that haply some poor <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
Derives from heav'n, pure as the <mark4>fountain</mark4><br>
Is sully'd in the stream; taking a <mark4>taint</mark4><br>
From touch of human lips, at best <mark4>impure.</mark4><br>
Oh for a world in principle as <mark4>chaste</mark4><br>
As this is gross and selfish! over <mark4>which</mark4><br>
Custom and prejudice shall bear no <mark3>sway,</mark3><br>
That govern all things here, should'ring <mark4>aside</mark4><br>
The meek and modest truth, and forcing her <br>
To seek a refuge from the tongue of <mark5>strife</mark5><br>
In nooks obscure, far from the ways of <mark4>men:</mark4><br>
Where violence shall never lift the <mark4>sword,</mark4><br>
Nor cunning justify the proud man's <mark4>wrong,</mark4><br>
Leaving the poor no remedy but <mark4>tears:</mark4><br>
Where he that fills an office, shall <mark4>esteem</mark4><br>
Th' occasion it presents of doing <mark1>good</mark1><br>
More than the perquisite: Where law shall <mark4>speak</mark4><br>
Seldom, and never but as wisdom <mark4>prompts</mark4><br>
And equity; not jealous more to <mark4>guard</mark4><br>
A worthless form, than to decide aright: <br>
Where fashion shall not sanctify <mark4>abuse,</mark4><br>
Nor smooth good-breeding (supplemental <mark4>grace)</mark4><br>
With lean performance ape the work of love. <br>
<br>
. . <mark1>.</mark1><br>
<br>
   He is the happy man, whose life ev'n now <br>
Shows somewhat of that happier life to <mark4>come;</mark4><br>
Who, doom'd to an obscure but tranquil <mark4>state,</mark4><br>
Is pleas'd with it, and, were he free to <mark3>chuse,</mark3><br>
Would make his fate his choice; whom peace, the <mark4>fruit</mark4><br>
Of virtue, and whom virtue, fruit of <mark5>faith,</mark5><br>
Prepare for happiness; bespeak him <mark4>one</mark4><br>
Content indeed to sojourn while he <mark4>must</mark4><br>
Below the skies, but having there his <mark4>home.</mark4><br>
The world o'erlooks him in her busy <mark4>search</mark4><br>
Of objects more illustrious in her <mark3>view;</mark3><br>
And, occupy'd as earnestly as <mark3>she,</mark3><br>
Though more sublimely, he o'erlooks the <mark1>world.</mark1><br>
She scorns his pleasures, for she knows them <mark4>not;</mark4><br>
He seeks not hers, for he has prov'd them <mark4>vain.</mark4><br>
He cannot skim the ground like summer <mark4>birds</mark4><br>
Pursuing gilded <mark4>flies</mark4>, and such he <mark4>deems</mark4><br>
Her honors, her emoluments, her <mark4>joys.</mark4><br>
Therefore in contemplation is his <mark4>bliss,</mark4><br>
Whose pow'r is such, that whom she lifts from <mark4>earth</mark4><br>
She makes familiar with a heav'n <mark4>unseen,</mark4><br>
And shows him glories yet to be <mark4>reveal'd.</mark4><br>
<br>
. . <mark1>.</mark1><br>
<br>
So life glides smoothly and by stealth <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
More golden than that age of fabled <mark4>gold</mark4><br>
Renown'd in ancient song; not vex'd with <mark4>care</mark4><br>
Or stain'd with guilt, beneficent, approv'd <br>
Of God and man, and peaceful in its <mark4>end.</mark4><br>
So glide my life away! and so at <mark4>last,</mark4><br>
My share of duties decently <mark4>fulfill'd,</mark4><br>
May some disease, not tardy to <mark4>perform</mark4><br>
Its destin'd office, yet with gentle <mark4>stroke,</mark4><br>
Dismiss me weary to a safe <mark4>retreat,</mark4><br>
Beneath a turf that I have often <mark4>trod.</mark4><br>
It shall not grieve me, then, that once, when <mark4>call'd</mark4><br>
To dress a Sofa with the flow'rs of <mark4>verse,</mark4><br>
I play'd awhile, obedient to the <mark1>fair,</mark1><br>
With that light task; but soon, to please her <mark4>more</mark4><br>
Whom flow'rs alone I knew would little <mark4>please,</mark4><br>
Let fall th' unfinish'd wreath, and rov'd for <mark1>fruit;</mark1><br>
Rov'd far, and gather'd much: some harsh, 'tis <mark3>true,</mark3><br>
Pick'd from the thorns and briars of reproof, <br>
But wholesome, well-digested; grateful <mark4>some</mark4><br>
To palates that can taste immortal <mark4>truth,</mark4><br>
Insipid else, and sure to be despis'd. <br>
But all is in his hand whose praise I <mark4>seek.</mark4><br>
In vain the poet <mark4>sings</mark4>, and the world <mark4>hears,</mark4><br>
If he regard not, though divine the <mark4>theme.</mark4><br>
'Tis not in artful measures, in the <mark4>chime</mark4><br>
And idle tinkling of a minstrel's <mark4>lyre,</mark4><br>
To charm his ear, whose eye is on the <mark1>heart;</mark1><br>
Whose frown can disappoint the proudest <mark4>strain,</mark4><br>
Whose approbation--prosper even <mark4>mine.</mark4><br>
