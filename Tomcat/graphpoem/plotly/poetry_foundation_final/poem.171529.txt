Title : The Wheel Revolves <br>
Author : Kenneth Rexroth <br><br>

You were a girl of satin and <mark4>gauze</mark4><br>
Now you are my mountain and waterfall <mark4>companion.</mark4><br>
Long ago I read those lines of Po Chu I   <br>
Written in his middle <mark1>age.</mark1><br>
Young as I was they touched me. <br>
I never thought in my own middle <mark1>age</mark1><br>
I would have a beautiful young <mark4>dancer</mark4><br>
To wander with me by falling crystal <mark4>waters,</mark4><br>
Among mountains of snow and <mark4>granite,</mark4><br>
Least of all that unlike Po's <mark3>girl</mark3><br>
She would be my very <mark4>daughter.</mark4><br>
<br>
The earth turns towards the <mark4>sun.</mark4><br>
Summer comes to the <mark4>mountains.</mark4><br>
Blue grouse drum in the red fir <mark4>woods</mark4><br>
All the bright long <mark4>days.</mark4><br>
You put blue jay and flicker <mark4>feathers</mark4><br>
In your hair. <br>
Two and two violet green <mark4>swallows</mark4><br>
Play over the <mark4>lake.</mark4><br>
The blue birds have come <mark4>back</mark4><br>
To nest on the little <mark4>island.</mark4><br>
The swallows sip water on the <mark5>wing</mark5><br>
And play at love and dodge and swoop <br>
Just like the swallows that <mark3>swirl</mark3><br>
Under and over the Ponte Vecchio.   <br>
Light rain crosses the <mark1>lake</mark1><br>
Hissing faintly. After the <mark4>rain</mark4><br>
There are giant puffballs with tortoise shell <mark5>backs</mark5><br>
At the edge of the meadow. <br>
Snows of a thousand <mark4>winters</mark4><br>
Melt in the sun of one <mark4>summer.</mark4><br>
Wild cyclamen bloom by the stream.   <br>
Trout veer in the transparent <mark4>current.</mark4><br>
In the evening marmots bark in the <mark4>rocks.</mark4><br>
The Scorpion curls over the glimmering ice <mark4>field.</mark4><br>
A white crowned night sparrow sings as the moon <mark4>sets.</mark4><br>
Thunder growls far off. <br>
Our campfire is a single <mark4>light</mark4><br>
Amongst a hundred peaks and <mark4>waterfalls.</mark4><br>
The manifold voices of falling <mark4>water</mark4><br>
Talk all <mark3>night.</mark3><br>
Wrapped in your down bag   <br>
Starlight on your cheeks and <mark4>eyelids</mark4><br>
Your breath comes and <mark4>goes</mark4><br>
In a tiny cloud in the frosty <mark1>night.</mark1><br>
Ten thousand birds sing in the <mark4>sunrise.</mark4><br>
Ten thousand years revolve without <mark4>change.</mark4><br>
All this will never be <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
