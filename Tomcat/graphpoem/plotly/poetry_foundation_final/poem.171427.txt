Title : The Sheep Child <br>
Author : James L. Dickey <br><br>

Farm boys wild to <mark4>couple</mark4><br>
With anything      with soft-wooded <mark4>trees</mark4><br>
With mounds of earth      <mark4>mounds</mark4><br>
Of pinestraw      will keep themselves <mark4>off</mark4><br>
Animals by legends of their <mark4>own:</mark4><br>
In the hay-tunnel <mark4>dark</mark4><br>
And dung of barns, they <mark4>will</mark4><br>
Say    I have heard <mark4>tell</mark4><br>
<br>
That in a museum in Atlanta   <br>
Way back in a corner <mark4>somewhere</mark4><br>
There's this thing that's only <mark4>half</mark4><br>
Sheep      like a woolly <mark4>baby</mark4><br>
Pickled in alcohol      <mark4>because</mark4><br>
Those things can't live.      his <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
Are open      but you can't stand to <mark4>look</mark4><br>
I heard from somebody who <mark3>...</mark3><br>
<br>
But this is now almost <mark4>all</mark4><br>
<mark4>Gone</mark4>, The boys have <mark4>taken</mark4><br>
Their own true wives in the <mark4>city,</mark4><br>
The sheep are safe in the west <mark4>hill</mark4><br>
Pasture      but we who were born <mark4>there</mark4><br>
Still are not sure. Are <mark3>we,</mark3><br>
Because we remember, <mark4>remembered</mark4><br>
In the terrible dust of <mark4>museums?</mark4><br>
<br>
Merely with his eyes, the sheep-child may   <br>
<br>
Be saying      <mark4>saying</mark4><br>
<br>
I am here, in my father's <mark4>house.</mark4><br>
I who am half of your world, came <mark4>deeply</mark4><br>
To my mother in the long <mark4>grass</mark4><br>
Of the west pasture, where she stood like <mark4>moonlight</mark4><br>
         Listening for foxes. It was something like love <br>
         From another world that seized her <br>
From behind, and she gave, not lifting her <mark4>head</mark4><br>
Out of dew, without ever looking, her <mark4>best</mark4><br>
Self to that great need. Turned <mark4>loose</mark4>, she dipped her <mark4>face</mark4><br>
Farther into the chill of the earth, and in a <mark4>sound</mark4><br>
Of sobbing      of something <mark4>stumbling</mark4><br>
Away, began, as she must <mark3>do,</mark3><br>
To carry me. I woke, <mark4>dying,</mark4><br>
<br>
In the summer sun of the hillside, with my <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
Far more than human. I saw for a blazing <mark4>moment</mark4><br>
The great grassy world from both <mark4>sides,</mark4><br>
Man and beast in the round of their <mark4>need,</mark4><br>
And the hill wind stirred in my <mark4>wool,</mark4><br>
My hoof and my hand clasped each <mark4>other,</mark4><br>
I ate my one <mark4>meal</mark4><br>
Of milk, and <mark4>died</mark4><br>
Staring. From dark grass I came <mark4>straight</mark4><br>
<br>
To my father's house, whose <mark4>dust</mark4><br>
Whirls up in the halls for no <mark4>reason</mark4><br>
When no one comes      piling deep in a hellish mild <mark4>corner,</mark4><br>
And, through my immortal <mark4>waters,</mark4><br>
I meet the sun's grains <mark5>eye</mark5><br>
To eye, and they fail at my closet of <mark4>glass.</mark4><br>
Dead, I am most surely <mark4>living</mark4><br>
In the minds of farm boys: I am he who <mark4>drives</mark4><br>
Them like wolves from the hound bitch and <mark3>calf</mark3><br>
And from the chaste ewe in the <mark4>wind.</mark4><br>
         They go into woods      into bean fields      they go <br>
Deep into their known right hands. Dreaming of <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
They groan      they wait      they <mark4>suffer</mark4><br>
Themselves, they marry, they raise their <mark3>kind.</mark3><br>
