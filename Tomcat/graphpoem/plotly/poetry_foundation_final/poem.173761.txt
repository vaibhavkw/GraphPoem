Title : Prayer of a Soldier in France <br>
Author : Joyce Kilmer <br><br>

My shoulders ache beneath my <mark3>pack</mark3><br>
(Lie easier, Cross, upon His <mark3>back).</mark3><br>
<br>
I march with feet that burn and <mark3>smart</mark3><br>
(Tread, Holy <mark4>Feet</mark4>, upon my <mark3>heart).</mark3><br>
<br>
Men shout at me who may not <mark4>speak</mark4><br>
(They scourged Thy back and smote Thy <mark3>cheek).</mark3><br>
<br>
I may not lift a hand to <mark3>clear</mark3><br>
My eyes of salty drops that <mark3>sear.</mark3><br>
<br>
(Then shall my fickle soul <mark4>forget</mark4><br>
Thy agony of Bloody <mark3>Sweat?)</mark3><br>
<br>
My rifle hand is stiff and <mark3>numb</mark3><br>
(From Thy pierced palm red rivers <mark3>come).</mark3><br>
<br>
Lord, Thou didst suffer more for <mark3>me</mark3><br>
Than all the hosts of land and <mark3>sea.</mark3><br>
<br>
So let me render back <mark3>again</mark3><br>
This millionth of Thy gift. <mark3>Amen.</mark3><br>
