Title : The Little Match Girl <br>
Author : Knight of the White Elephant of Burmah William McGonagall <br><br>

It was biting cold, and the falling <mark3>snow,</mark3><br>
Which filled a poor little match girl's heart with <mark3>woe,</mark3><br>
Who was bareheaded and barefooted, as she went along the <mark3>street,</mark3><br>
Crying, "Who'll buy my matches? for I want pennies to buy some <mark3>meat!"</mark3><br>
<br>
When she left home she had slippers <mark3>on;</mark3><br>
But, alas! poor child, now they were <mark3>gone.</mark3><br>
For she lost both of them while hurrying across the <mark1>street,</mark1><br>
Out of the way of two carriages which were near by her <mark3>feet.</mark3><br>
<br>
So the little girl went on, while the snow fell thick and <mark4>fast;</mark4><br>
And the child's heart felt cold and <mark4>downcast,</mark4><br>
For nobody had bought any matches that <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
Which filled her little mind with grief and <mark3>dismay.</mark3><br>
<br>
Alas! she was hungry and shivering with <mark3>cold;</mark3><br>
So in a corner between two houses she made <mark3>bold</mark3><br>
To take shelter from the violent <mark4>storm.</mark4><br>
Poor little waif! wishing to herself she'd never been <mark4>born.</mark4><br>
<br>
And she grew colder and colder, and feared to go <mark4>home</mark4><br>
For fear of her father beating her; and she felt <mark4>woe-begone</mark4><br>
Because she could carry home no pennies to buy <mark4>bread,</mark4><br>
And to go home without pennies she was in <mark3>dread.</mark3><br>
<br>
The large flakes of snow covered her ringlets of fair <mark3>hair;</mark3><br>
While the passers-by for her had no <mark3>care,</mark3><br>
As they hurried along to their homes at a quick <mark3>pace,</mark3><br>
While the cold wind blew in the match girl's <mark3>face.</mark3><br>
<br>
As night wore on her hands were numb with <mark1>cold,</mark1><br>
And no longer her strength could her <mark3>uphold,</mark3><br>
When an idea into her little head <mark4>came:</mark4><br>
She'd strike a match and warm her hands at the <mark3>flame.</mark3><br>
<br>
And she lighted the match, and it burned brightly, <br>
And it helped to fill her heart with glee; <br>
And she thought she was sitting at a stove very <mark4>grand;</mark4><br>
But, alas! she was found <mark4>dead</mark4>, with a match in her <mark3>hand!</mark3><br>
<br>
Her body was found half-covered with <mark1>snow,</mark1><br>
And as the people gazed thereon their hearts were full of <mark1>woe;</mark1><br>
And many present let fall a burning <mark3>tear</mark3><br>
Because she was found dead on the last night of the <mark3>year,</mark3><br>
<br>
In that mighty city of London, wherein is plenty of <mark4>gold--</mark4><br>
But, alas! their charity towards street waifs is rather <mark1>cold.</mark1><br>
But I hope the match girl's in Heaven, beside her Saviour <mark3>dear,</mark3><br>
A bright reward for all the hardships she suffered <mark4>here.</mark4><br>
