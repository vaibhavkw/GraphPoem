Title : On Quitting <br>
Author : Edgar Albert Guest <br><br>

How much grit do you think you've <mark3>got?</mark3><br>
Can you quit a thing that you like a <mark3>lot?</mark3><br>
You may talk of pluck; it's an easy <mark3>word,</mark3><br>
And where'er you go it is often <mark3>heard;</mark3><br>
But can you tell to a jot or <mark3>guess</mark3><br>
Just how much courage you now <mark3>possess?</mark3><br>
<br>
You may stand to trouble and keep your <mark4>grin,</mark4><br>
But have you tackled <mark4>self-discipline?</mark4><br>
Have you ever issued commands to <mark3>you</mark3><br>
To quit the things that you like to <mark3>do,</mark3><br>
And then, when tempted and sorely <mark4>swayed,</mark4><br>
Those rigid orders have you <mark3>obeyed?</mark3><br>
<br>
Don't boast of your grit till you've tried it <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
Nor prate to men of your courage <mark3>stout,</mark3><br>
For it's easy enough to retain a <mark1>grin</mark1><br>
In the face of a fight there's a chance to <mark3>win,</mark3><br>
But the sort of grit that is good to <mark4>own</mark4><br>
Is the stuff you need when you're all <mark3>alone.</mark3><br>
<br>
How much grit do you think you've <mark1>got?</mark1><br>
Can you turn from joys that you like a <mark1>lot?</mark1><br>
Have you ever tested yourself to <mark3>know</mark3><br>
How far with yourself your will can <mark3>go?</mark3><br>
If you want to know if you have <mark4>grit,</mark4><br>
Just pick out a joy that you like, and <mark3>quit.</mark3><br>
<br>
It's bully sport and it's open <mark4>fight;</mark4><br>
It will keep you busy both day and <mark3>night;</mark3><br>
For the toughest kind of a game you'll <mark4>find</mark4><br>
Is to make your body obey your <mark3>mind.</mark3><br>
And you never will know what is meant by <mark1>grit</mark1><br>
Unless there's something you've tried to <mark1>quit.</mark1><br>
