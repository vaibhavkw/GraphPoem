Title : Home-Thoughts, from Abroad <br>
Author : Robert Browning <br><br>

Oh, to be in <mark1>England</mark1><br>
Now that April's <mark3>there,</mark3><br>
And whoever wakes in <mark1>England</mark1><br>
Sees, some morning, <mark3>unaware,</mark3><br>
That the lowest boughs and the brushwood <mark3>sheaf</mark3><br>
Round the elm-tree bole are in tiny <mark3>leaf,</mark3><br>
While the chaffinch sings on the orchard bough<br>
In <mark5>England--now!</mark5><br>
<br>
And after April, when May <mark3>follows,</mark3><br>
And the whitethroat <mark4>builds</mark4>, and all the <mark3>swallows!</mark3><br>
Hark, where my blossomed pear-tree in the <mark3>hedge</mark3><br>
Leans to the field and scatters on the <mark3>clover</mark3><br>
Blossoms and dewdrops--at the bent spray's <mark3>edge--</mark3><br>
That's the wise thrush; he sings each song twice <mark3>over,</mark3><br>
Lest you should think he never could <mark4>recapture</mark4><br>
The first fine careless <mark3>rapture!</mark3><br>
And though the fields look rough with hoary <mark3>dew,</mark3><br>
All will be gay when noontide wakes <mark3>anew</mark3><br>
The buttercups, the little children's <mark4>dower</mark4><br>
--Far brighter than this gaudy <mark4>melon-flower!</mark4><br>
