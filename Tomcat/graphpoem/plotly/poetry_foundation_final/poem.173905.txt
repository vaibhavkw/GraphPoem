Title : Morituri Salutamus: Poem for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Class of 1825 in Bowdoin College <br>
Author : Henry Wadsworth Longfellow <br><br>

Tempora labuntur, tacitisque senescimus annis, Et fugiunt freno non remorante dies.  Ovid, Fastorum, Lib. <mark3>vi.</mark3><br>
"O Caesar, we who are about to <mark3>die</mark3><br>
Salute you!" was the gladiators' <mark3>cry</mark3><br>
In the arena, standing face to <mark4>face</mark4><br>
With death and with the Roman <mark4>populace.</mark4><br>
<br>
O ye familiar scenes,--ye groves of <mark3>pine,</mark3><br>
That once were mine and are no longer <mark3>mine,--</mark3><br>
Thou river, widening through the meadows <mark4>green</mark4><br>
To the vast sea, so near and yet <mark3>unseen,--</mark3><br>
Ye <mark4>halls</mark4>, in whose seclusion and <mark4>repose</mark4><br>
<br>
Phantoms of fame, like exhalations, <mark3>rose</mark3><br>
And vanished,--we who are about to <mark1>die,</mark1><br>
Salute you; earth and air and sea and <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
And the Imperial Sun that scatters <mark4>down</mark4><br>
His sovereign splendors upon grove and <mark3>town.</mark3><br>
<br>
Ye do not answer us! ye do not <mark4>hear!</mark4><br>
We are forgotten; and in your <mark4>austere</mark4><br>
And calm indifference, ye little <mark4>care</mark4><br>
Whether we come or go, or whence or <mark3>where.</mark3><br>
What passing generations fill these <mark4>halls,</mark4><br>
What passing voices echo from these <mark3>walls,</mark3><br>
Ye heed <mark4>not</mark4>, we are only as the <mark4>blast,</mark4><br>
A moment heard, and then forever <mark3>past.</mark3><br>
<br>
Not so the teachers who in earlier <mark4>days</mark4><br>
Led our bewildered feet through learning's <mark3>maze;</mark3><br>
They answer us--alas! what have I <mark3>said?</mark3><br>
What greetings come there from the voiceless <mark3>dead?</mark3><br>
What salutation, welcome, or <mark3>reply?</mark3><br>
What pressure from the hands that lifeless <mark3>lie?</mark3><br>
They are no longer here; they all are <mark4>gone</mark4><br>
Into the land of shadows,--all save <mark4>one.</mark4><br>
Honor and reverence, and the good <mark4>repute</mark4><br>
That follows faithful service as its <mark3>fruit,</mark3><br>
Be unto him, whom living we <mark3>salute.</mark3><br>
<br>
The great Italian poet, when he <mark4>made</mark4><br>
His dreadful journey to the realms of <mark3>shade,</mark3><br>
Met there the old instructor of his <mark3>youth,</mark3><br>
And cried in tones of pity and of <mark3>ruth:</mark3><br>
"Oh, never from the memory of my <mark4>heart</mark4><br>
<br>
Your dear, paternal image shall <mark3>depart,</mark3><br>
Who while on earth, ere yet by death <mark4>surprised,</mark4><br>
Taught me how mortals are <mark4>immortalized;</mark4><br>
How grateful am I for that patient <mark1>care</mark1><br>
All my life long my language shall <mark3>declare."</mark3><br>
<br>
To-day we make the poet's words our <mark4>own,</mark4><br>
And utter them in plaintive <mark4>undertone;</mark4><br>
Nor to the living only be they <mark1>said,</mark1><br>
But to the other living called the <mark1>dead,</mark1><br>
Whose <mark3>dear</mark3>, paternal images <mark4>appear</mark4><br>
Not wrapped in gloom, but robed in sunshine <mark4>here;</mark4><br>
Whose simple lives, complete and without <mark3>flaw,</mark3><br>
Were part and parcel of great Nature's <mark3>law;</mark3><br>
Who said not to their <mark4>Lord</mark4>, as if <mark4>afraid,</mark4><br>
"Here is thy talent in a napkin <mark3>laid,"</mark3><br>
But labored in their sphere, as men who <mark3>live</mark3><br>
In the delight that work alone can <mark3>give.</mark3><br>
Peace be to them; eternal peace and <mark4>rest,</mark4><br>
And the fulfilment of the great <mark3>behest:</mark3><br>
"Ye have been faithful over a few <mark4>things,</mark4><br>
Over ten cities shall ye reign as <mark3>kings."</mark3><br>
<br>
And ye who fill the places we once <mark4>filled,</mark4><br>
And follow in the furrows that we tilled, <br>
Young men, whose generous hearts are beating <mark3>high,</mark3><br>
We who are old, and are about to <mark1>die,</mark1><br>
Salute you; hail you; take your hands in <mark4>ours,</mark4><br>
And crown you with our welcome as with <mark3>flowers!</mark3><br>
<br>
How beautiful is youth! how bright it <mark4>gleams</mark4><br>
With its illusions, <mark4>aspirations</mark4>, <mark3>dreams!</mark3><br>
Book of Beginnings, Story without <mark4>End,</mark4><br>
Each maid a heroine, and each man a <mark3>friend!</mark3><br>
Aladdin's Lamp, and Fortunatus' <mark4>Purse,</mark4><br>
That holds the treasures of the <mark4>universe!</mark4><br>
All possibilities are in its <mark4>hands,</mark4><br>
No danger daunts it, and no foe <mark3>withstands;</mark3><br>
In its sublime audacity of <mark4>faith,</mark4><br>
"Be thou removed!" it to the mountain <mark5>saith,</mark5><br>
And with ambitious feet, secure and <mark4>proud,</mark4><br>
Ascends the ladder leaning on the <mark3>cloud!</mark3><br>
<br>
As ancient Priam at the Scaean <mark4>gate</mark4><br>
Sat on the walls of Troy in regal <mark3>state</mark3><br>
With the old men, too old and weak to <mark4>fight,</mark4><br>
Chirping like grasshoppers in their <mark3>delight</mark3><br>
To see the embattled hosts, with spear and <mark4>shield,</mark4><br>
Of Trojans and Achaians in the <mark3>field;</mark3><br>
So from the snowy summits of our <mark4>years</mark4><br>
We see you in the plain, as each <mark3>appears,</mark3><br>
And question of you; asking, "Who is <mark3>he</mark3><br>
That towers above the others? Which may <mark3>be</mark3><br>
Atreides, Menelaus, <mark4>Odysseus,</mark4><br>
Ajax the great, or bold Idomeneus?" <br>
<br>
Let him not boast who puts his armor <mark4>on</mark4><br>
As he who puts it off, the battle <mark4>done.</mark4><br>
Study yourselves; and most of all note <mark3>well</mark3><br>
Wherein kind Nature meant you to <mark3>excel.</mark3><br>
Not every blossom ripens into <mark1>fruit;</mark1><br>
Minerva, the inventress of the <mark3>flute,</mark3><br>
Flung it <mark4>aside</mark4>, when she her face <mark4>surveyed</mark4><br>
Distorted in a fountain as she <mark3>played;</mark3><br>
The unlucky Marsyas found <mark4>it</mark4>, and his <mark4>fate</mark4><br>
Was one to make the bravest <mark4>hesitate.</mark4><br>
<br>
Write on your doors the saying wise and <mark4>old,</mark4><br>
"Be bold! be bold!" and everywhere, "Be <mark3>bold;</mark3><br>
Be not too bold!" Yet better the <mark4>excess</mark4><br>
Than the defect; better the more than <mark3>less;</mark3><br>
Better like Hector in the field to <mark1>die,</mark1><br>
Than like a perfumed Paris turn and <mark3>fly.</mark3><br>
<br>
And now, my classmates; ye remaining <mark3>few</mark3><br>
That number not the half of those we <mark3>knew,</mark3><br>
Ye, against whose familiar names not <mark4>yet</mark4><br>
The fatal asterisk of death is <mark3>set,</mark3><br>
Ye I salute! The horologe of <mark3>Time</mark3><br>
Strikes the half-century with a solemn <mark3>chime,</mark3><br>
And summons us together once <mark4>again,</mark4><br>
The joy of meeting not unmixed with <mark3>pain.</mark3><br>
<br>
Where are the others? Voices from the <mark3>deep</mark3><br>
Caverns of darkness answer me: "They <mark3>sleep!"</mark3><br>
I name no names; instinctively I <mark4>feel</mark4><br>
Each at some well-remembered grave will <mark3>kneel,</mark3><br>
And from the inscription wipe the weeds and <mark4>moss,</mark4><br>
For every heart best knoweth its own <mark3>loss.</mark3><br>
I see their scattered gravestones gleaming <mark4>white</mark4><br>
Through the pale dusk of the impending <mark3>night;</mark3><br>
O'er all alike the impartial sunset <mark4>throws</mark4><br>
Its golden lilies mingled with the <mark1>rose;</mark1><br>
We give to each a tender thought, and <mark4>pass</mark4><br>
Out of the graveyards with their tangled <mark3>grass,</mark3><br>
Unto these scenes frequented by our <mark4>feet</mark4><br>
When we were young, and life was fresh and <mark3>sweet.</mark3><br>
<br>
What shall I say to you? What can I <mark3>say</mark3><br>
Better than silence is? When I <mark3>survey</mark3><br>
This throng of faces turned to meet my <mark1>own,</mark1><br>
Friendly and fair, and yet to me <mark3>unknown,</mark3><br>
Transformed the very landscape seems to <mark1>be;</mark1><br>
It is the same, yet not the same to <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
So many memories crowd upon my <mark4>brain,</mark4><br>
So many ghosts are in the wooded <mark3>plain,</mark3><br>
I fain would steal away, with noiseless <mark4>tread,</mark4><br>
As from a house where some one lieth <mark1>dead.</mark1><br>
I cannot go;--I pause;--I <mark1>hesitate;</mark1><br>
My feet reluctant linger at the <mark1>gate;</mark1><br>
As one who struggles in a troubled <mark4>dream</mark4><br>
To speak and cannot, to myself I <mark3>seem.</mark3><br>
<br>
Vanish the dream! Vanish the idle <mark4>fears!</mark4><br>
Vanish the rolling mists of fifty <mark1>years!</mark1><br>
Whatever time or space may <mark4>intervene,</mark4><br>
I will not be a stranger in this <mark3>scene.</mark3><br>
Here every doubt, all indecision, <mark4>ends;</mark4><br>
Hail, my companions, comrades, classmates, <mark3>friends!</mark3><br>
<br>
Ah me! the fifty years since last we <mark4>met</mark4><br>
Seem to me fifty folios bound and <mark1>set</mark1><br>
By Time, the great transcriber, on his <mark4>shelves,</mark4><br>
Wherein are written the histories of <mark3>ourselves.</mark3><br>
What tragedies, what comedies, are <mark4>there;</mark4><br>
What joy and grief, what rapture and <mark3>despair!</mark3><br>
What chronicles of triumph and <mark4>defeat,</mark4><br>
Of struggle, and temptation, and <mark3>retreat!</mark3><br>
What records of regrets, and doubts, and <mark1>fears!</mark1><br>
What pages blotted, blistered by our <mark3>tears!</mark3><br>
What lovely landscapes on the margin <mark4>shine,</mark4><br>
What sweet, angelic faces, what <mark3>divine</mark3><br>
And holy images of love and <mark4>trust,</mark4><br>
Undimmed by age, unsoiled by damp or <mark3>dust!</mark3><br>
Whose hand shall dare to open and <mark4>explore</mark4><br>
These volumes, closed and clasped forevermore? <br>
Not mine. With reverential feet I <mark1>pass;</mark1><br>
I hear a voice that cries, "Alas! <mark3>alas!</mark3><br>
Whatever hath been written shall <mark4>remain,</mark4><br>
Nor be erased nor written o'er <mark1>again;</mark1><br>
The unwritten only still belongs to <mark3>thee:</mark3><br>
Take heed, and ponder well what that shall <mark1>be."</mark1><br>
<br>
As children frightened by a <mark4>thunder-cloud</mark4><br>
Are reassured if some one reads <mark3>aloud</mark3><br>
A tale of wonder, with enchantment <mark4>fraught,</mark4><br>
Or wild adventure, that diverts their <mark3>thought,</mark3><br>
Let me endeavor with a tale to <mark4>chase</mark4><br>
The gathering shadows of the time and <mark3>place,</mark3><br>
And banish what we all too deeply <mark1>feel</mark1><br>
Wholly to say, or wholly to <mark3>conceal.</mark3><br>
<br>
In mediaeval Rome, I know not <mark1>where,</mark1><br>
There stood an image with its arm in <mark3>air,</mark3><br>
And on its lifted finger, shining <mark4>clear,</mark4><br>
A golden ring with the device, "Strike <mark1>here!"</mark1><br>
Greatly the people wondered, though none <mark4>guessed</mark4><br>
The meaning that these words but half <mark3>expressed,</mark3><br>
Until a learned clerk, who at <mark5>noonday</mark5><br>
With downcast eyes was passing on his <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
Paused, and observed the spot, and marked it <mark1>well,</mark1><br>
Whereon the shadow of the finger <mark3>fell;</mark3><br>
And, coming back at midnight, <mark4>delved</mark4>, and <mark4>found</mark4><br>
A secret stairway leading <mark4>underground.</mark4><br>
Down this he passed into a spacious <mark4>hall,</mark4><br>
Lit by a flaming jewel on the <mark3>wall;</mark3><br>
And opposite, in threatening <mark4>attitude,</mark4><br>
With bow and shaft a brazen statue <mark4>stood.</mark4><br>
Upon its forehead, like a <mark4>coronet,</mark4><br>
Were these mysterious words of menace <mark1>set:</mark1><br>
"That which I am, I <mark4>am</mark4>, my fatal <mark4>aim</mark4><br>
None can escape, not even yon luminous <mark3>flame!"</mark3><br>
<br>
Midway the hall was a fair table <mark4>placed,</mark4><br>
With cloth of gold, and golden cups enchased <br>
With rubies, and the plates and knives were <mark4>gold,</mark4><br>
And gold the bread and viands <mark4>manifold.</mark4><br>
Around it, silent, motionless, and <mark4>sad,</mark4><br>
Were seated gallant knights in armor <mark3>clad,</mark3><br>
And ladies beautiful with plume and <mark4>zone,</mark4><br>
But they were <mark1>stone</mark1>, their hearts within were <mark3>stone;</mark3><br>
And the vast hall was filled in every <mark4>part</mark4><br>
With silent crowds, stony in face and <mark1>heart.</mark1><br>
<br>
Long at the scene, bewildered and <mark4>amazed</mark4><br>
The trembling clerk in speechless wonder <mark3>gazed;</mark3><br>
Then from the table, by his greed made <mark1>bold,</mark1><br>
He seized a goblet and a knife of <mark1>gold,</mark1><br>
And suddenly from their seats the guests upsprang, <br>
The vaulted ceiling with loud clamors rang, <br>
The archer sped his arrow, at their <mark3>call,</mark3><br>
Shattering the lambent jewel on the <mark1>wall,</mark1><br>
And all was dark around and <mark4>overhead;--</mark4><br>
Stark on the floor the luckless clerk lay <mark1>dead!</mark1><br>
<br>
The writer of this legend then <mark4>records</mark4><br>
Its ghostly application in these <mark4>words:</mark4><br>
The image is the Adversary <mark1>old,</mark1><br>
Whose beckoning finger points to realms of <mark1>gold;</mark1><br>
Our lusts and passions are the downward <mark4>stair</mark4><br>
That leads the soul from a diviner <mark1>air;</mark1><br>
The archer, Death; the flaming jewel, <mark3>Life;</mark3><br>
Terrestrial goods, the goblet and the <mark3>knife;</mark3><br>
The knights and ladies, all whose flesh and <mark3>bone</mark3><br>
By avarice have been hardened into <mark1>stone;</mark1><br>
The clerk, the scholar whom the love of pelf <br>
Tempts from his books and from his nobler <mark4>self.</mark4><br>
<br>
The scholar and the world! The endless <mark4>strife,</mark4><br>
The discord in the harmonies of <mark1>life!</mark1><br>
The love of learning, the sequestered <mark4>nooks,</mark4><br>
And all the sweet serenity of <mark3>books;</mark3><br>
The market-place, the eager love of <mark4>gain,</mark4><br>
Whose aim is vanity, and whose end is <mark1>pain!</mark1><br>
<br>
But why, you ask me, should this tale be <mark3>told</mark3><br>
To men grown <mark1>old</mark1>, or who are growing <mark1>old?</mark1><br>
It is too late! Ah, nothing is too <mark4>late</mark4><br>
Till the tired heart shall cease to <mark4>palpitate.</mark4><br>
Cato learned Greek at eighty; <mark4>Sophocles</mark4><br>
Wrote his grand Oedipus, and Simonides <br>
Bore off the prize of verse from his compeers, <br>
When each had numbered more than fourscore <mark1>years,</mark1><br>
And Theophrastus, at fourscore and <mark4>ten,</mark4><br>
Had but begun his "Characters of <mark3>Men."</mark3><br>
Chaucer, at Woodstock with the <mark5>nightingales,</mark5><br>
At sixty wrote the Canterbury <mark4>Tales;</mark4><br>
Goethe at Weimar, toiling to the <mark4>last,</mark4><br>
Completed Faust when eighty years were <mark1>past.</mark1><br>
These are indeed exceptions; but they <mark3>show</mark3><br>
How far the gulf-stream of our youth may <mark3>flow</mark3><br>
Into the arctic regions of our <mark4>lives,</mark4><br>
Where little else than life itself <mark3>survives.</mark3><br>
<br>
As the barometer foretells the <mark4>storm</mark4><br>
While still the skies are clear, the weather <mark3>warm</mark3><br>
So something in us, as old age draws <mark4>near,</mark4><br>
Betrays the pressure of the <mark4>atmosphere.</mark4><br>
The nimble mercury, ere we are <mark4>aware,</mark4><br>
Descends the elastic ladder of the <mark1>air;</mark1><br>
The telltale blood in artery and <mark4>vein</mark4><br>
Sinks from its higher levels in the <mark1>brain;</mark1><br>
Whatever poet, orator, or <mark3>sage</mark3><br>
May say of it, old age is still old <mark3>age.</mark3><br>
It is the waning, not the crescent <mark4>moon;</mark4><br>
The dusk of evening, not the blaze of <mark3>noon;</mark3><br>
It is not strength, but weakness; not <mark5>desire,</mark5><br>
But its surcease; not the fierce heat of <mark3>fire,</mark3><br>
The burning and consuming <mark4>element,</mark4><br>
But that of ashes and of embers <mark4>spent,</mark4><br>
In which some living sparks we still <mark4>discern,</mark4><br>
Enough to warm, but not enough to <mark3>burn.</mark3><br>
<br>
What then? Shall we sit idly down and <mark1>say</mark1><br>
The night hath come; it is no longer <mark3>day?</mark3><br>
The night hath not yet come; we are not <mark4>quite</mark4><br>
Cut off from labor by the failing <mark3>light;</mark3><br>
Something remains for us to do or <mark4>dare;</mark4><br>
Even the oldest tree some fruit may <mark3>bear;</mark3><br>
Not Oedipus Coloneus, or Greek <mark4>Ode,</mark4><br>
Or tales of pilgrims that one morning <mark3>rode</mark3><br>
Out of the gateway of the Tabard <mark4>Inn,</mark4><br>
But other something, would we but <mark3>begin;</mark3><br>
For age is opportunity no <mark1>less</mark1><br>
Than youth itself, though in another <mark3>dress,</mark3><br>
And as the evening twilight fades <mark3>away</mark3><br>
The sky is filled with stars, invisible by <mark1>day.</mark1><br>
