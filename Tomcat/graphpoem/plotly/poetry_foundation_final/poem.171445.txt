Title : The Metaphysical Amorist <br>
Author : J. V. Cunningham <br><br>

You are the problem I <mark4>propose,</mark4><br>
My dear, the text my musings glose: <br>
I call you for convenience <mark3>love.</mark3><br>
By definition you're a <mark4>cause</mark4><br>
Inferred by necessary <mark3>laws--</mark3><br>
You are so to the saints <mark3>above.</mark3><br>
But in this shadowy lower <mark3>life</mark3><br>
I sleep with a terrestrial <mark3>wife</mark3><br>
And earthy children I <mark3>beget.</mark3><br>
Love is a fiction I must <mark4>use,</mark4><br>
A privilege I can <mark3>abuse,</mark3><br>
And sometimes something I <mark3>forget.</mark3><br>
<br>
Now, in the heavenly other <mark4>place</mark4><br>
Love is in the eternal <mark3>mind</mark3><br>
The luminous form whose shade she <mark4>is,</mark4><br>
A ghost discarnate, thought <mark3>defined.</mark3><br>
She was so to my early <mark4>bliss,</mark4><br>
She is so while I <mark4>comprehend</mark4><br>
The forms my senses <mark3>apprehend,</mark3><br>
And in the end she will be <mark3>so.</mark3><br>
<br>
Her whom my hands embrace I <mark3>kiss,</mark3><br>
Her whom my mind infers I <mark3>know.</mark3><br>
The one exists in time and <mark4>space</mark4><br>
And as she was she will not <mark4>be;</mark4><br>
The other is in her own <mark3>grace</mark3><br>
And is She is <mark4>eternally.</mark4><br>
<br>
Plato! you shall not plague my <mark1>life.</mark1><br>
I married a terrestrial <mark1>wife.</mark1><br>
And Hume! she is not mere <mark3>sensation</mark3><br>
In sequence of observed <mark3>relation.</mark3><br>
She has two forms--ah, thank you, <mark4>Duns!--,</mark4><br>
I know her in both ways at <mark4>once.</mark4><br>
I knew her, yes, before I knew <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
And by both means I must construe <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
And none among you shall undo <mark1>her.</mark1><br>
