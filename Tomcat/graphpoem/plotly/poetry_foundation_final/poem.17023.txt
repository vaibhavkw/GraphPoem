Title : The Annihilation of Nothing <br>
Author : Thom Gunn <br><br>

Nothing remained: Nothing, the wanton <mark4>name</mark4><br>
That nightly I rehearsed till led <mark3>away</mark3><br>
To a dark sleep, or sleep that held one <mark4>dream.</mark4><br>
<br>
In this a huge contagious absence <mark3>lay,</mark3><br>
More space than space, over the cloud and <mark4>slime,</mark4><br>
Defined but by the encroachments of its <mark3>sway.</mark3><br>
<br>
Stripped to indifference at the turns of <mark3>time,</mark3><br>
Whose end I knew, I woke without <mark3>desire,</mark3><br>
And welcomed zero as a <mark4>paradigm.</mark4><br>
<br>
But now it breaks--images burst with <mark3>fire</mark3><br>
Into the quiet sphere where I have bided,<br>
Showing the landscape holding yet <mark3>entire:</mark3><br>
<br>
The power that I <mark4>envisaged</mark4>, that <mark4>presided</mark4><br>
Ultimate in its abstract devastations,<br>
Is merely change, the atoms it <mark3>divided</mark3><br>
<br>
Complete, in ignorance, new <mark3>combinations.</mark3><br>
Only an infinite finitude I <mark3>see</mark3><br>
In those peculiar lovely <mark3>variations.</mark3><br>
<br>
It is despair that nothing cannot <mark3>be</mark3><br>
Flares in the mind and leaves a smoky <mark3>mark</mark3><br>
Of <mark4>dread.</mark4><br>
Look upward. Neither firm nor <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
<br>
Purposeless matter hovers in the <mark3>dark.</mark3><br>
