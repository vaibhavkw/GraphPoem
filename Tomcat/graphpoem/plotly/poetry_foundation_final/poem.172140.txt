Title : The Vegetable Air <br>
Author : Cathy Song <br><br>

You're clean shaven in this <mark4>country</mark4><br>
where trees grow beards of <mark4>moss,</mark4><br>
where even bank <mark4>tellers</mark4><br>
look a little like banditos <br>
in vests as pungent as sweatsuits.   <br>
Still, you prefer the vegetable <mark4>air</mark4><br>
to almost any other place on the <mark4>map.</mark4><br>
After the heart <mark4>attack,</mark4><br>
you considered <mark4>Paris--</mark4><br>
the flying <mark4>buttresses,</mark4><br>
the fractured light of its <mark4>cathedrals;</mark4><br>
the entire city refined and <mark4>otherworldly,</mark4><br>
ascending on its architectural <mark4>wings--</mark4><br>
but decided you had no use for <mark4>glory,</mark4><br>
boulevards <mark4>fur-lined</mark4><br>
with statues and expensive <mark4>trees.</mark4><br>
<br>
You admit, on the <mark4>whole,</mark4><br>
the towns in this country are <mark4>ugly.</mark4><br>
One summer you drove toward Nicoya <br>
(a beautiful name that became your <mark4>destination),</mark4><br>
expecting a fragrant town of mango <mark1>trees</mark1><br>
but found cattle grazing in the <mark5>plaza,</mark5><br>
rattling the tin <mark4>plates</mark4><br>
in the ubiquitous Chinese <mark4>restaurant.</mark4><br>
A Coca-Cola sign hung weathered and askew.   <br>
That's perhaps why you like <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
it's a country you can't count <mark4>on,</mark4><br>
a country of <mark4>misfits.</mark4><br>
Unable to take root in the <mark4>mud,</mark4><br>
the twentieth century has failed <mark4>miserably,</mark4><br>
creating neither factory nor <mark4>industry</mark4><br>
but a thirst for soda <mark4>pop;</mark4><br>
like cosmetic <mark4>surgery,</mark4><br>
it is skin <mark4>deep.</mark4><br>
The clock is stuck in the <mark4>rain</mark4><br>
and the mud of four <mark4>o'clock.</mark4><br>
There's nothing to do but wait as <mark4>if</mark4><br>
in a dry cave, a room with a view of the <mark4>waterfall,</mark4><br>
pinned as you are beneath the <mark4>downpour.</mark4><br>
The waiter bends over your <mark4>cup</mark4><br>
without filling <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
the storekeeper holds your <mark1>change</mark1><br>
until the rain, hypnotic and <mark4>dramatic,</mark4><br>
leaves the streets and the <mark4>gutters,</mark4><br>
the balcony and the air <mark4>greener</mark4>, <mark4>heavier--</mark4><br>
mildew blooming in the closet where your <mark4>shoes,</mark4><br>
powdered with a sea-green <mark4>lichen,</mark4><br>
resembles old <mark4>bronze,</mark4><br>
a pair of ancient goblets. <br>
<br>
While iguanas lounge in the <mark3>attic</mark3><br>
(a prehistoric version of the domestic <mark4>rat),</mark4><br>
the Office of the <mark4>Ministry</mark4><br>
(a pink and crumbling <mark4>building</mark4><br>
surrounded by dusty rose <mark1>trees)</mark1><br>
prints more money to <mark4>prop</mark4><br>
the flimsy flowered <mark4>currency.</mark4><br>
You can't predict what your <mark4>American</mark4><br>
dollars will bring by <mark4>morning.</mark4><br>
In the hotel <mark1>restaurant</mark1><br>
you meet the Undesirable <mark1>American.</mark1><br>
He learns just enough of the local lingo <br>
to swing by, living on a dwindling <mark4>account</mark4><br>
and, here and there, a real estate <mark4>swindle.</mark4><br>
Or the pensionado who buys two <mark4>cigars,</mark4><br>
offering you one the day <br>
his Social Security <mark4>arrives.</mark4><br>
Like the cockroach, the <mark4>displaced</mark4><br>
have crawled through the <mark4>cracks</mark4><br>
and selected for <mark4>themselves</mark4><br>
an agreeable <mark4>niche.</mark4><br>
A place to start from <mark4>scratch.</mark4><br>
They thrive in the vegetable <mark1>air.</mark1><br>
You wonder how you'll <mark5>survive,</mark5><br>
unfit, unable to <mark4>work.</mark4><br>
Lacking the predatory <mark4>skills,</mark4><br>
you've stayed in the <mark1>trees,</mark1><br>
a dreamer, all your <mark4>life,</mark4><br>
even now wanting to <mark4>believe</mark4><br>
a change of <mark4>scenery</mark4><br>
will get you back on your <mark4>feet.</mark4><br>
A brief hiatus in the vegetable <mark1>air.</mark1><br>
<br>
Tonight, you walk along the damp <mark4>streets,</mark4><br>
an average steak, a glass of <mark4>wine</mark4><br>
swishing in your <mark4>belly,</mark4><br>
to your small room wedged <mark4>between</mark4><br>
a jukebox and a dance <mark4>hall.</mark4><br>
There are so many things you can't <mark1>change--</mark1><br>
like the dull thrashing <mark4>music.</mark4><br>
You draw the blinds, switch on the tiny <mark4>cassette.</mark4><br>
Silence. The click of the <mark4>tape.</mark4><br>
And then the familiar <mark4>aria,</mark4><br>
rising like the <mark4>moon,</mark4><br>
lifts you out of <mark4>yourself,</mark4><br>
transporting you to another <mark1>country</mark1><br>
where, for a <mark4>moment</mark4>, you travel <mark4>light.</mark4><br>
