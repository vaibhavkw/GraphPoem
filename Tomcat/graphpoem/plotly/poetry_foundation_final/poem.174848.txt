Title : I Find no Peace <br>
Author : Sir Thomas Wyatt <br><br>

I find no peace, and all my war is <mark4>done.</mark4><br>
I fear and hope. I burn and freeze like <mark3>ice.</mark3><br>
I fly above the wind, yet can I not <mark3>arise;</mark3><br>
And nought I have, and all the world I <mark4>season.</mark4><br>
That loseth nor locketh holdeth me in <mark4>prison</mark4><br>
And holdeth me not--yet can I scape no <mark3>wise--</mark3><br>
Nor letteth me live nor die at my <mark3>device,</mark3><br>
And yet of death it giveth me <mark4>occasion.</mark4><br>
Without eyen I see, and without tongue I <mark4>plain.</mark4><br>
I desire to perish, and yet I ask <mark4>health.</mark4><br>
I love another, and thus I hate <mark4>myself.</mark4><br>
I feed me in sorrow and laugh in all my <mark3>pain;</mark3><br>
Likewise displeaseth me both life and <mark4>death,</mark4><br>
And my delight is causer of this <mark4>strife.</mark4><br>
