Grow old along with <mark3>me!</mark3><br>
The best is yet to <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
The last of life, for which the first was <mark4>made:</mark4><br>
Our times are in His <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
Who saith "A whole I <mark3>planned,</mark3><br>
Youth shows but half; trust God: see all, nor be <mark4>afraid!''</mark4><br>
<br>
Not that, amassing <mark3>flowers,</mark3><br>
Youth sighed "Which rose make <mark3>ours,</mark3><br>
Which lily leave and then as best <mark3>recall?"</mark3><br>
Not that, admiring <mark3>stars,</mark3><br>
It yearned "Nor Jove, nor <mark3>Mars;</mark3><br>
Mine be some figured flame which blends, transcends them <mark3>all!"</mark3><br>
<br>
Not for such hopes and <mark4>fears</mark4><br>
Annulling youth's brief <mark3>years,</mark3><br>
Do I remonstrate: folly wide the <mark3>mark!</mark3><br>
Rather I prize the <mark3>doubt</mark3><br>
Low kinds exist <mark3>without,</mark3><br>
Finished and finite clods, untroubled by a <mark3>spark.</mark3><br>
<br>
Poor vaunt of life <mark4>indeed,</mark4><br>
Were man but formed to <mark3>feed</mark3><br>
On joy, to solely seek and find and <mark4>feast:</mark4><br>
Such feasting ended, <mark3>then</mark3><br>
As sure an end to <mark3>men;</mark3><br>
Irks care the crop-full bird? Frets doubt the maw-crammed <mark3>beast?</mark3><br>
<br>
Rejoice we are <mark4>allied</mark4><br>
To That which doth <mark3>provide</mark3><br>
And not partake, effect and not <mark5>receive!</mark5><br>
A spark disturbs our clod; <br>
Nearer we hold of <mark4>God</mark4><br>
Who gives, than of His tribes that take, I must <mark3>believe.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then, welcome each <mark3>rebuff</mark3><br>
That turns earth's smoothness <mark3>rough,</mark3><br>
Each sting that bids nor sit nor stand but <mark3>go!</mark3><br>
Be our joys three-parts <mark4>pain!</mark4><br>
Strive, and hold cheap the <mark3>strain;</mark3><br>
Learn, nor account the pang; dare, never grudge the throe! <br>
<br>
For thence,--a <mark4>paradox</mark4><br>
Which comforts while it <mark4>mocks,--</mark4><br>
Shall life succeed in that it seems to <mark4>fail:</mark4><br>
What I aspired to <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
And was not, comforts <mark1>me:</mark1><br>
A brute I might have been, but would not sink i' the <mark3>scale.</mark3><br>
<br>
What is he but a <mark4>brute</mark4><br>
Whose flesh has soul to <mark3>suit,</mark3><br>
Whose spirit works lest arms and legs want <mark5>play?</mark5><br>
To man, propose this <mark4>test--</mark4><br>
Thy body at its <mark3>best,</mark3><br>
How far can that project thy soul on its lone <mark3>way?</mark3><br>
<br>
Yet gifts should prove their <mark4>use:</mark4><br>
I own the Past <mark3>profuse</mark3><br>
Of power each side, perfection every <mark4>turn:</mark4><br>
Eyes, ears took in their <mark4>dole,</mark4><br>
Brain treasured up the <mark3>whole;</mark3><br>
Should not the heart beat once "How good to live and <mark3>learn?"</mark3><br>
<br>
Not once beat "Praise be <mark4>Thine!</mark4><br>
I see the whole <mark3>design,</mark3><br>
I, who saw power, see now love perfect <mark3>too:</mark3><br>
Perfect I call Thy <mark4>plan:</mark4><br>
Thanks that I was a <mark3>man!</mark3><br>
Maker, remake, complete,--I trust what Thou shalt <mark3>do!"</mark3><br>
<br>
For pleasant is this <mark3>flesh;</mark3><br>
Our soul, in its <mark3>rose-mesh</mark3><br>
Pulled ever to the earth, still yearns for <mark3>rest;</mark3><br>
Would we some prize might <mark4>hold</mark4><br>
To match those <mark4>manifold</mark4><br>
Possessions of the brute,--gain <mark4>most</mark4>, as we did <mark1>best!</mark1><br>
<br>
Let us not always <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
"Spite of this flesh <mark3>to-day</mark3><br>
I strove, made head, gained ground upon the <mark1>whole!"</mark1><br>
As the bird wings and <mark4>sings,</mark4><br>
Let us cry "All good <mark3>things</mark3><br>
Are ours, nor soul helps flesh more, now, than flesh helps <mark3>soul!"</mark3><br>
<br>
Therefore I summon <mark4>age</mark4><br>
To grant youth's <mark4>heritage,</mark4><br>
Life's struggle having so far reached its <mark3>term:</mark3><br>
Thence shall I pass, <mark4>approved</mark4><br>
A man, for aye <mark3>removed</mark3><br>
From the developed brute; a god though in the <mark3>germ.</mark3><br>
<br>
And I shall <mark4>thereupon</mark4><br>
Take rest, ere I be <mark4>gone</mark4><br>
Once more on my adventure brave and <mark3>new:</mark3><br>
Fearless and unperplexed, <br>
When I wage battle <mark4>next,</mark4><br>
What weapons to select, what armour to <mark5>indue.</mark5><br>
<br>
Youth ended, I shall <mark3>try</mark3><br>
My gain or loss <mark3>thereby;</mark3><br>
Leave the fire ashes, what survives is <mark4>gold:</mark4><br>
And I shall weigh the <mark4>same,</mark4><br>
Give life its praise or <mark3>blame:</mark3><br>
Young, all lay in dispute; I shall know, being <mark3>old.</mark3><br>
<br>
For note, when evening <mark4>shuts,</mark4><br>
A certain moment <mark3>cuts</mark3><br>
The deed off, calls the glory from the <mark3>grey:</mark3><br>
A whisper from the <mark3>west</mark3><br>
Shoots--"Add this to the <mark1>rest,</mark1><br>
Take it and try its worth: here dies another <mark3>day."</mark3><br>
<br>
So, still within this <mark4>life,</mark4><br>
Though lifted o'er its <mark3>strife,</mark3><br>
Let me discern, compare, pronounce at <mark4>last,</mark4><br>
This rage was right i' the <mark4>main,</mark4><br>
That acquiescence <mark3>vain:</mark3><br>
The Future I may face now I have proved the <mark3>Past."</mark3><br>
<br>
For more is not <mark4>reserved</mark4><br>
To man, with soul just nerved <br>
To act to-morrow what he learns <mark1>to-day:</mark1><br>
Here, work enough to <mark4>watch</mark4><br>
The Master work, and <mark4>catch</mark4><br>
Hints of the proper craft, tricks of the tool's true <mark1>play.</mark1><br>
<br>
As it was better, <mark3>youth</mark3><br>
Should strive, through acts <mark3>uncouth,</mark3><br>
Toward making, than repose on aught found <mark1>made:</mark1><br>
So, better, age, <mark4>exempt</mark4><br>
From strife, should know, than <mark3>tempt</mark3><br>
Further. Thou waitedst age: wait death nor be <mark1>afraid!</mark1><br>
<br>
Enough now, if the <mark4>Right</mark4><br>
And Good and <mark4>Infinite</mark4><br>
Be named here, as thou callest thy hand thine <mark4>own</mark4><br>
With knowledge <mark4>absolute,</mark4><br>
Subject to no <mark4>dispute</mark4><br>
From fools that crowded youth, nor let thee feel <mark3>alone.</mark3><br>
<br>
Be there, for once and <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
Severed great minds from <mark3>small,</mark3><br>
Announced to each his station in the <mark1>Past!</mark1><br>
Was I, the world <mark4>arraigned,</mark4><br>
Were they, my soul <mark3>disdained,</mark3><br>
Right? Let age speak the truth and give us peace at <mark1>last!</mark1><br>
<br>
Now, who shall <mark4>arbitrate?</mark4><br>
Ten men love what I <mark4>hate,</mark4><br>
Shun what I follow, slight what I <mark1>receive;</mark1><br>
Ten, who in ears and <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
Match me: we all <mark3>surmise,</mark3><br>
They this thing, and I that: whom shall my soul <mark1>believe?</mark1><br>
<br>
Not on the vulgar <mark4>mass</mark4><br>
Called "work," must sentence <mark3>pass,</mark3><br>
Things done, that took the eye and had the <mark4>price;</mark4><br>
O'er which, from level <mark4>stand,</mark4><br>
The low world laid its <mark1>hand,</mark1><br>
Found straightway to its mind, could value in a <mark3>trice:</mark3><br>
<br>
But all, the world's coarse <mark4>thumb</mark4><br>
And finger failed to <mark3>plumb,</mark3><br>
So passed in making up the main <mark4>account;</mark4><br>
All instincts <mark3>immature,</mark3><br>
All purposes <mark3>unsure,</mark3><br>
That weighed not as his work, yet swelled the man's <mark3>amount:</mark3><br>
<br>
Thoughts hardly to be <mark4>packed</mark4><br>
Into a narrow <mark3>act,</mark3><br>
Fancies that broke through language and <mark4>escaped;</mark4><br>
All I could never <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
All, men ignored in <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
This, I was worth to God, whose wheel the pitcher <mark3>shaped.</mark3><br>
<br>
Ay, note that Potter's <mark4>wheel,</mark4><br>
That metaphor! and <mark3>feel</mark3><br>
Why time spins fast, why passive lies our <mark3>clay,--</mark3><br>
Thou, to whom fools <mark4>propound,</mark4><br>
When the wine makes its <mark3>round,</mark3><br>
"Since life fleets, all is change; the Past gone, seize <mark1>to-day!"</mark1><br>
<br>
Fool! All that is, at <mark1>all,</mark1><br>
Lasts ever, past <mark1>recall;</mark1><br>
Earth changes, but thy soul and God stand <mark3>sure:</mark3><br>
What entered into <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
That was, is, and shall <mark1>be:</mark1><br>
Time's wheel runs back or stops: Potter and clay <mark3>endure.</mark3><br>
<br>
He fixed thee mid this <mark4>dance</mark4><br>
Of plastic <mark4>circumstance,</mark4><br>
This Present, thou, forsooth, wouldst fain <mark4>arrest:</mark4><br>
Machinery just <mark4>meant</mark4><br>
To give thy soul its <mark3>bent,</mark3><br>
Try thee and turn thee forth, sufficiently <mark4>impressed.</mark4><br>
<br>
What though the earlier <mark4>grooves,</mark4><br>
Which ran the laughing <mark4>loves</mark4><br>
Around thy <mark4>base</mark4>, no longer pause and <mark4>press?</mark4><br>
What though, about thy <mark4>rim,</mark4><br>
Skull-things in order <mark3>grim</mark3><br>
Grow out, in graver mood, obey the sterner <mark3>stress?</mark3><br>
<br>
Look not thou down but <mark3>up!</mark3><br>
To uses of a <mark3>cup,</mark3><br>
The festal board, lamp's flash and trumpet's <mark4>peal,</mark4><br>
The new wine's foaming <mark3>flow,</mark3><br>
The Master's lips <mark3>a-glow!</mark3><br>
Thou, heaven's consummate cup, what need'st thou with earth's <mark1>wheel?</mark1><br>
<br>
But I need, now as <mark1>then,</mark1><br>
Thee, God, who mouldest <mark1>men;</mark1><br>
And since, not even while the whirl was <mark4>worst,</mark4><br>
Did I,--to the wheel of <mark1>life</mark1><br>
With shapes and colours <mark3>rife,</mark3><br>
Bound dizzily,--mistake my end, to slake Thy <mark3>thirst:</mark3><br>
<br>
So, take and use Thy <mark4>work:</mark4><br>
Amend what flaws may <mark3>lurk,</mark3><br>
What strain o' the stuff, what warpings past the <mark4>aim!</mark4><br>
My times be in Thy <mark1>hand!</mark1><br>
Perfect the cup as <mark1>planned!</mark1><br>
Let age approve of youth, and death complete the <mark1>same!</mark1><br>
