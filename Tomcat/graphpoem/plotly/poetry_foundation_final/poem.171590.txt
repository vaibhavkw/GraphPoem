Title : In Goya's Greatest Scenes We Seem to See . . . <br>
Author : Lawrence Ferlinghetti <br><br>

In Goya's greatest scenes we seem to see <br>
the people of the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
       exactly at the moment when <br>
             they first attained the title of <br>
'suffering <mark4>humanity'</mark4><br>
They writhe upon the <mark3>page</mark3><br>
in a veritable <mark3>rage</mark3><br>
                                                                of adversity   <br>
          Heaped up <br>
groaning with babies and <mark4>bayonets</mark4><br>
under cement <mark4>skies</mark4><br>
in an abstract landscape of blasted <mark4>trees</mark4><br>
                  bent statues bats wings and beaks <br>
                               slippery gibbets <br>
cadavers and carnivorous <mark4>cocks</mark4><br>
and all the final hollering <mark4>monsters</mark4><br>
of <mark4>the</mark4><br>
                           'imagination of disaster' <br>
they are so bloody <mark4>real</mark4><br>
it is as if they really still <mark4>existed</mark4><br>
<br>
    And they do <br>
<br>
Only the landscape is <mark4>changed</mark4><br>
<br>
They still are ranged along the <mark4>roads</mark4><br>
plagued by <mark4>legionnaires</mark4><br>
false windmills and demented <mark4>roosters</mark4><br>
They are the same <mark4>people</mark4><br>
                                     only further from home <br>
on freeways fifty lanes <mark4>wide</mark4><br>
                              on a concrete continent <br>
spaced with bland <mark4>billboards</mark4><br>
illustrating imbecile illusions of <mark4>happiness</mark4><br>
<br>
                        The scene shows fewer tumbrils <br>
but more strung-out <mark4>citizens</mark4><br>
in painted <mark4>cars</mark4><br>
and they have strange license <mark4>plates</mark4><br>
and <mark4>engines</mark4><br>
that devour <mark4>America</mark4><br>
