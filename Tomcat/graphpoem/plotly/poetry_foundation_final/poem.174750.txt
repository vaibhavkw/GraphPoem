Title : An Autograph <br>
Author : John Greenleaf Whittier <br><br>

I write my name as <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
On sands by waves <mark4>o'errun</mark4><br>
Or winter's frosted <mark4>pane,</mark4><br>
Traces a record <mark3>vain.</mark3><br>
<br>
Oblivion's blankness <mark4>claims</mark4><br>
Wiser and better <mark3>names,</mark3><br>
And well my own may <mark3>pass</mark3><br>
As from the strand or <mark3>glass.</mark3><br>
<br>
Wash on, O waves of <mark4>time!</mark4><br>
Melt, noons, the frosty rime! <br>
Welcome the shadow <mark3>vast,</mark3><br>
The silence that shall <mark3>last!</mark3><br>
<br>
When I and all who <mark3>know</mark3><br>
And love me vanish <mark3>so,</mark3><br>
What harm to them or <mark3>me</mark3><br>
Will the lost memory <mark3>be?</mark3><br>
<br>
If any words of <mark4>mine,</mark4><br>
Through right of life <mark3>divine,</mark3><br>
Remain, what matters <mark4>it</mark4><br>
Whose hand the message <mark3>writ?</mark3><br>
<br>
Why should the "crowner's <mark4>quest"</mark4><br>
Sit on my worst or <mark3>best?</mark3><br>
Why should the showman <mark4>claim</mark4><br>
The poor ghost of my <mark3>name?</mark3><br>
<br>
Yet, as when dies a <mark3>sound</mark3><br>
Its spectre lingers <mark3>round,</mark3><br>
Haply my spent life <mark3>will</mark3><br>
Leave some faint echo <mark3>still.</mark3><br>
<br>
A whisper giving <mark3>breath</mark3><br>
Of praise or blame to <mark3>death,</mark3><br>
Soothing or saddening <mark3>such</mark3><br>
As loved the living <mark3>much.</mark3><br>
<br>
Therefore with yearnings <mark1>vain</mark1><br>
And fond I still would <mark3>fain</mark3><br>
A kindly judgment <mark3>seek,</mark3><br>
A tender thought <mark3>bespeak.</mark3><br>
<br>
<mark4>And</mark4>, while my words are <mark4>read,</mark4><br>
Let this at least be <mark3>said:</mark3><br>
"Whate'er his life's defeatures, <br>
He loved his <mark4>fellow-creatures.</mark4><br>
<br>
"If, of the Law's stone <mark4>table,</mark4><br>
To hold he scarce was <mark3>able</mark3><br>
The first great precept <mark4>fast,</mark4><br>
He kept for man the <mark1>last.</mark1><br>
<br>
"Through mortal lapse and dulness <br>
What lacks the Eternal Fulness, <br>
If still our weakness <mark4>can</mark4><br>
Love Him in loving <mark3>man?</mark3><br>
<br>
"Age brought him no <mark4>despairing</mark4><br>
Of the world's future <mark4>faring;</mark4><br>
In human nature <mark1>still</mark1><br>
He found more good than <mark3>ill.</mark3><br>
<br>
"To all who dumbly <mark4>suffered,</mark4><br>
His tongue and pen he <mark4>offered;</mark4><br>
His life was not his <mark4>own,</mark4><br>
Nor lived for self <mark3>alone.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Hater of din and <mark4>riot</mark4><br>
He lived in days unquiet; <br>
And, lover of all <mark4>beauty,</mark4><br>
Trod the hard ways of <mark3>duty.</mark3><br>
<br>
"He meant no wrong to <mark4>any</mark4><br>
He sought the good of <mark3>many,</mark3><br>
Yet knew both sin and <mark4>folly,--</mark4><br>
May God forgive him <mark4>wholly!"</mark4><br>
