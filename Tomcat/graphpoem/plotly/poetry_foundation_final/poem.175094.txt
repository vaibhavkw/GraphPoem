Title : Greenland's Icy Mountains <br>
Author : Knight of the White Elephant of Burmah William McGonagall <br><br>

Greenland's icy mountains are fascinating and <mark3>grand,</mark3><br>
And wondrously created by the Almighty's <mark3>command;</mark3><br>
And the works of the Almighty there's few can <mark3>understand:</mark3><br>
Who knows but it might be a part of <mark4>Fairyland?</mark4><br>
<br>
Because there are churches of <mark4>ice</mark4>, and houses glittering like <mark4>glass,</mark4><br>
And for scenic grandeur there's nothing can it <mark3>surpass,</mark3><br>
Besides there's monuments and <mark4>spires</mark4>, also <mark4>ruins,</mark4><br>
Which serve for a safe retreat from the wild <mark3>bruins.</mark3><br>
<br>
And there's icy crags and precipices, also beautiful <mark4>waterfalls,</mark4><br>
And as the stranger gazes thereon, his heart it appals<br>
With a mixture of wonder, fear, and <mark3>delight,</mark3><br>
Till at last he exclaims, Oh! what a wonderful <mark3>sight!</mark3><br>
<br>
The icy mountains they're higher than a brig's topmast,<br>
And the stranger in amazement stands <mark4>aghast</mark4><br>
As he beholds the water flowing off the melted <mark4>ice</mark4><br>
Adown the mountain sides, that he cries out, Oh! how <mark3>nice!</mark3><br>
<br>
Such sights as these are truly magnificent to be <mark3>seen,</mark3><br>
Only that the mountain tops are white instead of <mark3>green,</mark3><br>
And rents and caverns in them, the same as on a rugged mountain <mark4>side,</mark4><br>
And suitable places, in my opinion, for mermaids to <mark3>reside.</mark3><br>
<br>
Sometimes these icy mountains suddenly topple <mark4>o'er</mark4><br>
With a wild and rumbling hollow-starting roar;<br>
And new peaks and cliffs rise up out of the sea,<br>
While great cataracts of uplifted brine pour down furiously.<br>
<br>
And those that can witness such an awful <mark1>sight</mark1><br>
Can only gaze thereon in solemn silence and <mark1>delight,</mark1><br>
And the most Godfearless man that hath this region <mark4>trod</mark4><br>
Would be forced to recognise the power and majesty of <mark3>God.</mark3><br>
<br>
Oh! how awful and grand it must be on a sunshiny <mark3>day</mark3><br>
To see one of these icy mountains in pieces give <mark3>way!</mark3><br>
While, crack after crack, it falls with a mighty <mark3>crash</mark3><br>
Flat upon the sea with a fearful <mark3>splash.</mark3><br>
<br>
And in the breaking up of these mountains they roar like <mark3>thunder,</mark3><br>
Which causes the stranger no doubt to <mark3>wonder;</mark3><br>
Also the Esquimaux of Greenland betimes will <mark4>stand</mark4><br>
And gaze on the wondrous work of the Almighty so <mark1>grand.</mark1><br>
<br>
When these icy mountains are falling, the report is like big <mark4>guns,</mark4><br>
And the glittering brilliancy of them causes <mark3>mock-suns,</mark3><br>
And around them there's connected a beautiful ring of <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
And as the stranger looks thereon, it fills his heart with <mark1>delight.</mark1><br>
<br>
Oh! think on the danger of seafaring <mark4>men</mark4><br>
If any of these mighty mountains where falling on them;<br>
Alas! they would be killed ere the hand of man could them <mark3>save</mark3><br>
And, poor creatures, very likely find a watery <mark3>grave!</mark3><br>
<br>
'Tis most beautiful to see and hear the whales whistling and <mark3>blowing,</mark3><br>
And the sailors in their small boats quickly after them <mark3>rowing,</mark3><br>
While the whales keep lashing the water all their <mark3>might</mark3><br>
With their mighty tails, left and <mark3>right.</mark3><br>
<br>
In winter there's no sunlight there night or <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
Which, no doubt, will cause the time to pass tediously <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
And cause the Esquimaux to long for the light of <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
So as they will get basking themselves in the sun's bright <mark3>array.</mark3><br>
<br>
In summer there is perpetual <mark4>sunlight,</mark4><br>
Which fill the Esquimaux's hearts with <mark1>delight;</mark1><br>
And is seen every day and night in the blue <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
Which makes the scenery appear most beautiful to the <mark3>eye.</mark3><br>
<br>
During summer and winter there the land is covered with <mark3>snow,</mark3><br>
Which sometimes must fill the Esquimaux' hearts with <mark3>woe</mark3><br>
As they traverse fields of ice, ten or fifteen feet <mark3>thick,</mark3><br>
And with cold, no doubt, their hearts will be touched to the <mark3>quick.</mark3><br>
<br>
And let those that read or hear this feel thankful to <mark1>God</mark1><br>
That the icy fields of Greenland they have never <mark1>trod;</mark1><br>
Especially while seated around the fireside on a cold winter <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
Let them think of the cold and hardships Greenland sailors have to <mark3>fight.</mark3><br>
