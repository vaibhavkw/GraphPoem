Title : Farewell to Bath <br>
Author : Lady Mary Wortley Montagu <br><br>

To all you ladies now at Bath,<br>
And eke, ye beaux, to <mark3>you,</mark3><br>
With aching heart, and wat'ry <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
I bid my last <mark3>adieu.</mark3><br>
<br>
Farewell ye nymphs, who waters <mark4>sip</mark4><br>
Hot reeking from the <mark3>pumps,</mark3><br>
While music lends her friendly <mark4>aid,</mark4><br>
To cheer you from the <mark3>dumps.</mark3><br>
<br>
Farewell ye wits, who prating <mark4>stand,</mark4><br>
And criticise the <mark3>fair;</mark3><br>
Yourselves the joke of men of <mark4>sense,</mark4><br>
Who hate a coxcomb's <mark3>air.</mark3><br>
<br>
Farewell to Deard's, and all her <mark4>toys,</mark4><br>
Which glitter in her <mark4>shop,</mark4><br>
Deluding traps to girls and <mark3>boys,</mark3><br>
The warehouse of the <mark4>fop.</mark4><br>
<br>
Lindsay's and Hayes's both <mark4>farewell,</mark4><br>
Where in the spacious <mark4>hall,</mark4><br>
With bounding steps, and sprightly <mark1>air,</mark1><br>
I've led up many a <mark3>ball.</mark3><br>
<br>
   Where Somerville of courteous mien,<br>
Was partner in the <mark4>dance,</mark4><br>
With swimming Haws, and Brownlow blithe,<br>
And Britton pink of <mark3>France.</mark3><br>
<br>
Poor Nash, farewell! may fortune <mark4>smile,</mark4><br>
Thy drooping soul <mark3>revive,</mark3><br>
My heart is full I can no <mark4>more?</mark4><br>
John, bid the coachman <mark3>drive.</mark3><br>
