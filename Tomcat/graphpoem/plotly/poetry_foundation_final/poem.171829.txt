Title : The Strange People <br>
Author : Louise Erdrich <br><br>

The antelope are strange people ... they are beautiful to look at, and yet they are tricky. We do not trust them. They appear and disappear; they are like shadows on the plains. Because of their great beauty, young men sometimes follow the antelope and are lost forever. Even if those foolish ones find themselves and return, they are never again right in their <mark4>heads.</mark4><br>
--Pretty Shield, Medicine Woman of the Crows transcribed and edited by Frank Linderman (1932)<br>
All night I am the doe, <mark4>breathing</mark4><br>
his name in a frozen <mark4>field,</mark4><br>
the small mist of the <mark4>word</mark4><br>
drifting always before <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
<br>
And again he has heard <mark4>it</mark4><br>
and I have gone <mark4>burning</mark4><br>
to meet him, the jacklight   <br>
fills my eyes with blue fire;   <br>
the heart in my <mark4>chest</mark4><br>
explodes like a hot <mark4>stone.</mark4><br>
<br>
Then slung like a <mark4>sack</mark4><br>
in the back of his pickup, <br>
I wipe the death <mark4>scum</mark4><br>
from my mouth, sit up <mark4>laughing</mark4><br>
and shriek in my speeding <mark4>grave.</mark4><br>
<br>
Safely shut in the garage, <br>
when he sharpens his knife <br>
and thinks to have me, like <mark4>that,</mark4><br>
I come toward <mark4>him,</mark4><br>
a lean gray witch <br>
through the bullets that enter and <mark4>dissolve.</mark4><br>
<br>
I sit in his <mark4>house</mark4><br>
drinking coffee till <mark4>dawn</mark4><br>
and leave as frost reddens on <mark4>hubcaps,</mark4><br>
crawling back into my shadowy body. <br>
All day, asleep in clean <mark4>grasses,</mark4><br>
I dream of the one who could really wound <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
Not with weapons, not with a kiss, not with a <mark4>look.</mark4><br>
Not even with his <mark4>goodness.</mark4><br>
<br>
If a man was never to lie to <mark1>me</mark1>, Never lie <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
I swear I would never leave <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
