Title : The Moss of His Skin <br>
Author : Anne Sexton <br><br>

Young girls in old Arabia were often buried alive next to their dead fathers, apparently as sacrifice to the goddesses of the tribes ... Harold Feldman, "Children of the Desert" Psychoanalysis and Psychoanalytic Review, Fall 1958 <br>
It was only important <br>
to smile and hold <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
to lie down beside him <br>
and to rest <mark4>awhile,</mark4><br>
to be folded up <mark4>together</mark4><br>
as if we were <mark4>silk,</mark4><br>
to sink from the eyes of <mark4>mother</mark4><br>
and not to <mark4>talk.</mark4><br>
The black room took <mark4>us</mark4><br>
like a cave or a <mark4>mouth</mark4><br>
or an indoor <mark4>belly.</mark4><br>
I held my <mark4>breath</mark4><br>
and daddy was there, <br>
his thumbs, his fat <mark4>skull,</mark4><br>
his teeth, his hair growing   <br>
like a field or a <mark4>shawl.</mark4><br>
I lay by the <mark4>moss</mark4><br>
of his skin <mark4>until</mark4><br>
it grew strange. My sisters   <br>
will never know that I <mark4>fall</mark4><br>
out of myself and pretend   <br>
that Allah will not <mark3>see</mark3><br>
how I hold my <mark4>daddy</mark4><br>
like an old stone <mark3>tree.</mark3><br>
