Title : Killing Floor <br>

1. RUSSIA, 1927 <br>
<br>
On the day the sienna-skinned <mark4>man</mark4><br>
held my shoulders between his spade-shaped <mark4>hands,</mark4><br>
easing me down into the azure water of <mark4>Jordan,</mark4><br>
I woke ninety-three million miles from myself, <br>
Lev Davidovich <mark4>Bronstein,</mark4><br>
shoulder-deep in the <mark4>Volga,</mark4><br>
while the cheap dye of my black silk shirt darkened the <mark4>water.</mark4><br>
<br>
My head wet, water caught in my <mark4>lashes.</mark4><br>
Am I <mark4>blind?</mark4><br>
I rub my eyes, then wade back to <mark4>shore,</mark4><br>
undress and lie <mark4>down,</mark4><br>
until Stalin comes from his place beneath the birch tree. <br>
He folds my <mark4>clothes</mark4><br>
and I button myself in my marmot <mark4>coat,</mark4><br>
and together we start the long walk back to Moscow. <br>
He doesn't ask, what did you see in the <mark4>river?,</mark4><br>
but I hear the hosts of a man drowning in water and <mark4>holiness,</mark4><br>
the castrati voices I can't <mark4>recognize,</mark4><br>
skating on knives, from trees, from <mark4>air</mark4><br>
on the thin ice of my last night in <mark4>Russia.</mark4><br>
Leon Trotsky. <mark4>Bread.</mark4><br>
I want to scream, but silence holds my <mark4>tongue</mark4><br>
with small spade-shaped <mark1>hands</mark1><br>
and only this comes, so <mark4>quietly</mark4><br>
Stalin has to press his ear to my mouth:   <br>
I have only myself. Put me on the <mark4>train.</mark4><br>
I won't look <mark4>back.</mark4><br>
<br>
2. MEXICO, <mark1>1940</mark1><br>
At noon today, I woke from a <mark4>nightmare:</mark4><br>
<br>
my friend Jacques ran toward me with an <mark4>ax,</mark4><br>
as I stepped from the train in <mark4>Alma-Ata.</mark4><br>
He was dressed in yellow satin pants and <mark4>shirt.</mark4><br>
A marigold in <mark4>winter.</mark4><br>
When I held out my arms to embrace <mark4>him,</mark4><br>
he raised the ax and struck me at the <mark4>neck,</mark4><br>
my head fell to one side, hanging only by <mark4>skin.</mark4><br>
A river of sighs poured from the <mark4>cut.</mark4><br>
3. MEXICO, August 20, <mark1>1940</mark1><br>
<br>
The machine-gun <mark4>bullets</mark4><br>
hit my wife in the <mark4>legs,</mark4><br>
<br>
then zigzagged up her <mark4>body.</mark4><br>
I took the shears, cut open her <mark4>gown</mark4><br>
and lay on top of her for <mark4>hours.</mark4><br>
Blood soaked through my <mark1>clothes</mark1><br>
and when I tried to rise, I <mark4>couldn't.</mark4><br>
I wake then. Another <mark1>nightmare.</mark1><br>
I rise from my desk, walk to the <mark4>bedroom</mark4><br>
<br>
and sit down at my wife's mirrored <mark4>vanity.</mark4><br>
I rouge my cheeks and <mark4>lips,</mark4><br>
stare at my bone-white, speckled egg of a <mark4>face:</mark4><br>
lined and <mark4>empty.</mark4><br>
I lean forward and see Jacques's <mark4>reflection.</mark4><br>
I half-turn, smile, then turn back to the <mark4>mirror.</mark4><br>
He moves from the doorway,   <br>
lifts the pickax <br>
and strikes the top of my <mark3>head.</mark3><br>
My brain <mark4>splits.</mark4><br>
The pickax keeps <mark4>going</mark4><br>
and when it hits the tile <mark4>floor,</mark4><br>
it flies from his <mark1>hands,</mark1><br>
a black dove on whose back I <mark4>ride,</mark4><br>
two men, one <mark4>cursing,</mark4><br>
the other blessing all <mark4>things:</mark4><br>
Lev Davidovich <mark1>Bronstein,</mark1><br>
I step from Jordan without you.<br>
