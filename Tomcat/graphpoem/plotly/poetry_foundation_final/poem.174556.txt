Author : Algernon Charles Swinburne <br><br>

In the month of the long decline of <mark4>roses</mark4><br>
I, beholding the summer dead before me, <br>
Set my face to the sea and journeyed <mark4>silent,</mark4><br>
Gazing eagerly where above the <mark5>sea-mark</mark5><br>
Flame as fierce as the fervid eyes of <mark4>lions</mark4><br>
Half divided the eyelids of the <mark4>sunset;</mark4><br>
Till I heard as it were a noise of <mark4>waters</mark4><br>
Moving tremulous under feet of <mark4>angels</mark4><br>
Multitudinous, out of all the <mark4>heavens;</mark4><br>
Knew the fluttering wind, the fluttered foliage, <br>
Shaken fitfully, full of sound and shadow; <br>
And saw, trodden upon by noiseless <mark1>angels,</mark1><br>
Long mysterious reaches fed with <mark4>moonlight,</mark4><br>
Sweet sad straits in a soft subsiding channel, <br>
Blown about by the lips of winds I knew <mark4>not,</mark4><br>
Winds not born in the north nor any <mark4>quarter,</mark4><br>
Winds not warm with the south nor any <mark5>sunshine;</mark5><br>
Heard between them a voice of exultation, <br>
"Lo, the summer is <mark4>dead</mark4>, the sun is <mark4>faded,</mark4><br>
Even like as a leaf the year is <mark4>withered,</mark4><br>
All the fruits of the day from all her <mark4>branches</mark4><br>
Gathered, neither is any left to <mark4>gather.</mark4><br>
All the flowers are dead, the tender <mark4>blossoms,</mark4><br>
All are taken away; the season <mark4>wasted,</mark4><br>
Like an ember among the fallen <mark4>ashes.</mark4><br>
Now with light of the winter days, with <mark1>moonlight,</mark1><br>
Light of snow, and the bitter light of hoarfrost, <br>
We bring flowers that fade not after autumn, <br>
Pale white chaplets and crowns of latter <mark4>seasons,</mark4><br>
Fair false leaves (but the summer leaves were falser), <br>
Woven under the eyes of stars and planets <br>
When low light was upon the windy <mark4>reaches</mark4><br>
Where the flower of foam was blown, a lily <br>
Dropt among the sonorous fruitless furrows <br>
And green fields of the sea that make no <mark4>pasture:</mark4><br>
Since the winter begins, the weeping <mark4>winter,</mark4><br>
All whose flowers are <mark4>tears</mark4>, and round his <mark4>temples</mark4><br>
Iron blossom of frost is bound for <mark4>ever."</mark4><br>
