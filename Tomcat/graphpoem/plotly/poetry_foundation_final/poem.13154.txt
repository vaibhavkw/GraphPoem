Title : Deep South<br>
Author : Thomas McGrath<br><br>

Baton Rouge, 1940<br>
These are savannas bluer than your <mark4>dreams</mark4><br>
Where other loves are fashioned to older <mark4>music,</mark4><br>
And the romantic in his light <mark4>boat</mark4><br>
Puts out among flamingos and water <mark4>moccasins</mark4><br>
Looking for the river that went by last <mark4>year.</mark4><br>
<br>
Even the angels wear confederate <mark4>uniforms;</mark4><br>
And when the magnolia blooms and the honeysuckle, <br>
Golden lovers, brighter than the <mark4>moon,</mark4><br>
Read Catullus in the flaring <mark4>light</mark4><br>
Of the burning Negro in the open eye of <mark4>midnight.</mark4><br>
<br>
And the Traveller, moving in the hot <mark4>swamps,</mark4><br>
Where every human sympathy sends up the <mark4>temperature,</mark4><br>
Comes of a sudden on the hidden <mark4>glacier,</mark4><br>
Whose motives are blonder than Hitler's choir <mark4>boys.</mark4><br>
<br>
Here is the ambiguous tenderness of 'gators <br>
Trumpeting their loves along a hundred <mark4>miles</mark4><br>
Of rivers writhing under trees like <mark4>myths--</mark4><br>
And human existence pursues the <mark4>last,</mark4><br>
The simple and desperate life of the <mark4>senses.</mark4><br>
Since love survives only as ironic <mark4>legend--</mark4><br>
Response to situations no longer <mark4>present--</mark4><br>
Men lacking dignity are seized by <mark4>pride,</mark4><br>
Which is the easy upper-class <mark4>infection.</mark4><br>
<br>
The masters are at home in this merciless <mark4>climate</mark4><br>
But deep in the caves of their minds some animal <mark4>memory</mark4><br>
Warns of the fate of the mammoth at the end of the <mark5>ice-age;</mark5><br>
As sleeping children a toy, they hug the last, fatal <mark4>error,</mark4><br>
But their eyes are awake and their dreams shake as with <mark4>palsy.</mark4><br>
<br>
Over Birmingham where the blast furnace <mark4>flowers</mark4><br>
And beyond the piney woods in cotton <mark4>country,</mark4><br>
Continually puzzling the pale <mark4>aristocrats,</mark4><br>
The sun burns equally white man and <mark4>black.</mark4><br>
<br>
The labor which they do makes more and <mark4>more</mark4><br>
Their brotherhood condition for their whole <mark4>existence;</mark4><br>
They mint their own light, and their fusing <mark4>fires</mark4><br>
Will melt at last these centuries of <mark4>ice.</mark4><br>
<br>
This is a nightmare nimble in the Big <mark4>House,</mark4><br>
Where sleepers are wakeful, cuddling their <mark3>terror,</mark3><br>
In the empty acres of their rich beds, <mark5>dreaming</mark5><br>
Of bones in museums, where the black boys <mark4>yawn.</mark4><br>
