Title : from Troilus and Cressida <br>
Author : John Dryden <br><br>

Can life be a <mark3>blessing,</mark3><br>
Or worth the <mark3>possessing,</mark3><br>
Can life be a blessing if love were <mark3>away?</mark3><br>
Ah no! though our love all night keep us <mark4>waking,</mark4><br>
And though he torment us with cares all the <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
Yet he sweetens, he sweetens our pains in the <mark3>taking,</mark3><br>
There's an hour at the last, there's an hour to <mark3>repay.</mark3><br>
<br>
In ev'ry <mark1>possessing,</mark1><br>
The ravishing <mark1>blessing,</mark1><br>
In ev'ry possessing the fruit of our <mark3>pain,</mark3><br>
Poor lovers forget long ages of <mark3>anguish,</mark3><br>
Whate'er they have suffer'd and done to <mark3>obtain;</mark3><br>
'Tis a pleasure, a pleasure to sigh and to <mark3>languish,</mark3><br>
When we hope, when we hope to be happy <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
