felled 1879<br>
My aspens dear, whose airy cages <mark3>quelled,</mark3><br>
Quelled or quenched in leaves the leaping <mark3>sun,</mark3><br>
All <mark1>felled</mark1>, felled, are all <mark3>felled;</mark3><br>
Of a fresh and following folded <mark3>rank</mark3><br>
Not spared, not <mark3>one</mark3><br>
That dandled a <mark5>sandalled</mark5><br>
Shadow that swam or <mark3>sank</mark3><br>
On meadow & river & wind-wandering weed-winding <mark3>bank.</mark3><br>
<br>
O if we but knew what we <mark3>do</mark3><br>
When we delve or hew <mark3>--</mark3><br>
Hack and rack the growing <mark4>green!</mark4><br>
Since country is so <mark3>tender</mark3><br>
To touch, her being so <mark3>slender,</mark3><br>
That, like this sleek and seeing <mark3>ball</mark3><br>
But a prick will make no eye at <mark3>all,</mark3><br>
Where we, even where we <mark3>mean</mark3><br>
                 To mend her we end her, <br>
When we hew or <mark3>delve:</mark3><br>
After-comers cannot guess the beauty <mark4>been.</mark4><br>
Ten or <mark1>twelve</mark1>, only ten or <mark3>twelve</mark3><br>
     Strokes of havoc unselve <br>
The sweet especial <mark4>scene,</mark4><br>
Rural <mark1>scene</mark1>, a rural <mark1>scene,</mark1><br>
Sweet especial rural <mark1>scene.</mark1><br>
