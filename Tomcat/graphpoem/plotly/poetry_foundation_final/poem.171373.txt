Title : To the Harbormaster <br>
Author : Frank O'Hara <br><br>

I wanted to be sure to reach <mark3>you;</mark3><br>
though my ship was on the way it got <mark4>caught</mark4><br>
in some moorings. I am always tying up   <br>
and then deciding to depart. In storms <mark4>and</mark4><br>
at sunset, with the metallic coils of the <mark4>tide</mark4><br>
around my fathomless arms, I am unable   <br>
to understand the forms of my vanity   <br>
or I am hard alee with my Polish <mark4>rudder</mark4><br>
in my hand and the sun sinking. <mark3>To</mark3><br>
you I offer my hull and the tattered cordage   <br>
of my will. The terrible channels where   <br>
the wind drives me against the brown lips   <br>
of the reeds are not all behind me. <mark4>Yet</mark4><br>
I trust the sanity of my vessel; <mark1>and</mark1><br>
if it sinks, it may well be in <mark4>answer</mark4><br>
to the reasoning of the eternal voices, <br>
the waves which have kept me from reaching <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
