Title : Autobiography <br>
Author : Lawrence Ferlinghetti <br><br>

I am leading a quiet <mark1>life</mark1><br>
in Mike's Place every <mark1>day</mark1><br>
watching the <mark4>champs</mark4><br>
of the Dante Billiard <mark4>Parlor</mark4><br>
and the French pinball <mark4>addicts.</mark4><br>
I am leading a quiet <mark1>life</mark1><br>
on lower East <mark3>Broadway.</mark3><br>
I am an <mark4>American.</mark4><br>
I was an American boy. <br>
I read the American Boy <mark4>Magazine</mark4><br>
and became a boy <mark4>scout</mark4><br>
in the <mark4>suburbs.</mark4><br>
I thought I was Tom <mark4>Sawyer</mark4><br>
catching crayfish in the Bronx <mark4>River</mark4><br>
and imagining the <mark4>Mississippi.</mark4><br>
I had a baseball <mark4>mit</mark4><br>
and an American Flyer <mark4>bike.</mark4><br>
I delivered the Woman's Home <mark4>Companion</mark4><br>
at five in the <mark4>afternoon</mark4><br>
or the Herald <mark3>Trib</mark3><br>
at five in the <mark4>morning.</mark4><br>
I still can hear the paper <mark4>thump</mark4><br>
on lost <mark4>porches.</mark4><br>
I had an unhappy <mark4>childhood.</mark4><br>
I saw Lindbergh <mark4>land.</mark4><br>
I looked <mark4>homeward</mark4><br>
and saw no <mark4>angel.</mark4><br>
I got caught stealing <mark4>pencils</mark4><br>
from the Five and Ten Cent <mark4>Store</mark4><br>
the same month I made Eagle <mark1>Scout.</mark1><br>
I chopped trees for the CCC   <br>
and sat on <mark4>them.</mark4><br>
I landed in <mark4>Normandy</mark4><br>
in a rowboat that turned <mark4>over.</mark4><br>
I have seen the educated <mark4>armies</mark4><br>
on the beach at <mark3>Dover.</mark3><br>
I have seen Egyptian pilots in purple <mark4>clouds</mark4><br>
shopkeepers rolling up their <mark4>blinds</mark4><br>
at <mark3>midday</mark3><br>
potato salad and <mark4>dandelions</mark4><br>
at anarchist <mark4>picnics.</mark4><br>
I am reading 'Lorna Doone' <br>
and a life of John <mark4>Most</mark4><br>
terror of the <mark4>industrialist</mark4><br>
a bomb on his desk at all <mark4>times.</mark4><br>
I have seen the garbagemen <mark4>parade</mark4><br>
in the Columbus Day <mark1>Parade</mark1><br>
behind the <mark3>glib</mark3><br>
farting trumpeters. <br>
I have not been out to the <mark4>Cloisters</mark4><br>
in a long <mark4>time</mark4><br>
nor to the Tuileries <br>
but I still keep <mark4>thinking</mark4><br>
of <mark4>going.</mark4><br>
I have seen the garbagemen <mark1>parade</mark1><br>
when it was <mark3>snowing.</mark3><br>
I have eaten hotdogs in <mark4>ballparks.</mark4><br>
I have heard the Gettysburg <mark4>Address</mark4><br>
and the Ginsberg <mark1>Address.</mark1><br>
I like it <mark4>here</mark4><br>
and I won't go <mark4>back</mark4><br>
where I came <mark4>from.</mark4><br>
I too have ridden boxcars boxcars <mark4>boxcars.</mark4><br>
I have travelled among unknown <mark4>men.</mark4><br>
I have been in <mark4>Asia</mark4><br>
with Noah in the <mark4>Ark.</mark4><br>
I was in <mark4>India</mark4><br>
when Rome was <mark4>built.</mark4><br>
I have been in the <mark4>Manger</mark4><br>
with an <mark4>Ass.</mark4><br>
I have seen the Eternal <mark4>Distributor</mark4><br>
from a White <mark4>Hill</mark4><br>
in South San <mark4>Francisco</mark4><br>
and the Laughing Woman at Loona <mark3>Park</mark3><br>
outside the Fun <mark4>House</mark4><br>
in a great <mark4>rainstorm</mark4><br>
still <mark4>laughing.</mark4><br>
I have heard the sound of <mark4>revelry</mark4><br>
by <mark4>night.</mark4><br>
I have wandered <mark4>lonely</mark4><br>
as a <mark4>crowd.</mark4><br>
I am leading a quiet <mark1>life</mark1><br>
outside of Mike's Place every <mark1>day</mark1><br>
watching the world walk <mark3>by</mark3><br>
in its curious <mark4>shoes.</mark4><br>
I once started <mark4>out</mark4><br>
to walk around the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
but ended up in <mark4>Brooklyn.</mark4><br>
That Bridge was too much for <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
I have engaged in <mark4>silence</mark4><br>
exile and <mark4>cunning.</mark4><br>
I flew too near the <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
and my wax wings fell <mark4>off.</mark4><br>
I am looking for my Old <mark4>Man</mark4><br>
whom I never <mark3>knew.</mark3><br>
I am looking for the Lost <mark4>Leader</mark4><br>
with whom I <mark3>flew.</mark3><br>
Young men should be <mark4>explorers.</mark4><br>
Home is where one starts <mark1>from.</mark1><br>
But Mother never told <mark1>me</mark1><br>
there'd be scenes like <mark4>this.</mark4><br>
<br>
I <mark4>rest</mark4><br>
I have <mark4>travelled.</mark4><br>
I have seen goof <mark4>city.</mark4><br>
I have seen the mass <mark4>mess.</mark4><br>
I have heard Kid Ory <mark3>cry.</mark3><br>
I have heard a trombone preach.   <br>
I have heard <mark4>Debussy</mark4><br>
strained thru a <mark4>sheet.</mark4><br>
I have slept in a hundred <mark4>islands</mark4><br>
where books were <mark4>trees.</mark4><br>
I have heard the <mark4>birds</mark4><br>
that sound like <mark4>bells.</mark4><br>
I have worn grey flannel <mark4>trousers</mark4><br>
and walked upon the beach of <mark4>hell.</mark4><br>
I have dwelt in a hundred <mark4>cities</mark4><br>
where trees were <mark4>books.</mark4><br>
What subways what taxis what <mark4>cafes!</mark4><br>
What women with blind <mark4>breasts</mark4><br>
limbs lost among <mark4>skyscrapers!</mark4><br>
I have seen the statues of <mark4>heroes</mark4><br>
at carrefours. <br>
Danton weeping at a metro <mark4>entrance</mark4><br>
Columbus in <mark4>Barcelona</mark4><br>
pointing Westward up the Ramblas <br>
toward the American <mark4>Express</mark4><br>
Lincoln in his stony <mark4>chair</mark4><br>
And a great Stone <mark4>Face</mark4><br>
in North <mark4>Dakota.</mark4><br>
I know that <mark4>Columbus</mark4><br>
did not invent <mark4>America.</mark4><br>
I have heard a hundred housebroken Ezra <mark4>Pounds.</mark4><br>
They should all be <mark4>freed.</mark4><br>
It is long since I was a <mark5>herdsman.</mark5><br>
I am leading a quiet <mark1>life</mark1><br>
in Mike's Place every <mark1>day</mark1><br>
reading the Classified <mark4>columns.</mark4><br>
I have read the Reader's <mark4>Digest</mark4><br>
from cover to <mark4>cover</mark4><br>
and noted the close <mark4>identification</mark4><br>
of the United States and the Promised <mark1>Land</mark1><br>
where every coin is <mark4>marked</mark4><br>
In God We <mark4>Trust</mark4><br>
but the dollar bills do not have <mark4>it</mark4><br>
being gods unto <mark4>themselves.</mark4><br>
I read the Want Ads <mark4>daily</mark4><br>
looking for a stone a <mark4>leaf</mark4><br>
an unfound <mark4>door.</mark4><br>
I hear America <mark4>singing</mark4><br>
in the Yellow <mark4>Pages.</mark4><br>
One could never <mark3>tell</mark3><br>
the soul has its <mark3>rages.</mark3><br>
I read the papers every <mark1>day</mark1><br>
and hear humanity <mark4>amiss</mark4><br>
in the sad plethora of <mark4>print.</mark4><br>
I see where Walden Pond has been <mark4>drained</mark4><br>
to make an amusement <mark1>park.</mark1><br>
I see they're making <mark4>Melville</mark4><br>
eat his <mark4>whale.</mark4><br>
I see another war is <mark4>coming</mark4><br>
but I won't be there to fight <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
I have read the <mark4>writing</mark4><br>
on the outhouse <mark4>wall.</mark4><br>
I helped Kilroy write <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
I marched up Fifth <mark1>Avenue</mark1><br>
blowing on a bugle in a tight <mark4>platoon</mark4><br>
but hurried back to the <mark4>Casbah</mark4><br>
looking for my <mark3>dog.</mark3><br>
I see a <mark4>similarity</mark4><br>
between dogs and <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
Dogs are the true <mark4>observers</mark4><br>
walking up and down the <mark1>world</mark1><br>
thru the Molloy <mark4>country.</mark4><br>
I have walked down <mark4>alleys</mark4><br>
too narrow for <mark4>Chryslers.</mark4><br>
I have seen a hundred horseless milkwagons   <br>
in a vacant lot in <mark4>Astoria.</mark4><br>
Ben Shahn never painted <mark1>them</mark1><br>
but they're <mark4>there</mark4><br>
askew in <mark1>Astoria.</mark1><br>
I have heard the junkman's obbligato.   <br>
I have ridden <mark4>superhighways</mark4><br>
and believed the billboard's <mark4>promises</mark4><br>
Crossed the Jersey <mark4>Flats</mark4><br>
and seen the Cities of the <mark4>Plain</mark4><br>
And wallowed in the wilds of <mark4>Westchester</mark4><br>
with its roving bands of <mark4>natives</mark4><br>
in stationwagons. <br>
I have seen <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
I am the <mark1>man.</mark1><br>
I was <mark1>there.</mark1><br>
I <mark4>suffered</mark4><br>
<br>
I am an <mark1>American.</mark1><br>
I have a <mark4>passport.</mark4><br>
I did not suffer in <mark4>public.</mark4><br>
And I'm too young to <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
I am a selfmade <mark1>man.</mark1><br>
And I have plans for the <mark4>future.</mark4><br>
I am in <mark4>line</mark4><br>
for a top <mark4>job.</mark4><br>
I may be moving <mark4>on</mark4><br>
to <mark4>Detroit.</mark4><br>
I am only <mark4>temporarily</mark4><br>
a tie <mark4>salesman.</mark4><br>
I am a good Joe. <br>
I am an open <mark4>book</mark4><br>
to my <mark4>boss.</mark4><br>
I am a complete <mark4>mystery</mark4><br>
to my closest <mark4>friends.</mark4><br>
I am leading a quiet <mark1>life</mark1><br>
in Mike's Place every <mark1>day</mark1><br>
contemplating my <mark4>navel.</mark4><br>
I am a <mark4>part</mark4><br>
of the body's long <mark4>madness.</mark4><br>
I have wandered in various <mark5>nightwoods.</mark5><br>
I have leaned in drunken <mark4>doorways.</mark4><br>
I have written wild <mark4>stories</mark4><br>
without <mark4>punctuation.</mark4><br>
I am the <mark1>man.</mark1><br>
I was <mark1>there.</mark1><br>
I <mark1>suffered</mark1><br>
<br>
I have sat in an uneasy <mark1>chair.</mark1><br>
I am a tear of the <mark1>sun.</mark1><br>
I am a <mark1>hill</mark1><br>
where poets <mark3>run.</mark3><br>
I invented the <mark4>alphabet</mark4><br>
after watching the flight of <mark4>cranes</mark4><br>
who made letters with their <mark4>legs.</mark4><br>
I am a lake upon a <mark1>plain.</mark1><br>
I am a <mark4>word</mark4><br>
in a <mark3>tree.</mark3><br>
I am a hill of <mark4>poetry.</mark4><br>
I am a <mark4>raid</mark4><br>
on the <mark4>inarticulate.</mark4><br>
I have <mark4>dreamt</mark4><br>
that all my teeth fell <mark1>out</mark1><br>
but my tongue <mark4>lived</mark4><br>
to tell the <mark4>tale.</mark4><br>
For I am a <mark4>still</mark4><br>
of <mark1>poetry.</mark1><br>
I am a bank of <mark4>song.</mark4><br>
I am a <mark5>playerpiano</mark5><br>
in an abandoned <mark4>casino</mark4><br>
on a seaside <mark4>esplanade</mark4><br>
in a dense <mark3>fog</mark3><br>
still <mark4>playing.</mark4><br>
I see a <mark1>similarity</mark1><br>
between the Laughing <mark4>Woman</mark4><br>
and <mark4>myself.</mark4><br>
I have heard the sound of <mark4>summer</mark4><br>
in the <mark4>rain.</mark4><br>
I have seen girls on <mark4>boardwalks</mark4><br>
have complicated <mark4>sensations.</mark4><br>
I understand their <mark3>hesitations.</mark3><br>
I am a gatherer of <mark4>fruit.</mark4><br>
I have seen how <mark4>kisses</mark4><br>
cause <mark3>euphoria.</mark3><br>
I have risked <mark4>enchantment.</mark4><br>
I have seen the <mark4>Virgin</mark4><br>
in an appletree at <mark4>Chartres</mark4><br>
And Saint Joan <mark4>burn</mark4><br>
at the Bella <mark4>Union.</mark4><br>
I have seen giraffes in junglejims <br>
their necks like love <br>
wound around the iron <mark4>circumstances</mark4><br>
of the <mark1>world.</mark1><br>
I have seen the Venus <mark4>Aphrodite</mark4><br>
armless in her drafty <mark4>corridor.</mark4><br>
I have heard a siren <mark4>sing</mark4><br>
at One Fifth <mark1>Avenue.</mark1><br>
I have seen the White Goddess <mark4>dancing</mark4><br>
in the Rue des Beaux <mark4>Arts</mark4><br>
on the Fourteenth of <mark3>July</mark3><br>
and the Beautiful Dame Without <mark4>Mercy</mark4><br>
picking her nose in <mark4>Chumley's.</mark4><br>
She did not speak English.   <br>
She had yellow <mark3>hair</mark3><br>
and a hoarse <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
I am leading a quiet <mark1>life</mark1><br>
in Mike's Place every <mark1>day</mark1><br>
watching the pocket pool <mark4>players</mark4><br>
making the minestrone <mark4>scene</mark4><br>
wolfing the macaronis   <br>
and I have read <mark4>somewhere</mark4><br>
the Meaning of <mark4>Existence</mark4><br>
yet have <mark4>forgotten</mark4><br>
just exactly <mark4>where.</mark4><br>
But I am the <mark1>man</mark1><br>
And I'll be <mark1>there.</mark1><br>
And I may cause the <mark4>lips</mark4><br>
of those who are <mark4>asleep</mark4><br>
to <mark4>speak.</mark4><br>
And I may make my <mark4>notebooks</mark4><br>
into sheaves of <mark4>grass.</mark4><br>
And I may write my <mark4>own</mark4><br>
eponymous <mark4>epitaph</mark4><br>
instructing the <mark4>horsemen</mark4><br>
to <mark3>pass.</mark3><br>
