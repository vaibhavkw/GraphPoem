Title : To -- -- --. Ulalume: A Ballad <br>
Author : Edgar Allan Poe <br><br>

The skies they were ashen and <mark3>sober;</mark3><br>
The leaves they were crisped and <mark1>sere--</mark1><br>
The leaves they were withering and <mark1>sere;</mark1><br>
It was night in the lonesome <mark3>October</mark3><br>
Of my most immemorial <mark3>year;</mark3><br>
It was hard by the dim lake of <mark4>Auber,</mark4><br>
In the misty mid region of <mark4>Weir--</mark4><br>
It was down by the dank tarn of <mark1>Auber,</mark1><br>
In the ghoul-haunted woodland of <mark1>Weir.</mark1><br>
<br>
Here once, through an alley <mark3>Titanic,</mark3><br>
Of cypress, I roamed with my <mark1>Soul--</mark1><br>
Of cypress, with Psyche, my <mark1>Soul.</mark1><br>
These were days when my heart was <mark3>volcanic</mark3><br>
As the scoriac rivers that <mark3>roll--</mark3><br>
As the lavas that restlessly <mark1>roll</mark1><br>
Their sulphurous currents down <mark1>Yaanek</mark1><br>
In the ultimate climes of the <mark3>pole--</mark3><br>
That groan as they roll down Mount <mark1>Yaanek</mark1><br>
In the realms of the boreal <mark1>pole.</mark1><br>
<br>
Our talk had been serious and <mark1>sober,</mark1><br>
But our thoughts they were palsied and <mark1>sere--</mark1><br>
Our memories were treacherous and <mark1>sere--</mark1><br>
For we knew not the month was <mark1>October,</mark1><br>
And we marked not the night of the <mark1>year--</mark1><br>
(Ah, night of all nights in the <mark1>year!)</mark1><br>
We noted not the dim lake of <mark1>Auber--</mark1><br>
(Though once we had journeyed down <mark4>here)--</mark4><br>
We remembered not the dank tarn of <mark1>Auber,</mark1><br>
Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of <mark1>Weir.</mark1><br>
<br>
And now, as the night was senescent <br>
And star-dials pointed to <mark1>morn--</mark1><br>
As the star-dials hinted of <mark1>morn--</mark1><br>
At the end of our path a liquescent <br>
And nebulous lustre was <mark3>born,</mark3><br>
Out of which a miraculous <mark1>crescent</mark1><br>
Arose with a duplicate <mark3>horn--</mark3><br>
Astarte's bediamonded <mark1>crescent</mark1><br>
Distinct with its duplicate <mark1>horn.</mark1><br>
<br>
And I said--"She is warmer than <mark4>Dian:</mark4><br>
She rolls through an ether of <mark1>sighs--</mark1><br>
She revels in a region of <mark1>sighs:</mark1><br>
She has seen that the tears are not dry <mark4>on</mark4><br>
These cheeks, where the worm never <mark3>dies,</mark3><br>
And has come past the stars of the <mark4>Lion</mark4><br>
To point us the path to the <mark3>skies--</mark3><br>
To the Lethean peace of the <mark1>skies--</mark1><br>
Come up, in despite of the <mark1>Lion,</mark1><br>
To shine on us with her bright <mark3>eyes--</mark3><br>
Come up through the lair of the <mark1>Lion,</mark1><br>
With love in her luminous <mark1>eyes."</mark1><br>
<br>
But Psyche, uplifting her <mark4>finger,</mark4><br>
Said--"Sadly this star I <mark4>mistrust--</mark4><br>
Her pallor I strangely <mark1>mistrust:--</mark1><br>
Oh, hasten! oh, let us not <mark3>linger!</mark3><br>
Oh, fly!--let us fly!--for we <mark3>must."</mark3><br>
In terror she spoke, letting sink <mark5>her</mark5><br>
Wings till they trailed in the <mark3>dust--</mark3><br>
In agony sobbed, letting sink <mark1>her</mark1><br>
Plumes till they trailed in the <mark1>dust--</mark1><br>
Till they sorrowfully trailed in the <mark1>dust.</mark1><br>
<br>
I replied--"This is nothing but <mark3>dreaming:</mark3><br>
Let us on by this tremulous <mark4>light!</mark4><br>
Let us bathe in this crystalline <mark1>light!</mark1><br>
Its Sybilic splendor is <mark3>beaming</mark3><br>
With Hope and in Beauty <mark3>to-night:--</mark3><br>
See!--it flickers up the sky through the <mark3>night!</mark3><br>
Ah, we safely may trust to its <mark3>gleaming,</mark3><br>
And be sure it will lead us <mark1>aright--</mark1><br>
We safely may trust to a <mark1>gleaming</mark1><br>
That cannot but guide us <mark1>aright,</mark1><br>
Since it flickers up to Heaven through the <mark1>night."</mark1><br>
<br>
Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
And tempted her out of her <mark1>gloom--</mark1><br>
And conquered her scruples and <mark1>gloom:</mark1><br>
And we passed to the end of the vista, <br>
But were stopped by the door of a <mark3>tomb--</mark3><br>
By the door of a legended <mark1>tomb;</mark1><br>
And I said--"What is written, sweet <mark4>sister,</mark4><br>
On the door of this legended <mark1>tomb?"</mark1><br>
      She replied--"Ulalume--Ulalume-- <br>
      'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!" <br>
<br>
Then my heart it grew ashen and <mark1>sober</mark1><br>
As the leaves that were crisped and <mark1>sere--</mark1><br>
As the leaves that were withering and <mark1>sere,</mark1><br>
And I cried--"It was surely <mark1>October</mark1><br>
On this very night of last <mark1>year</mark1><br>
That I journeyed--I journeyed down <mark1>here--</mark1><br>
That I brought a dread burden down <mark1>here--</mark1><br>
On this night of all nights in the <mark1>year,</mark1><br>
Oh, what demon has tempted me <mark1>here?</mark1><br>
Well I know, now, this dim lake of <mark1>Auber--</mark1><br>
This misty mid region of <mark1>Weir--</mark1><br>
Well I know, now, this dank tarn of <mark1>Auber--</mark1><br>
In the ghoul-haunted woodland of <mark1>Weir."</mark1><br>
<br>
Said we, then--the two, then--"Ah, can <mark4>it</mark4><br>
Have been that the woodlandish <mark4>ghouls--</mark4><br>
The pitiful, the merciful <mark1>ghouls--</mark1><br>
To bar up our way and to ban <mark1>it</mark1><br>
From the secret that lies in these <mark1>wolds--</mark1><br>
From the thing that lies hidden in these <mark1>wolds--</mark1><br>
Had drawn up the spectre of a <mark4>planet</mark4><br>
From the limbo of lunary <mark4>souls--</mark4><br>
This sinfully scintillant <mark1>planet</mark1><br>
From the Hell of the planetary <mark1>souls?"</mark1><br>
