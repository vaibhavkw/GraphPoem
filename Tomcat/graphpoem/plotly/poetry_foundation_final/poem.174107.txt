Title : A Night-Piece on Death <br>
Author : Thomas Parnell <br><br>

By the blue taper's trembling <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
No more I waste the wakeful <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
Intent with endless view to <mark4>pore</mark4><br>
The schoolmen and the sages <mark4>o'er:</mark4><br>
Their books from wisdom widely <mark3>stray,</mark3><br>
Or point at best the longest <mark3>way.</mark3><br>
I'll seek a readier path, and <mark3>go</mark3><br>
Where wisdom's surely taught <mark3>below.</mark3><br>
How deep yon azure dyes the <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
Where orbs of gold unnumbered <mark3>lie,</mark3><br>
While through their ranks in silver <mark3>pride</mark3><br>
The nether crescent seems to <mark3>glide.</mark3><br>
The slumb'ring breeze forgets to breathe, <br>
The lake is smooth and clear beneath, <br>
Where once again the spangled <mark3>show</mark3><br>
Descends to meet our eyes <mark1>below.</mark1><br>
The grounds, which on the right <mark4>aspire,</mark4><br>
In dimness from the view <mark3>retire:</mark3><br>
The left presents a place of <mark4>graves,</mark4><br>
Whose wall the silent water laves. <br>
That steeple guides thy doubtful <mark3>sight</mark3><br>
Among the livid gleams of <mark1>night.</mark1><br>
There pass, with melancholy <mark4>state,</mark4><br>
By all the solemn heaps of <mark3>fate,</mark3><br>
And think, as softly-sad you <mark4>tread</mark4><br>
Above the venerable <mark3>dead,</mark3><br>
"Time was, like thee they life <mark4>possessed,</mark4><br>
And time shall be, that thou shalt <mark3>rest."</mark3><br>
Those graves, with bending osier <mark4>bound,</mark4><br>
That nameless heave the crumpled <mark3>ground,</mark3><br>
Quick to the glancing thought <mark4>disclose</mark4><br>
Where Toil and Poverty <mark3>repose.</mark3><br>
The flat smooth stones that bear a <mark3>name,</mark3><br>
The chisel's slender help to <mark3>fame</mark3><br>
(Which ere our set of friends <mark3>decay</mark3><br>
Their frequent steps may wear <mark3>away),</mark3><br>
A middle race of mortals <mark3>own,</mark3><br>
Men, half ambitious, all <mark3>unknown.</mark3><br>
The marble tombs that rise on <mark3>high,</mark3><br>
Whose dead in vaulted arches <mark1>lie,</mark1><br>
Whose pillars swell with sculptured <mark4>stones,</mark4><br>
Arms, <mark4>angels</mark4>, epitaphs and <mark3>bones,</mark3><br>
These (all the poor remains of <mark1>state)</mark1><br>
Adorn the rich, or praise the <mark3>great;</mark3><br>
Who, while on earth in fame they <mark3>live,</mark3><br>
Are senseless of the fame they <mark3>give.</mark3><br>
Ha! while I <mark4>gaze</mark4>, pale Cynthia <mark4>fades,</mark4><br>
The bursting earth unveils the <mark3>shades!</mark3><br>
All slow and wan, and wrapped with <mark4>shrouds,</mark4><br>
They rise in visionary <mark3>crowds,</mark3><br>
And all with sober accent <mark3>cry,</mark3><br>
"Think, mortal, what it is to <mark3>die."</mark3><br>
Now from yon black and fun'ral <mark3>yew,</mark3><br>
That bathes the charnel-house with <mark3>dew,</mark3><br>
Methinks I hear a voice <mark4>begin</mark4><br>
(Ye ravens, cease your croaking <mark3>din,</mark3><br>
Ye tolling clocks, no time <mark3>resound</mark3><br>
O'er the long lake and midnight <mark1>ground);</mark1><br>
It sends a peal of hollow <mark4>groans,</mark4><br>
Thus speaking from among the <mark1>bones.</mark1><br>
"When men my scythe and darts <mark3>supply,</mark3><br>
How great a King of Fears am <mark3>I!</mark3><br>
They view me like the last of <mark4>things:</mark4><br>
They make, and then they dread, my <mark3>stings.</mark3><br>
Fools! if you less provoked your <mark4>fears,</mark4><br>
No more my spectre-form <mark3>appears.</mark3><br>
Death's but a path that must be <mark4>trod,</mark4><br>
If man would ever pass to <mark3>God;</mark3><br>
A port of <mark4>calms</mark4>, a state of <mark4>ease</mark4><br>
From the rough rage of swelling <mark3>seas.</mark3><br>
"Why then thy flowing sable <mark5>stoles,</mark5><br>
Deep pendant cypress, mourning <mark4>poles,</mark4><br>
Loose scarfs to fall athwart thy <mark4>weeds,</mark4><br>
Long palls, drawn hearses, covered <mark3>steeds,</mark3><br>
And plumes of black, that, as they <mark1>tread,</mark1><br>
Nod o'er the scutcheons of the <mark1>dead?</mark1><br>
"Nor can the parted body <mark3>know,</mark3><br>
Nor wants the soul, these forms of <mark3>woe.</mark3><br>
As men who long in prison <mark3>dwell,</mark3><br>
With lamps that glimmer round the <mark3>cell,</mark3><br>
Whene'er their suffering years are <mark4>run,</mark4><br>
Spring forth to greet the glitt'ring <mark3>sun:</mark3><br>
Such joy, though far transcending <mark3>sense,</mark3><br>
Have pious souls at parting <mark3>hence.</mark3><br>
On earth, and in the body <mark4>placed,</mark4><br>
A few, and evil, years they <mark3>waste;</mark3><br>
But when their chains are cast <mark4>aside,</mark4><br>
See the glad scene unfolding <mark3>wide,</mark3><br>
Clap the glad wing, and tow'r <mark1>away,</mark1><br>
And mingle with the blaze of <mark3>day."</mark3><br>
