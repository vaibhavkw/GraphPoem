Title : Celebration for June 24<br>
Author : Thomas McGrath<br><br>

For <mark4>Marian</mark4><br>
Before you, I was living on an <mark4>island</mark4><br>
And all around the seas of that lonely <mark4>coast</mark4><br>
Cast up their imitation jewels, <mark4>cast</mark4><br>
Their fables and enigmas, questioning, sly. <br>
I never solved them, or ever even <mark4>heard,</mark4><br>
Being perfect in innocence: unconscious of self; <br>
Such ignorance of history was all my <mark4>wealth--</mark4><br>
A geographer sleeping in the shadow of <mark4>virgins.</mark4><br>
<br>
But though my maps were made of private <mark4>countries</mark4><br>
I was a foreigner in all of them after you had <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
For when you spoke, it was with a human <mark4>tongue</mark4><br>
And never understood by my land-locked gentry. <br>
Then did the sun shake down a million <mark4>bells</mark4><br>
And birds bloom on bough in wildest <mark4>song!</mark4><br>
Phlegmatic hills went shivering with <mark4>flame;</mark4><br>
The chestnut trees were manic at their deepest <mark4>boles!</mark4><br>
<br>
It is little strange that nature was riven in her <mark3>frame</mark3><br>
At this second creation, known to every <mark4>lover--</mark4><br>
How we are shaped and shape ourselves in the desires of the <mark4>other</mark4><br>
Within the tolerance of human change. <br>
Out of the spring's innocence this <mark4>revolution,</mark4><br>
Created on a kiss, announced the second <mark4>season,</mark4><br>
The summer of private history, of growth, through whose sweet <mark4>sessions</mark4><br>
The trees lift toward the <mark4>sun</mark4>, each leaf a <mark4>revelation.</mark4><br>
<br>
Our bodies, coupled in the moonlight's <mark4>album,</mark4><br>
Proclaimed our love against the outlaw <mark4>times</mark4><br>
Whose signature was written in the burning <mark4>towns.</mark4><br>
Your face against the night was my <mark4>medallion.</mark4><br>
Your coming forth aroused unlikely <mark4>trumpets</mark4><br>
In the once-tame heart. They heralded your <mark4>worth</mark4><br>
Who are my lodestar, my bright and ultimate <mark4>North,</mark4><br>
Marrying all points of my personal <mark4>compass.</mark4><br>
<br>
This is the love that now invents my fear <br>
Which nuzzles me like a puppy each violent day. <br>
It is poor comfort that the mind comes, <mark4>saying:</mark4><br>
What is one slim girl to the peoples' <mark4>wars?</mark4><br>
Still, my dice are loaded: having had such luck, <br>
Having your love, my life would still be <mark4>whole</mark4><br>
Though I should die tomorrow. I have lived it <mark4>all.</mark4><br>
--And love is never love, that cannot give love up.<br>
