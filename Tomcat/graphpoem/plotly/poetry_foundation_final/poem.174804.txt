Title : Ode to Duty <br>
Author : William Wordsworth <br><br>

Jam non consilio bonus, sed more eo perductus, ut non tantum recte facere possim, sed nisi recte facere non possim"  "I am no longer good through deliberate intent, but by long habit have reached a point where I am not only able to do right, but am unable to do anything but what is right."  (Seneca, Letters 120.10)<br>
Stern Daughter of the Voice of <mark3>God!</mark3><br>
O Duty! if that name thou <mark4>love</mark4><br>
Who art a light to <mark4>guide</mark4>, a <mark3>rod</mark3><br>
To check the erring, and reprove; <br>
Thou, who art victory and law <br>
When empty terrors overawe; <br>
From vain temptations dost set <mark3>free;</mark3><br>
And calm'st the weary strife of frail <mark4>humanity!</mark4><br>
<br>
There are who ask not if thine <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
Be on them; who, in love and <mark3>truth,</mark3><br>
Where no misgiving is, <mark3>rely</mark3><br>
Upon the genial sense of <mark3>youth:</mark3><br>
Glad Hearts! without reproach or <mark3>blot;</mark3><br>
Who do thy work, and know it <mark3>not:</mark3><br>
Oh! if through confidence <mark4>misplaced</mark4><br>
They fail, thy saving arms, dread Power! around them <mark4>cast.</mark4><br>
<br>
Serene will be our days and <mark4>bright,</mark4><br>
And happy will our nature <mark4>be,</mark4><br>
When love is an unerring <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
And joy its own <mark4>security.</mark4><br>
And they a blissful course may <mark4>hold</mark4><br>
Even now, who, not unwisely <mark3>bold,</mark3><br>
Live in the spirit of this <mark4>creed;</mark4><br>
Yet seek thy firm support, according to their <mark3>need.</mark3><br>
<br>
I, loving freedom, and <mark4>untried;</mark4><br>
No sport of every random <mark4>gust,</mark4><br>
Yet being to myself a <mark3>guide,</mark3><br>
Too blindly have reposed my <mark3>trust:</mark3><br>
And oft, when in my heart was <mark4>heard</mark4><br>
Thy timely mandate, I <mark3>deferred</mark3><br>
The task, in smoother walks to <mark3>stray;</mark3><br>
But thee I now would serve more strictly, if I <mark3>may.</mark3><br>
<br>
Through no disturbance of my <mark3>soul,</mark3><br>
Or strong compunction in me <mark4>wrought,</mark4><br>
I supplicate for thy <mark3>control;</mark3><br>
But in the quietness of <mark3>thought:</mark3><br>
Me this unchartered freedom <mark3>tires;</mark3><br>
I feel the weight of <mark3>chance-desires:</mark3><br>
My hopes no more must change their <mark3>name,</mark3><br>
I long for a repose that ever is the <mark3>same.</mark3><br>
<br>
Stern Lawgiver! yet thou dost <mark3>wear</mark3><br>
The Godhead's most benignant <mark3>grace;</mark3><br>
Nor know we anything so <mark3>fair</mark3><br>
As is the smile upon thy <mark3>face:</mark3><br>
Flowers laugh before thee on their <mark4>beds</mark4><br>
And fragrance in thy footing <mark3>treads;</mark3><br>
Thou dost preserve the stars from <mark5>wrong;</mark5><br>
And the most ancient heavens, through Thee, are fresh and <mark3>strong.</mark3><br>
<br>
To humbler functions, awful <mark3>Power!</mark3><br>
I call thee: I myself <mark4>commend</mark4><br>
Unto thy guidance from this <mark3>hour;</mark3><br>
Oh, let my weakness have an <mark3>end!</mark3><br>
Give unto me, made lowly <mark4>wise,</mark4><br>
The spirit of <mark4>self-sacrifice;</mark4><br>
The confidence of reason <mark4>give;</mark4><br>
And in the light of truth thy Bondman let me <mark3>live!</mark3><br>
