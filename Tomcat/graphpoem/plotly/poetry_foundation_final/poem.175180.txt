Title : The Berg (A Dream) <br>
Author : Herman Melville <br><br>

I saw a ship of martial <mark4>build</mark4><br>
(Her standards set, her brave apparel <mark4>on)</mark4><br>
Directed as by madness <mark3>mere</mark3><br>
Against a stolid iceberg <mark3>steer,</mark3><br>
Nor budge it, though the infatuate ship went <mark4>down.</mark4><br>
The impact made huge ice-cubes <mark3>fall</mark3><br>
Sullen, in tons that crashed the <mark3>deck;</mark3><br>
But that one avalanche was <mark3>all--</mark3><br>
No other movement save the foundering <mark3>wreck.</mark3><br>
<br>
Along the spurs of ridges <mark4>pale,</mark4><br>
Not any slenderest shaft and <mark3>frail,</mark3><br>
A prism over glass-green gorges <mark4>lone,</mark4><br>
Toppled; or lace of traceries <mark4>fine,</mark4><br>
Nor pendant drops in grot or <mark3>mine</mark3><br>
Were jarred, when the stunned ship went <mark1>down.</mark1><br>
Nor sole the gulls in cloud that <mark4>wheeled</mark4><br>
Circling one snow-flanked peak <mark4>afar,</mark4><br>
But nearer fowl the floes that <mark4>skimmed</mark4><br>
And crystal beaches, felt no <mark3>jar.</mark3><br>
No thrill transmitted stirred the <mark4>lock</mark4><br>
Of jack-straw needle-ice at <mark3>base;</mark3><br>
Towers undermined by waves--the <mark3>block</mark3><br>
Atilt impending--kept their <mark3>place.</mark3><br>
<mark4>Seals</mark4>, dozing sleek on sliddery <mark4>ledges</mark4><br>
Slipt never, when by loftier <mark3>edges</mark3><br>
Through very inertia <mark4>overthrown,</mark4><br>
The impetuous ship in bafflement went <mark1>down.</mark1><br>
<br>
Hard Berg (methought), so cold, so <mark4>vast,</mark4><br>
With mortal damps <mark4>self-overcast;</mark4><br>
Exhaling still thy dankish <mark3>breath--</mark3><br>
Adrift dissolving, bound for <mark3>death;</mark3><br>
Though lumpish thou, a lumbering <mark4>one--</mark4><br>
A lumbering lubbard loitering <mark3>slow,</mark3><br>
Impingers rue thee and go <mark1>down,</mark1><br>
Sounding thy precipice <mark3>below,</mark3><br>
Nor stir the slimy slug that <mark4>sprawls</mark4><br>
Along thy dead indifference of <mark3>walls.</mark3><br>
