Title : The Self Banished <br>
Author : Edmund Waller <br><br>

It is not that I love you <mark4>less</mark4><br>
Than when before your feet I <mark3>lay,</mark3><br>
But to prevent the sad <mark4>increase</mark4><br>
Of hopeless love, I keep <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
<br>
In vain (alas!) for <mark4>everything</mark4><br>
Which I have known belong to <mark3>you,</mark3><br>
Your form does to my fancy <mark4>bring,</mark4><br>
And makes my old wounds bleed <mark3>anew.</mark3><br>
<br>
Who in the spring from the new <mark3>sun</mark3><br>
Already has a fever <mark3>got,</mark3><br>
Too late begins those shafts to <mark3>shun,</mark3><br>
Which Phoebus through his veins has <mark3>shot.</mark3><br>
<br>
Too late he would the pain <mark3>assuage,</mark3><br>
And to thick shadows does <mark3>retire;</mark3><br>
About with him he bears the <mark3>rage,</mark3><br>
And in his tainted blood the <mark3>fire.</mark3><br>
<br>
But vow'd I have, and never <mark4>must</mark4><br>
Your banish'd servant trouble <mark1>you;</mark1><br>
For if I break, you may <mark3>distrust</mark3><br>
The vow I made to love <mark3>you</mark3>, <mark3>too.</mark3><br>
