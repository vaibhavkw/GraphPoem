Title : Rock Pool <br>
Author : Alan R. Shapiro <br><br>

<br>
Water roared everywhere around us, yet from the <mark5>bank</mark5><br>
all we could see of it were quick spumes and <mark4>flashes</mark4><br>
here and there, in among the boulders. Cautiously,   <br>
as if they might awaken, we clambered <mark4>over</mark4><br>
the gigantic slabs and humps, the sun-baked ovals   <br>
lumpy as hammered clay, and saw downstream below <mark4>us</mark4><br>
only the vague shapes of others, almost billowy,   <br>
like magnified amoebas, stretching away to <mark4>even</mark4><br>
vaguer ones beyond them, turning the narrow   <br>
streambed through the valley to a lunar seam. <br>
Easing ourselves down over the massive <mark4>sides</mark4><br>
<br>
(we were hot and tired, eager for the pools below)   <br>
<br>
we could make out older water in the rough <mark4>grain,</mark4><br>
undulating and immobile currents, band swirled on <mark5>band,</mark5><br>
mica-speckled, cloudy, each seeming to move <mark4>off,</mark4><br>
as it faded, through the stone--each one a glacial <mark4>rune,</mark4><br>
each boulder an innumerable pebble in the ice <mark4>sheet's</mark4><br>
tidal suck and drag: two hundred thousand <mark4>years,</mark4><br>
two billion, five, the molten <mark4>core</mark4>, <mark4>spoor</mark4><br>
of gasses in the vast night, at our <mark4>fingertips.</mark4><br>
Then the pool: your clothes shed, with one hand <mark4>braced</mark4><br>
against the rock ledge you had slipped into the hip-high   <br>
rushing water, and were wading out, bent over, reaching   <br>
<br>
like the blind before you for the slippery <mark4>boulder</mark4><br>
<br>
you slid across, pushing against the white <mark4>weight</mark4><br>
of the pouring mist, your skin goose-fleshed, <mark4>speckled</mark4><br>
bright as mica, and then, part mist <mark4>yourself,</mark4><br>
you turned back, smiling, calling though I <mark4>couldn't</mark4><br>
hear you, calling and waving for me to climb <mark4>down</mark4><br>
to where you were, to join you there. And so I <mark4>did.</mark4><br>
