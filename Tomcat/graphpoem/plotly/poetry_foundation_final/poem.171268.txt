Title : Her Kind <br>
Author : Anne Sexton <br><br>

I have gone out, a possessed <mark3>witch,</mark3><br>
haunting the black air, braver at <mark3>night;</mark3><br>
dreaming evil, I have done my <mark3>hitch</mark3><br>
over the plain houses, light by <mark3>light:</mark3><br>
lonely thing, <mark4>twelve-fingered</mark4>, out of <mark4>mind.</mark4><br>
A woman like that is not a woman, <mark3>quite.</mark3><br>
I have been her <mark3>kind.</mark3><br>
<br>
I have found the warm caves in the <mark4>woods,</mark4><br>
filled them with skillets, <mark4>carvings</mark4>, <mark4>shelves,</mark4><br>
closets, silks, innumerable <mark4>goods;</mark4><br>
fixed the suppers for the worms and the <mark4>elves:</mark4><br>
whining, rearranging the disaligned. <br>
A woman like that is <mark4>misunderstood.</mark4><br>
I have been her <mark1>kind.</mark1><br>
<br>
I have ridden in your cart, <mark3>driver,</mark3><br>
waved my nude arms at villages going <mark3>by,</mark3><br>
learning the last bright routes, <mark3>survivor</mark3><br>
where your flames still bite my <mark3>thigh</mark3><br>
and my ribs crack where your wheels <mark3>wind.</mark3><br>
A woman like that is not ashamed to <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
I have been her <mark1>kind.</mark1><br>
