Title : The Ecstasy <br>
Author : John Donne <br><br>

Where, like a pillow on a <mark3>bed</mark3><br>
A pregnant bank swell'd up to <mark3>rest</mark3><br>
The violet's reclining <mark3>head,</mark3><br>
Sat we two, one another's <mark3>best.</mark3><br>
Our hands were firmly <mark4>cemented</mark4><br>
With a fast balm, which thence did <mark3>spring;</mark3><br>
Our eye-beams <mark4>twisted</mark4>, and did <mark4>thread</mark4><br>
Our eyes upon one double <mark3>string;</mark3><br>
So to'intergraft our hands, as <mark4>yet</mark4><br>
Was all the means to make us <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
And pictures in our eyes to <mark3>get</mark3><br>
Was all our <mark4>propagation.</mark4><br>
As 'twixt two equal armies <mark4>fate</mark4><br>
         Suspends uncertain victory, <br>
Our souls (which to advance their <mark3>state</mark3><br>
Were gone out) hung 'twixt her and <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
And whilst our souls negotiate <mark4>there,</mark4><br>
We like sepulchral statues <mark3>lay;</mark3><br>
All day, the same our postures were, <br>
And we said nothing, all the <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
If any, so by love refin'd <br>
That he soul's language <mark4>understood,</mark4><br>
And by good love were grown all <mark4>mind,</mark4><br>
Within convenient distance <mark4>stood,</mark4><br>
He (though he knew not which soul <mark3>spake,</mark3><br>
Because both meant, both spake the <mark3>same)</mark3><br>
Might thence a new concoction <mark3>take</mark3><br>
And part far purer than he <mark3>came.</mark3><br>
This ecstasy doth unperplex, <br>
We said, and tell us what we <mark4>love;</mark4><br>
We see by this it was not <mark4>sex,</mark4><br>
We see we saw not what did <mark4>move;</mark4><br>
But as all several souls <mark4>contain</mark4><br>
Mixture of things, they know not <mark4>what,</mark4><br>
Love these mix'd souls doth mix <mark3>again</mark3><br>
And makes both one, each this and <mark4>that.</mark4><br>
A single violet <mark4>transplant,</mark4><br>
The strength, the colour, and the <mark4>size,</mark4><br>
(All which before was poor and <mark3>scant)</mark3><br>
Redoubles still, and <mark4>multiplies.</mark4><br>
When love with one another <mark3>so</mark3><br>
Interinanimates two <mark4>souls,</mark4><br>
That abler soul, which thence doth <mark3>flow,</mark3><br>
Defects of loneliness <mark3>controls.</mark3><br>
We then, who are this new soul, <mark3>know</mark3><br>
Of what we are compos'd and <mark4>made,</mark4><br>
For th' atomies of which we <mark3>grow</mark3><br>
Are souls, whom no change can <mark3>invade.</mark3><br>
But oh alas, so long, so <mark4>far,</mark4><br>
         Our bodies why do we forbear? <br>
They'are ours, though they'are not we; we <mark3>are</mark3><br>
The intelligences, they the <mark4>spheres.</mark4><br>
We owe them <mark4>thanks</mark4>, because they <mark4>thus</mark4><br>
Did us, to us, at first <mark3>convey,</mark3><br>
Yielded their senses' force to <mark3>us,</mark3><br>
Nor are dross to us, but <mark3>allay.</mark3><br>
On man heaven's influence works not <mark1>so,</mark1><br>
But that it first imprints the <mark4>air;</mark4><br>
So soul into the soul may <mark1>flow,</mark1><br>
Though it to body first <mark3>repair.</mark3><br>
As our blood labors to <mark4>beget</mark4><br>
Spirits, as like souls as it <mark4>can,</mark4><br>
Because such fingers need to <mark4>knit</mark4><br>
That subtle knot which makes us <mark3>man,</mark3><br>
So must pure lovers' souls <mark4>descend</mark4><br>
T' <mark4>affections</mark4>, and to <mark4>faculties,</mark4><br>
Which sense may reach and <mark3>apprehend,</mark3><br>
Else a great prince in prison <mark4>lies.</mark4><br>
To'our bodies turn we then, that <mark1>so</mark1><br>
Weak men on love reveal'd may <mark4>look;</mark4><br>
Love's mysteries in souls do <mark1>grow,</mark1><br>
But yet the body is his <mark3>book.</mark3><br>
And if some lover, such as <mark3>we,</mark3><br>
Have heard this dialogue of <mark1>one,</mark1><br>
Let him still mark us, he shall <mark3>see</mark3><br>
Small change, when we'are to bodies <mark4>gone.</mark4><br>
