Title : The Highwayman <br>
Author : Alfred Noyes <br><br>

PART <mark4>ONE</mark4><br>
<br>
The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty <mark3>trees.</mark3><br>
The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy <mark3>seas.</mark3><br>
The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple <mark4>moor,</mark4><br>
And the highwayman came <mark4>riding--</mark4><br>
<br>
The highwayman came riding, up to the old <mark4>inn-door.</mark4><br>
<br>
He'd a French cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his <mark4>chin,</mark4><br>
A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown <mark3>doe-skin.</mark3><br>
They fitted with never a wrinkle. His boots were up to the <mark3>thigh.</mark3><br>
And he rode with a jewelled <mark3>twinkle,</mark3><br>
His pistol butts <mark3>a-twinkle,</mark3><br>
His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
<br>
Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark <mark5>inn-yard.</mark5><br>
He tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and <mark3>barred.</mark3><br>
He whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting <mark4>there</mark4><br>
But the landlord's black-eyed <mark1>daughter,</mark1><br>
Bess, the landlord's <mark1>daughter,</mark1><br>
Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black <mark3>hair.</mark3><br>
<br>
And dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket <mark3>creaked</mark3><br>
Where Tim the ostler listened. His face was white and <mark3>peaked.</mark3><br>
His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy <mark3>hay,</mark3><br>
But he loved the landlord's <mark1>daughter,</mark1><br>
The landlord's red-lipped <mark1>daughter.</mark1><br>
Dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber <mark3>say--</mark3><br>
<br>
"One kiss, my bonny <mark4>sweetheart</mark4>, I'm after a prize <mark4>to-night,</mark4><br>
But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning <mark3>light;</mark3><br>
Yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
Then look for me by <mark4>moonlight,</mark4><br>
Watch for me by <mark1>moonlight,</mark1><br>
I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the <mark3>way."</mark3><br>
<br>
He rose upright in the stirrups. He scarce could reach her <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
But she loosened her hair in the casement. His face burnt like a <mark3>brand</mark3><br>
As the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his <mark4>breast;</mark4><br>
And he kissed its waves in the <mark1>moonlight,</mark1><br>
(O, sweet black waves in the <mark1>moonlight!)</mark1><br>
Then he tugged at his rein in the <mark4>moonlight</mark4>, and galloped away to the <mark4>west.</mark4><br>
<br>
PART TWO <br>
<br>
He did not come in the dawning. He did not come at <mark4>noon;</mark4><br>
And out of the tawny sunset, before the rise of the <mark3>moon,</mark3><br>
When the road was a gypsy's ribbon, looping the purple <mark1>moor,</mark1><br>
A red-coat troop came <mark4>marching--</mark4><br>
<br>
King George's men came marching, up to the old <mark1>inn-door.</mark1><br>
<br>
They said no word to the <mark4>landlord</mark4>, They drank his ale <mark4>instead.</mark4><br>
But they gagged his daughter, and bound her, to the foot of her narrow <mark3>bed.</mark3><br>
Two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their <mark4>side!</mark4><br>
There was death at every <mark1>window;</mark1><br>
And hell at one dark <mark1>window;</mark1><br>
For Bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would <mark3>ride.</mark3><br>
<br>
They had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering <mark3>jest.</mark3><br>
They had bound a musket beside her, with the muzzle beneath her <mark1>breast!</mark1><br>
"Now, keep good watch!" and they kissed her. She heard the doomed man <mark1>say--</mark1><br>
Look for me by <mark1>moonlight;</mark1><br>
Watch for me by <mark1>moonlight;</mark1><br>
I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the <mark1>way!</mark1><br>
<br>
She twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held <mark4>good!</mark4><br>
She writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or <mark4>blood!</mark4><br>
They stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like <mark4>years</mark4><br>
Till, now, on the stroke of <mark3>midnight,</mark3><br>
Cold, on the stroke of <mark1>midnight,</mark1><br>
The tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was <mark4>hers!</mark4><br>
<br>
The tip of one finger touched <mark4>it</mark4>, She strove no more for the <mark4>rest.</mark4><br>
Up, she stood up to attention, with the muzzle beneath her <mark1>breast.</mark1><br>
She would not risk their hearing; she would not strive <mark4>again;</mark4><br>
For the road lay bare in the <mark1>moonlight;</mark1><br>
Blank and bare in the <mark1>moonlight;</mark1><br>
And the blood of her veins, in the moonlight, throbbed to her love's <mark3>refrain.</mark3><br>
<br>
Tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horsehoofs ringing <mark4>clear;</mark4><br>
Tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot, in the distance? Were they deaf that they did not <mark4>hear?</mark4><br>
Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the <mark4>hill,</mark4><br>
The highwayman came <mark1>riding--</mark1><br>
<br>
The red coats looked to their priming! She stood up, straight and <mark3>still.</mark3><br>
<br>
Tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot, in the echoing <mark4>night!</mark4><br>
Nearer he came and nearer. Her face was like a <mark1>light.</mark1><br>
Her eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep <mark5>breath,</mark5><br>
Then her finger moved in the <mark1>moonlight,</mark1><br>
Her musket shattered the <mark1>moonlight,</mark1><br>
Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him--with her <mark3>death.</mark3><br>
<br>
He turned. He spurred to the west; he did not know who <mark4>stood</mark4><br>
Bowed, with her head o'er the musket, drenched with her own <mark1>blood!</mark1><br>
Not till the dawn he heard it, and his face grew grey to <mark1>hear</mark1><br>
How Bess, the landlord's <mark1>daughter,</mark1><br>
The landlord's black-eyed <mark1>daughter,</mark1><br>
Had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness <mark1>there.</mark1><br>
<br>
Back, he spurred like a madman, shouting a curse to the <mark1>sky,</mark1><br>
With the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished <mark3>high.</mark3><br>
Blood red were his spurs in the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet <mark4>coat;</mark4><br>
When they shot him down on the <mark5>highway,</mark5><br>
Down like a dog on the <mark1>highway,</mark1><br>
And he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his <mark3>throat.</mark3><br>
<br>
.       .       . <br>
<br>
And still of a winter's night, they say, when the wind is in the <mark1>trees,</mark1><br>
When the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy <mark1>seas,</mark1><br>
When the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple <mark1>moor,</mark1><br>
A highwayman comes <mark1>riding--</mark1><br>
<br>
A highwayman comes riding, up to the old <mark1>inn-door.</mark1><br>
<br>
Over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark <mark1>inn-yard.</mark1><br>
He taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and <mark1>barred.</mark1><br>
He whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting <mark1>there</mark1><br>
But the landlord's black-eyed <mark1>daughter,</mark1><br>
Bess, the landlord's <mark1>daughter,</mark1><br>
Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black <mark1>hair.</mark1><br>
