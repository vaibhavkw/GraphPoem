Title : Walking on Tiptoe <br>
Author : Ted Kooser <br><br>

Long ago we quit lifting our <mark4>heels</mark4><br>
like the others--horse, dog, and tiger-- <br>
though we thrill to their <mark4>speed</mark4><br>
as they flee. Even the <mark4>mouse</mark4><br>
bearing the great weight of a <mark4>nugget</mark4><br>
of dog food is enviably graceful. <br>
There is little spring to our <mark4>walk,</mark4><br>
we are so burdened with responsibility,   <br>
all of the disciplinary <mark4>actions</mark4><br>
that have fallen to <mark4>us</mark4>, the <mark4>punishments,</mark4><br>
the killings, and all with our <mark4>feet</mark4><br>
bound stiff in the skins of the <mark4>conquered.</mark4><br>
But <mark4>sometimes</mark4>, in the early <mark4>hours,</mark4><br>
we can feel what it must have been <mark4>like</mark4><br>
to be one of them, up on our <mark4>toes,</mark4><br>
stealing past doors where others are sleeping,   <br>
and suddenly able to see in the <mark4>dark.</mark4><br>
