Title : Contentment <br>
Author : Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. <br><br>

"Man wants but little here <mark3>below"</mark3><br>
Little I ask; my wants are <mark3>few;</mark3><br>
I only wish a hut of <mark3>stone,</mark3><br>
(A very plain brown stone will <mark3>do,)</mark3><br>
That I may call my <mark3>own;--</mark3><br>
And close at hand is such a <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
In yonder street that fronts the <mark3>sun.</mark3><br>
<br>
Plain food is quite enough for <mark3>me;</mark3><br>
Three courses are as good as <mark4>ten;--</mark4><br>
If Nature can subsist on <mark3>three,</mark3><br>
Thank Heaven for three. <mark3>Amen!</mark3><br>
I always thought cold victual <mark3>nice;--</mark3><br>
My choice would be <mark3>vanilla-ice.</mark3><br>
<br>
I care not much for gold or <mark3>land;--</mark3><br>
Give me a mortgage here and <mark3>there,--</mark3><br>
Some good bank-stock, some note of <mark3>hand,</mark3><br>
Or trifling railroad <mark3>share,--</mark3><br>
I only ask that Fortune <mark4>send</mark4><br>
A little more than I shall <mark3>spend.</mark3><br>
<br>
Honors are silly toys, I <mark3>know,</mark3><br>
And titles are but empty <mark3>names;</mark3><br>
I would, perhaps, be Plenipo,--<br>
But only near St. <mark3>James;</mark3><br>
I'm very sure I should not <mark3>care</mark3><br>
To fill our Gubernator's <mark3>chair.</mark3><br>
<br>
Jewels are baubles; 't is a <mark4>sin</mark4><br>
To care for such unfruitful <mark4>things;--</mark4><br>
One good-sized diamond in a <mark3>pin,--</mark3><br>
Some, not so large, in <mark3>rings,--</mark3><br>
A ruby, and a pearl, or <mark3>so,</mark3><br>
Will do for me;--I laugh at <mark3>show.</mark3><br>
<br>
My dame should dress in cheap <mark3>attire;</mark3><br>
(Good, heavy silks are never <mark4>dear;)--</mark4><br>
I own perhaps I might <mark3>desire</mark3><br>
Some shawls of true <mark4>Cashmere,--</mark4><br>
Some marrowy crapes of China <mark3>silk,</mark3><br>
Like wrinkled skins on scalded <mark3>milk.</mark3><br>
<br>
I would not have the horse I <mark4>drive</mark4><br>
So fast that folks must stop and <mark4>stare;</mark4><br>
An easy gait--two <mark4>forty-five--</mark4><br>
Suits me; I do not <mark1>care;--</mark1><br>
Perhaps, for just a single <mark3>spurt,</mark3><br>
Some seconds less would do no <mark3>hurt.</mark3><br>
<br>
Of pictures, I should like to <mark1>own</mark1><br>
Titians and Raphaels three or <mark4>four,--</mark4><br>
I love so much their style and <mark3>tone,</mark3><br>
One Turner, and no <mark3>more,</mark3><br>
(A landscape,--foreground golden <mark3>dirt,--</mark3><br>
The sunshine painted with a <mark3>squirt.)</mark3><br>
<br>
Of books but few,--some fifty <mark3>score</mark3><br>
For daily use, and bound for <mark4>wear;</mark4><br>
The rest upon an upper <mark4>floor;--</mark4><br>
Some little luxury <mark1>there</mark1><br>
Of red morocco's gilded <mark3>gleam</mark3><br>
And vellum rich as country <mark3>cream.</mark3><br>
<br>
Busts, cameos, gems,--such things as <mark4>these,</mark4><br>
Which others often show for <mark4>pride,</mark4><br>
I value for their power to <mark3>please,</mark3><br>
And selfish churls <mark3>deride;--</mark3><br>
One <mark4>Stradivarius</mark4>, I <mark4>confess,</mark4><br>
Two Meerschaums, I would fain <mark3>possess.</mark3><br>
<br>
Wealth's wasteful tricks I will not <mark4>learn,</mark4><br>
Nor ape the glittering upstart <mark3>fool;--</mark3><br>
Shall not carved tables serve my <mark3>turn,</mark3><br>
But all must be of <mark3>buhl?</mark3><br>
Give grasping pomp its double <mark1>share,--</mark1><br>
I ask but one recumbent <mark1>chair.</mark1><br>
<br>
Thus humble let me live and <mark3>die,</mark3><br>
Nor long for Midas' golden <mark3>touch;</mark3><br>
If Heaven more generous gifts <mark3>deny,</mark3><br>
I shall not miss them <mark3>much,--</mark3><br>
Too grateful for the blessing <mark4>lent</mark4><br>
Of simple tastes and mind <mark3>content!</mark3><br>
