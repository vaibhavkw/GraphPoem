Author : James Whitcomb Riley <br><br>

It hain't no use to grumble and <mark5>complane;</mark5><br>
It's jest as cheap and easy to <mark3>rejoice.?</mark3><br>
When God sorts out the weather and sends <mark4>rain,</mark4><br>
W'y rain's my <mark3>choice.</mark3><br>
<br>
Men ginerly, to all <mark4>intents?</mark4><br>
Although they're apt to grumble <mark3>some?</mark3><br>
Puts most theyr trust in <mark4>Providence,</mark4><br>
And takes things as they <mark3>come?</mark3><br>
That is, the <mark5>commonality</mark5><br>
Of men that's lived as long as <mark3>me</mark3><br>
Has watched the world enugh to <mark4>learn</mark4><br>
They're not the boss of this <mark3>concern.</mark3><br>
<br>
With some, of course, it's <mark4>different?</mark4><br>
I've saw young men that knowed it <mark3>all,</mark3><br>
And didn't like the way things <mark4>went</mark4><br>
On this terrestchul <mark3>ball;?</mark3><br>
But all the same, the rain, some <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
Rained jest as hard on picnic <mark3>day;</mark3><br>
Er, when they railly wanted <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
It mayby wouldn't rain a <mark3>bit!</mark3><br>
<br>
In this existunce, dry and <mark4>wet</mark4><br>
Will overtake the best of <mark4>men?</mark4><br>
Some little skift o' clouds'll shet<br>
The sun off now and <mark3>then.?</mark3><br>
And mayby, whilse you're wundern <mark3>who</mark3><br>
You've fool-like lent your umbrell' <mark3>to,</mark3><br>
And want it?out'll pop the <mark4>sun,</mark4><br>
And you'll be glad you hain't got <mark3>none!</mark3><br>
<br>
It aggervates the farmers, <mark2>too?</mark2><br>
They's too much wet, er too much <mark1>sun,</mark1><br>
Er work, er waitin' round to <mark3>do</mark3><br>
Before the plowin' 's <mark3>done:</mark3><br>
And mayby, like as <mark4>not</mark4>, the <mark4>wheat,</mark4><br>
Jest as it's lookin' hard to <mark3>beat,</mark3><br>
Will ketch the storm?and jest <mark4>about</mark4><br>
The time the corn's a-jintin' <mark3>out.</mark3><br>
<br>
These-here cy-clones a-foolin' round?<br>
And back'ard crops!?and wind and <mark1>rain!?</mark1><br>
And yit the corn that's wallerd <mark4>down</mark4><br>
May elbow up <mark4>again!?</mark4><br>
They hain't no sense, as I can <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
Fer mortuls, sech as us, to <mark3>be</mark3><br>
A-faultin' Natchur's wise <mark1>intents,</mark1><br>
And lockin' horns with <mark1>Providence!</mark1><br>
<br>
It hain't no use to grumble and <mark1>complane;</mark1><br>
It's jest as cheap and easy to <mark1>rejoice.?</mark1><br>
When God sorts out the weather and sends <mark1>rain,</mark1><br>
W'y, rain's my <mark1>choice.</mark1><br>
