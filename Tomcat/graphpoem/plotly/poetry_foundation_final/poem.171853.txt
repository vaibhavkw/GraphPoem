Title : The Illiterate <br>
Author : William Meredith <br><br>

Touching your goodness, I am like a <mark1>man</mark1><br>
Who turns a letter over in his <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
And you might think this was because the <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
Was unfamiliar but, truth is, the <mark1>man</mark1><br>
Has never had a letter from <mark4>anyone;</mark4><br>
And now he is both afraid of what it <mark1>means</mark1><br>
And ashamed because he has no other <mark1>means</mark1><br>
To find out what it says than to ask <mark3>someone.</mark3><br>
<br>
His uncle could have left the farm to <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
Or his parents died before he sent them <mark4>word,</mark4><br>
Or the dark girl changed and want him for <mark4>beloved.</mark4><br>
Afraid and letter-proud, he keeps it with <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
What would you call his feeling for the <mark4>words</mark4><br>
That keep him rich and orphaned and <mark1>beloved?</mark1><br>
