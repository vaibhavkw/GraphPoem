Title : Height Is the Distance Down<br>
Author : Mary Barnard<br><br>

What's geography? What difference what <mark4>mountain</mark4><br>
it is? In the intimacy of this <mark4>altitude</mark4><br>
its discolored snowfields overhang half the <mark4>world.</mark4><br>
<br>
On a knife rim edge-up into whirlpools of sky,   <br>
feet are no anchor. Gravity sucks at the <mark4>mind</mark4><br>
spinning the blood-weighted body head <mark4>downward.</mark4><br>
<br>
The mountain that had become a known profile   <br>
on the day's horizon is a gesture of <mark4>earth</mark4><br>
swinging us above falling spaces, above   <br>
a map of the world. Disturber of the <mark4>unseen,</mark4><br>
provoker of the gusts in which we <mark4>bend</mark4><br>
struggling against destruction gaping <mark4>eastward.</mark4><br>
The wind fails. The breath held. The illusion of <mark4>death.</mark4><br>
The resisting shoulder unopposed lurches   <br>
west in innocent still air, as <mark3>steep</mark3>, as <mark3>deep.</mark3><br>
