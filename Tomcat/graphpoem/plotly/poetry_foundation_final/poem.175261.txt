Title : Will and Testament <br>
Author : Isabella Whitney <br><br>

The time is come I must <mark1>departe</mark1><br>
        from thee, ah, famous Citie:<br>
I never <mark4>yet</mark4>, to rue my <mark4>smart,</mark4><br>
        did finde that thou hadst pitie,<br>
Wherefore small cause ther is, that <mark3>I</mark3><br>
should greeve from thee to <mark3>go:</mark3><br>
But many Women foolyshly,<br>
lyke me, and other <mark3>moe.</mark3><br>
Doe such a fyxed fancy <mark4>set,</mark4><br>
on those which least <mark5>desarve,</mark5><br>
That long it is ere wit we <mark3>get,</mark3><br>
        away from them to swarve,<br>
But tyme with pittie oft wyl <mark3>tel</mark3><br>
to those that wil her <mark3>try:</mark3><br>
Whether it best be more to <mark3>mell,</mark3><br>
        or vtterly defye.<br>
And now hath time me put in <mark4>mind,</mark4><br>
        of thy great cruelnes:<br>
That never once a help wold <mark1>finde,</mark1><br>
        to ease me in distres.<br>
Thou never yet woldst credit <mark1>geve</mark1><br>
        to boord me for a yeare:<br>
Nor with Apparell me releve<br>
except thou payed <mark5>weare.</mark5><br>
No, no, thou never didst me <mark4>good,</mark4><br>
nor ever wilt, I <mark3>know:</mark3><br>
Yet am I in no angry moode,<br>
but wyll, or ere I <mark3>goe,</mark3><br>
In perfect love and <mark5>charytie</mark5><br>
my Testament here <mark4>write:</mark4><br>
And leave to thee such Treasurye,<br>
        as I in it recyte.<br>
Now stand a side and geve me <mark4>leave</mark4><br>
to write my latest <mark1>Wyll:</mark1><br>
And see that none you do <mark1>deceave,</mark1><br>
        of that I leave them tyl.<br>
<br>
I whole in body, and in <mark5>minde,</mark5><br>
but very weake in <mark4>Purse:</mark4><br>
Doo make, and write my <mark4>Testament</mark4><br>
        for feare it wyll be wurse.<br>
And fyrst I wholy doo <mark4>commend,</mark4><br>
my Soule and Body <mark3>eke:</mark3><br>
To God the Father and the <mark4>Son,</mark4><br>
so long as I can <mark3>speake.</mark3><br>
And after speach: my Soule to hym,<br>
and Body to the <mark4>Grave:</mark4><br>
Tyll time that all shall rise agayne,<br>
their Judgement for to <mark4>have.</mark4><br>
And then I hope they both shal <mark1>meete.</mark1><br>
        to dwell for aye in ioye:<br>
Whereas I trust to see my <mark4>Friends</mark4><br>
releast, from all <mark3>annoy.</mark3><br>
Thus have you heard touching my <mark4>soule,</mark4><br>
        and body what I meane:<br>
I trust you all wyll witnes <mark4>beare,</mark4><br>
        I have a stedfast brayne.<br>
<br>
And now let mee dispose such <mark4>things,</mark4><br>
as I shal leave <mark5>behinde:</mark5><br>
That those which shall receave the <mark4>same,</mark4><br>
may know my wylling <mark1>minde.</mark1><br>
I firste of all to London <mark1>leave</mark1><br>
because I there was <mark4>bred:</mark4><br>
Braue buildyngs <mark4>rare</mark4>, of Churches <mark4>store,</mark4><br>
and Pauls to the <mark3>head.</mark3><br>
Betweene the same: fayre streats there <mark1>bee,</mark1><br>

Because their keeping craveth <mark4>cost,</mark4><br>

And such as orders doo obserue,<br>

And Linnen store in Friday <mark1>streete,</mark1><br>
if they mee not <mark1>deceave.</mark1><br>
And those which are of callyng <mark4>such,</mark4><br>
that costlier they <mark4>require:</mark4><br>
I Mercers leave, with silke so <mark4>rich,</mark4><br>
as any would <mark5>desyre.</mark5><br>
In Cheape of them, they store shal <mark1>finde</mark1><br>
and likewise in that <mark1>streete:</mark1><br>

And Plate to furnysh Cubbards <mark5>with,</mark5><br>

With Hoods, Bungraces, Hats or <mark4>Caps,</mark4><br>

As if on ton side you should misse<br>

For Nets of every kynd of <mark4>sort,</mark4><br>
        I leave within the pawne:<br>
French Ruffes, high Purles, Gorgets and <mark4>Sleeves</mark4><br>
        of any kind of Lawne.<br>
For Purse or Kniues, for Combe or Glasse,<br>

For Women stitchte, for men both <mark4>Trunks</mark4><br>

Bootes, Shoes or Pantables good <mark1>store,</mark1><br>
        Saint Martins hath for you:<br>
In Cornwall, there I leave you <mark4>Beds,</mark4><br>
and all that longs <mark5>thereto.</mark5><br>
For Women shall you Taylors <mark1>have,</mark1><br>
by Bow, the chiefest <mark5>dwel:</mark5><br>
In every Lane you some shall <mark1>finde,</mark1><br>
can doo indifferent <mark4>well.</mark4><br>
And for the men, few Streetes or <mark4>Lanes,</mark4><br>
but Bodymakers <mark1>bee:</mark1><br>
And such as make the sweeping Cloakes,<br>
with Gardes beneth the <mark3>Knee.</mark3><br>
Artyllery at Temple <mark4>Bar,</mark4><br>
        and Dagges at Tower hyll:<br>
Swords and Bucklers of the <mark4>best,</mark4><br>
        are nye the Fleete vntyll.<br>
Now when thy Folke are fed and <mark4>clad</mark4><br>
with such as I have <mark5>namde:</mark5><br>
For daynty mouthes, and stomacks <mark5>weake</mark5><br>
        some Iunckets must be framde.<br>
Wherfore I Poticaries <mark1>leave,</mark1><br>
with Banquets in their <mark3>Shop:</mark3><br>
Phisicians also for the sicke,<br>
Diseases for to <mark3>stop.</mark3><br>
Some Roysters styll, must bide in <mark3>thee,</mark3><br>
and such as cut it <mark4>out:</mark4><br>
That with the guiltlesse quarel <mark5>wyl,</mark5><br>
to let their blood <mark3>about.</mark3><br>
For them I cunning Surgions <mark1>leave,</mark1><br>
some Playsters to <mark3>apply.</mark3><br>
That Ruffians may not styll be <mark5>hangde,</mark5><br>
nor quiet persons <mark3>dye.</mark3><br>
For Salt, Otemeale, Candles, <mark4>Sope,</mark4><br>
or what you els doo <mark4>want:</mark4><br>
In many places, Shops are <mark4>full,</mark4><br>
I left you nothing <mark4>scant.</mark4><br>
Yf they that keepe what I you <mark1>leave,</mark1><br>
aske Mony: when they sell <mark4>it:</mark4><br>
At Mint, there is such store, it <mark4>is</mark4><br>
vnpossible to tell <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
At Stiliarde store of Wines there <mark1>bee,</mark1><br>
your dulled mindes to <mark3>glad:</mark3><br>
And handsome men, that must not <mark4>wed</mark4><br>
except they leave their <mark4>trade.</mark4><br>
They oft shal seeke for proper Gyrles,<br>
        and some perhaps shall fynde:<br>
(That neede <mark4>compels</mark4>, or lucre <mark4>lures</mark4><br>
to satisfye their <mark1>mind.)</mark1><br>
And neare the same, I houses <mark1>leave,</mark1><br>
for people to <mark5>repayre:</mark5><br>
To bathe themselues, so to <mark5>preuent</mark5><br>
infection of the <mark4>ayre.</mark4><br>
On Saturdayes I wish that <mark4>those,</mark4><br>
which all the weeke doo <mark3>drug:</mark3><br>
Shall thyther trudge, to trim them <mark3>vp</mark3><br>
on Sondayes to looke <mark3>smug.</mark3><br>
Yf any other thing be <mark5>lackt</mark5><br>
        in thee, I wysh them looke:<br>
For there it is: I little <mark4>brought</mark4><br>
but nothyng from thee <mark4>tooke.</mark4><br>
Now for the people in thee <mark4>left,</mark4><br>
I have done as I <mark3>may:</mark3><br>
And that the poore, when I am <mark4>gone,</mark4><br>
have cause for me to <mark3>pray.</mark3><br>
I wyll to prisons portions <mark1>leave,</mark1><br>
what though but very <mark4>small:</mark4><br>
Yet that they may remember <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
occasion be it <mark4>shall:</mark4><br>
And fyrst the Counter they shal <mark1>have,</mark1><br>
least they should go to <mark4>wrack:</mark4><br>
Some Coggers, and some honest <mark4>men,</mark4><br>
that Sergantes draw a <mark3>back.</mark3><br>
And such as Friends wyl not them <mark4>bayle,</mark4><br>
whose coyne is very <mark4>thin:</mark4><br>
For them I leave a certayne <mark4>hole,</mark4><br>
and little ease <mark3>within.</mark3><br>
The Newgate once a Monthe shal <mark1>have</mark1><br>
a sessions for his <mark3>share:</mark3><br>
Least being heapt, Infection <mark4>might</mark4><br>
procure a further <mark3>care.</mark3><br>
And at those sessions some shal skape,<br>
with burning nere the <mark4>Thumb:</mark4><br>
And afterward to beg their <mark4>fees,</mark4><br>
tyll they have got the <mark3>some.</mark3><br>
And such whose deedes deserueth <mark4>death,</mark4><br>
and twelue have found the <mark1>same:</mark1><br>
They shall be drawne vp Holborne <mark4>hill,</mark4><br>
to come to further <mark3>shame:</mark3><br>
Well, yet to such I leave a <mark4>Nag</mark4><br>
shal soone their sorowes <mark4>cease:</mark4><br>
For he shal either breake their <mark4>necks</mark4><br>
or gallop from the <mark5>preace.</mark5><br>
The Fleete, not in their circuit <mark1>is,</mark1><br>
        yet if I geve him nought:<br>
It might procure his curse, ere <mark1>I</mark1><br>
unto the ground be <mark1>brought.</mark1><br>
Wherfore I leave some Papist <mark4>olde</mark4><br>
to vnder prop his <mark5>roofe:</mark5><br>
And to the poore within the <mark1>same,</mark1><br>
a Boxe for their <mark5>behoofe.</mark5><br>
What makes you standers by to <mark4>smile.</mark4><br>
and laugh so in your <mark4>sleeve:</mark4><br>
I thinke it is, because that <mark1>I</mark1><br>
to Ludgate nothing <mark1>geve.</mark1><br>
I am not now in case to <mark3>lye,</mark3><br>
        here is no place of iest:<br>
I dyd reserve, that for my selfe,<br>
        yf I my health possest.<br>
And ever came in credit <mark3>so</mark3><br>
a debtor for to <mark1>bee.</mark1><br>
When dayes of paiment did <mark5>approch,</mark5><br>
I thither ment to <mark3>flee.</mark3><br>
To shroude my selfe amongst the <mark4>rest,</mark4><br>
that chuse to dye in <mark4>debt:</mark4><br>
Rather then any <mark4>Creditor,</mark4><br>
should money from them <mark1>get.</mark1><br>
Yet cause I feele my selfe so <mark1>weake</mark1><br>
that none mee credit <mark3>dare:</mark3><br>
I heere reuoke: and doo it <mark1>leave,</mark1><br>
some Banckrupts to his <mark1>share.</mark1><br>
To all the Bookebinders by Paulles<br>
        because I lyke their Arte:<br>
They e'ry weeke shal mony <mark1>have,</mark1><br>
when they from Bookes <mark1>departe.</mark1><br>
Amongst them all, my Printer <mark4>must,</mark4><br>
have somwhat to his <mark1>share:</mark1><br>
I wyll my Friends these Bookes to <mark3>bye</mark3><br>
of him, with other <mark3>ware.</mark3><br>
For Maydens poore, I Widdoers <mark4>ritch,</mark4><br>
do leave, that oft shall <mark4>dote:</mark4><br>
And by that meanes shal mary <mark4>them,</mark4><br>
        to set the Girles aflote.<br>
And wealthy Widdowes wil I <mark1>leave,</mark1><br>
        to help yong Gentylmen:<br>
Which when you have, in any <mark4>case</mark4><br>
be courteous to them <mark4>then:</mark4><br>
And see their Plate and Iewells eake<br>
may not be mard with <mark4>rust.</mark4><br>
Nor let their Bags too long be <mark1>full,</mark1><br>
for feare that they doo <mark4>burst.</mark4><br>
To e'ry Gate vnder the <mark4>walles,</mark4><br>
that compas thee <mark1>about:</mark1><br>
I Fruit wives leave to entertayne<br>
such as come in and <mark1>out.</mark1><br>
To Smithfeelde I must something <mark1>leave</mark1><br>
my Parents there did <mark4>dwell:</mark4><br>
So carelesse for to be of <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
none wolde accompt it <mark1>well.</mark1><br>
Wherfore it thrice a weeke shall <mark1>have,</mark1><br>
of Horse and neat good <mark1>store,</mark1><br>
And in his Spitle, blynd and <mark4>lame,</mark4><br>
to dwell for <mark4>evermore.</mark4><br>
And Bedlem must not be <mark4>forgot,</mark4><br>
for that was oft my <mark4>walke:</mark4><br>
I people there too many <mark1>leave,</mark1><br>
        that out of tune doo talke.<br>
At Bridewel there shal Bedelles <mark3>be,</mark3><br>
        and Matrones that shal styll<br>
See Chalke wel chopt, and spinning plyde,<br>
and turning of the <mark4>Mill.</mark4><br>
For such as cannot quiet <mark1>bee,</mark1><br>
but striue for House or <mark4>Land:</mark4><br>
At Th' innes of Court, I Lawyers <mark1>leave</mark1><br>
to take their cause in <mark3>hand.</mark3><br>
And also leave I at ech Inne<br>
        of Court, or Chauncerye:<br>
Of Gentylmen, a youthfull <mark5>roote,</mark5><br>
        full of Actiuytie:<br>
For whom I store of Bookes have <mark1>left,</mark1><br>
at each Bookebinders <mark4>stall:</mark4><br>
And parte of all that London <mark4>hath</mark4><br>
to furnish them <mark5>withall.</mark5><br>
And when they are with study <mark4>cloyd:</mark4><br>
to recreate theyr <mark1>minde:</mark1><br>
Of Tennis Courts, of dauncing Scooles,<br>
and fence they store shal <mark1>finde.</mark1><br>
And every Sonday at the <mark4>least,</mark4><br>
I leave to make them <mark4>sport.</mark4><br>
In diuers places Players, <mark4>that</mark4><br>
of wonders shall <mark5>reporte.</mark5><br>
Now London have I (for thy <mark4>sake)</mark4><br>
within thee, and <mark4>without:</mark4><br>
As coms into my <mark4>memory,</mark4><br>
dispearsed round <mark1>about</mark1><br>
Such needfull thinges, as they should <mark1>have</mark1><br>
heere left now unto <mark1>thee:</mark1><br>
When I am gon, with consience,<br>
let them dispearced <mark1>bee.</mark1><br>
And though I nothing named <mark1>have,</mark1><br>
to bury mee <mark1>withall:</mark1><br>
Consider that aboue the <mark4>ground,</mark4><br>
annoyance bee I <mark1>shall.</mark1><br>
And let me have a shrowding Sheete<br>
to couer mee from <mark1>shame:</mark1><br>
And in obliuyon bury <mark3>mee</mark3><br>
and never more mee <mark3>name.</mark3><br>
Ringings nor other <mark4>Ceremonies,</mark4><br>
vse you not for <mark1>cost:</mark1><br>
Nor at my buriall, make no <mark4>feast,</mark4><br>
your mony were but <mark4>lost.</mark4><br>
Reioyce in God that I am <mark5>gon,</mark5><br>
out of this vale so <mark4>vile.</mark4><br>
And that of ech thing, left such <mark1>store,</mark1><br>
as may your wants <mark4>exile.</mark4><br>
I make thee sole executor, <mark4>because</mark4><br>
I lou'de thee <mark1>best.</mark1><br>
And thee I put in trust, to <mark1>geve</mark1><br>
the goodes unto the <mark1>rest.</mark1><br>
Because thou shalt a helper neede,<br>
In this so great a <mark5>chardge,</mark5><br>
I wysh good Fortune, be thy guide, <mark1>least</mark1><br>
        thou shouldst run at lardge.<br>
The happy dayes and quiet <mark4>times,</mark4><br>
they both her Seruants <mark1>bee.</mark1><br>
Which well wyll serue to fetch and bring,<br>
such things as neede to <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
<br>
Wherfore (good London) not <mark4>refuse,</mark4><br>
for helper her to <mark3>take:</mark3><br>
Thus being weake and wery <mark4>both</mark4><br>
an end heere wyll I <mark3>make.</mark3><br>
To all that aske what end I <mark4>made,</mark4><br>
and how I went <mark3>away:</mark3><br>
Thou answer maist like those which heere,<br>
no longer tary <mark1>may.</mark1><br>
And unto all that wysh mee <mark1>well,</mark1><br>
or rue that I am <mark1>gon:</mark1><br>
Doo me comend, and bid them <mark1>cease</mark1><br>
my absence for to <mark4>mone.</mark4><br>
And tell them further, if they wolde,<br>
my presence styll have <mark4>had:</mark4><br>
They should have sought to mend my <mark4>luck;</mark4><br>
which ever was too <mark3>bad.</mark3><br>
So fare thou well a thousand <mark1>times,</mark1><br>
God sheelde thee from thy <mark3>foe:</mark3><br>
And styll make thee <mark4>victorious,</mark4><br>
of those that seeke thy <mark3>woe.</mark3><br>
And (though I am perswade) that <mark1>I</mark1><br>
shall never more thee <mark3>see:</mark3><br>
Yet to the last, I shal not <mark1>cease</mark1><br>
to wish much good to <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
This, xx. of October <mark1>I,</mark1><br>
in ANNO <mark4>DOMINI:</mark4><br>
A Thousand: <mark3>v</mark3>, hundred seuenty <mark3>three</mark3><br>
as Alminacks <mark5>descry.</mark5><br>
Did write this Wyll with mine owne <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
        and it to London gaue:<br>
In witnes of the standers <mark3>by,</mark3><br>
whose names yf you wyll <mark1>have.</mark1><br>
Paper, Pen and Standish were:<br>
at that same present <mark1>by:</mark1><br>
With Time, who promised to reveale,<br>
        so fast as she could hye<br>
The same: least of my nearer kyn,<br>
for any thing should <mark4>vary:</mark4><br>
So finally I make an <mark4>end</mark4><br>
        no longer can I tary.<br>
