Title : The Negro Speaks of Rivers <br>
Author : Langston Hughes <br><br>

I've known <mark4>rivers:</mark4><br>
I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human <mark4>veins.</mark4><br>
<br>
My soul has grown deep like the <mark1>rivers.</mark1><br>
<br>
I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young. <br>
I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep. <br>
I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went down to New Orleans, and I've seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the <mark4>sunset.</mark4><br>
<br>
I've known <mark1>rivers:</mark1><br>
Ancient, dusky <mark1>rivers.</mark1><br>
<br>
My soul has grown deep like the <mark1>rivers.</mark1><br>
