Title : Self-Portrait <br>
Author : Chase Twichell <br><br>

I know I promised to stop <br>
talking about <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
but I was talking to myself. <br>
The truth is, she's a child <br>
who stopped growing, <br>
so I've always allowed <mark1>her</mark1><br>
to tag along, and when she <mark4>brings</mark4><br>
her melancholy close to me <br>
I comfort her. Naturally <br>
you're curious; you want to <mark1>know</mark1><br>
how she became a gnarled branch <br>
veiled in diminutive <mark4>blooms.</mark4><br>
But I've told you all I <mark1>know.</mark1><br>
I was sure she had <mark1>secrets,</mark1><br>
but she had no <mark1>secrets.</mark1><br>
I had to tell her mine.<br>
