Title : The Homecoming Singer <br>
Author : Jay Wright <br><br>

The plane tilts in to <mark4>Nashville,</mark4><br>
coming over the green <mark1>lights</mark1><br>
like a toy train skipping <mark4>past</mark4><br>
the signals on a <mark4>track.</mark4><br>
The city is livid with <mark1>lights,</mark1><br>
as if the weight of all the <mark4>people</mark4><br>
shooting down her <mark4>arteries</mark4><br>
had inflamed <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
It's Friday <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
and people are home for the <mark1>homecomings.</mark1><br>
As I come into the <mark4>terminal,</mark4><br>
a young black man, in a vested gray <mark4>suit,</mark4><br>
paces in the florid Tennessee <mark3>air,</mark3><br>
breaks into a run like a <mark4>halfback</mark4><br>
in open field, going past the delirious <mark4>faces,</mark4><br>
past the poster of Molly <mark3>Bee</mark3><br>
in her shiny chaps, her hips tilted <mark4>forward</mark4><br>
where the guns would be, her legs <mark4>set,</mark4><br>
as if she would run, as if she <mark3>were</mark3><br>
a cheerleader who doffs her <mark4>guns</mark4><br>
on Saturday afternoon and <mark4>careens</mark4><br>
down the sidelines after some broken field runner,   <br>
who carries it in, for now, <br>
for all the state of <mark3>Tennessee</mark3><br>
with its nut-smelling <mark4>trees,</mark4><br>
its stolid little stone <mark4>walls</mark4><br>
set out under thick blankets of <mark4>leaves,</mark4><br>
its crisp lights dangling on the <mark4>porches</mark4><br>
of homes that top the graveled <mark4>driveways,</mark4><br>
where people who cannot yodel or <mark4>yell</mark4><br>
putter in the grave October <mark4>afternoons,</mark4><br>
waiting for Saturday night and the <mark1>lights</mark1><br>
that spatter on Molly Bee's silver <mark4>chaps.</mark4><br>
I don't want to think of <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
or even of the broken field runner in the <mark1>terminal,</mark1><br>
still looking for his girl, his <mark4>pocket</mark4><br>
full of dates and parties, as I <mark4>come</mark4><br>
into this Friday night of <mark1>homecomings</mark1><br>
and hobble over the highway in a <mark4>taxi</mark4><br>
that has its radio tuned to country <mark4>music.</mark4><br>
I come up to the <mark4>campus,</mark4><br>
with a large wreath jutting up <br>
under the elegant <mark4>dormitories,</mark4><br>
where one girl sits looking down at the shrieking <mark4>cars,</mark4><br>
as the lights go out, one by one, around <mark3>her</mark3><br>
and the laughter drifts off, <mark1>rising</mark1>, <mark1>rising,</mark1><br>
as if it would take flight away <br>
from the livid arteries of <mark1>Nashville.</mark1><br>
Now, in sleep, I leave my brass-headed <mark4>bed,</mark4><br>
and see her enter with tall <mark4>singers,</mark4><br>
they in African shirts, she in a robe.   <br>
She sits among them, as a golden <mark4>lance</mark4><br>
catches her, suddenly chubby, with soft <mark4>lips</mark4><br>
and unhurried eyes, quite still in the <mark4>movement</mark4><br>
around her, waiting, as the other voices <mark4>fade,</mark4><br>
as the movement stops, and starts to <mark4>sing,</mark4><br>
her voice moving up from its tart <mark4>entrance</mark4><br>
until it swings as <mark4>freely</mark4><br>
as an ecstatic dancer's <mark4>foot,</mark4><br>
rises and plays among the <mark4>windows</mark4><br>
it would with angels and <mark4>falls,</mark4><br>
almost visible, to return to <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
and leave her shaking with the <mark4>tears</mark4><br>
I'm ashamed to release, and leave <mark1>her</mark1><br>
twisting there on that stool with my <mark4>shame</mark4><br>
for the livid <mark4>arteries</mark4>, the flat <mark4>Saturdays,</mark4><br>
the inhuman homecomings of <mark1>Nashville.</mark1><br>
I kneel before her. She strokes my <mark3>hair,</mark3><br>
as softly as she would a cat's <mark4>head,</mark4><br>
and goes on <mark4>singing</mark4>, her voice <mark4>shifting</mark4><br>
and bringing up the Carolina <mark4>calls,</mark4><br>
the waterboy, the railroad cutter, the <mark4>jailed,</mark4><br>
the condemned, all that had been <mark5>forgotten</mark5><br>
on this night of homecomings, <mark4>all</mark4><br>
that had been misplaced in those livid <mark1>arteries.</mark1><br>
She <mark4>finishes</mark4>, and <mark1>leaves,</mark1><br>
her shy head tilted and <mark4>wrinkled</mark4><br>
in the green-tinged lights of the still <mark1>campus.</mark1><br>
I close my eyes and <mark4>listen,</mark4><br>
as she goes out to sing this city <mark4>home.</mark4><br>
