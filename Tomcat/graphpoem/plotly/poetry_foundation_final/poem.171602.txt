Title : Christmas Eve: My Mother Dressing <br>
Author : Toi Derricotte <br><br>

My mother was not impressed with her beauty; <br>
once a year she put it on like a costume, <br>
plaited her black hair, slick as cornsilk, down past her <mark4>hips,</mark4><br>
in one rope-thick braid, turned it, carefully, hand over <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
and fixed it at the nape of her neck, stiff and elegant as a <mark4>crown,</mark4><br>
with tortoise pins, like huge <mark4>insects,</mark4><br>
some belonging to her dead <mark4>mother,</mark4><br>
some to my living <mark4>grandmother.</mark4><br>
Sitting on the stool at the <mark4>mirror,</mark4><br>
she applied a peachy foundation that seemed to hold her down, to trap <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
as if we never would have noticed what flew among us unless it was weighted and bound in its mask. <br>
Vaseline shined her <mark4>eyebrows,</mark4><br>
mascara blackened her lashes until they swept down like <mark4>feathers;</mark4><br>
her eyes deepened until they shone from far away. <br>
<br>
Now I remember her hands, her poor hands, which, even then were old from scrubbing, <br>
whiter on the inside than they should have <mark4>been,</mark4><br>
and hard, the first joints of her <mark4>fingers</mark4>, little fattened <mark4>pads,</mark4><br>
the nails filed to sharp points like old-fashioned ink <mark4>pens,</mark4><br>
painted a jolly <mark4>color.</mark4><br>
Her hands stood next to her face and wanted to be put away, <mark4>prayed</mark4><br>
for the scrub bucket and brush to make them useful.   <br>
And, as I write, I forget the years I watched <mark1>her</mark1><br>
pull hairs like a witch from her chin, magnify <br>
every blotch--as if acid were thrown from the <mark4>inside.</mark4><br>
<br>
But once a year my <mark1>mother</mark1><br>
rose in her white silk slip, <br>
not the slave of the house, the <mark4>woman,</mark4><br>
took the ironed dress from the <mark4>hanger--</mark4><br>
allowing me to stand on the bed, so that   <br>
my face looked directly into her <mark4>face,</mark4><br>
and hold the garment away from <mark1>her</mark1><br>
as she pulled it <mark4>down.</mark4><br>
