Title : Easter Wings <br>
Author : George Herbert <br><br>

Lord, who createdst man in wealth and <mark3>store,</mark3><br>
Though foolishly he lost the <mark3>same,</mark3><br>
Decaying more and <mark3>more,</mark3><br>
Till he <mark3>became</mark3><br>
Most <mark4>poore:</mark4><br>
With <mark3>thee</mark3><br>
O let me <mark4>rise</mark4><br>
            As larks, harmoniously, <br>
And sing this day thy <mark4>victories:</mark4><br>
Then shall the fall further the flight in <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
<br>
My tender age in sorrow did beginne <br>
And still with sicknesses and <mark3>shame.</mark3><br>
            Thou didst so punish sinne, <br>
That I <mark1>became</mark1><br>
Most <mark5>thinne.</mark5><br>
With <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
Let me <mark3>combine,</mark3><br>
And feel thy <mark5>victorie:</mark5><br>
For, if I imp my wing on <mark3>thine,</mark3><br>
Affliction shall advance the flight in <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
