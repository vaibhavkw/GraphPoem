Title : The Old Swimmin' Hole <br>
Author : James Whitcomb Riley <br><br>

Oh! the old swimmin'-hole! whare the crick so still and <mark3>deep</mark3><br>
Looked like a baby-river that was laying half <mark3>asleep,</mark3><br>
And the gurgle of the worter round the drift jest <mark3>below</mark3><br>
Sounded like the laugh of something we onc't ust to <mark3>know</mark3><br>
Before we could remember anything but the <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
Of the angels lookin' out as we left <mark4>Paradise;</mark4><br>
But the merry days of youth is beyond our <mark1>controle,</mark1><br>
And it's hard to part ferever with the old <mark3>swimmin'-hole.</mark3><br>
<br>
Oh! the old swimmin'-hole! In the happy days of yore, <br>
When I ust to lean above it on the old sickamore, <br>
Oh! it showed me a face in its warm sunny <mark4>tide</mark4><br>
That gazed back at me so gay and <mark4>glorified,</mark4><br>
It made me love myself, as I leaped to <mark4>caress</mark4><br>
My shadder smilin' up at me with sich <mark4>tenderness.</mark4><br>
But them days is past and gone, and old Time's tuck his <mark3>toll</mark3><br>
From the old man come back to the old <mark1>swimmin'-hole.</mark1><br>
<br>
Oh! the old swimmin'-hole! In the long, lazy <mark4>days</mark4><br>
When the humdrum of school made so many <mark4>run-a-ways,</mark4><br>
How plesant was the jurney down the old dusty <mark3>lane,</mark3><br>
Whare the tracks of our bare feet was all printed so <mark3>plane</mark3><br>
You could tell by the dent of the heel and the <mark3>sole</mark3><br>
They was lots o' fun on hands at the old <mark1>swimmin'-hole.</mark1><br>
But the lost joys is past! Let your tears in sorrow <mark3>roll</mark3><br>
Like the rain that ust to dapple up the old <mark1>swimmin'-hole.</mark1><br>
<br>
Thare the bullrushes growed, and the cattails so <mark4>tall,</mark4><br>
And the sunshine and shadder fell over it <mark3>all;</mark3><br>
And it mottled the worter with amber and <mark4>gold</mark4><br>
Tel the glad lilies rocked in the ripples that <mark3>rolled;</mark3><br>
And the snake-feeder's four gauzy wings fluttered <mark3>by</mark3><br>
Like the ghost of a daisy dropped out of the <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
Or a wownded apple-blossom in the breeze's <mark1>controle</mark1><br>
As it cut acrost some orchard to'rds the old <mark1>swimmin'-hole.</mark1><br>
<br>
Oh! the old swimmin'-hole! When I last saw the <mark4>place,</mark4><br>
The scenes was all changed, like the change in my <mark3>face;</mark3><br>
The bridge of the railroad now crosses the spot <br>
Whare the old divin'-log lays sunk and fergot. <br>
And I stray down the banks whare the trees ust to <mark3>be--</mark3><br>
But never again will theyr shade shelter <mark3>me!</mark3><br>
And I wish in my sorrow I could strip to the <mark3>soul,</mark3><br>
And dive off in my grave like the old <mark1>swimmin'-hole.</mark1><br>
