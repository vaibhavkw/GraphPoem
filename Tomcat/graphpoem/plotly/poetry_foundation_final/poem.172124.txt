Title : The Bistro Styx <br>
Author : Rita Dove <br><br>

She was thinner, with a mannered <mark4>gauntness</mark4><br>
as she paused just inside the <mark4>double</mark4><br>
glass doors to survey the room, silvery <mark1>cape</mark1><br>
billowing dramatically behind her. What's <mark4>this,</mark4><br>
<br>
I thought, lifting a hand <mark4>until</mark4><br>
she nodded and started across the <mark3>parquet;</mark3><br>
that's when I saw she was dressed all in <mark3>gray,</mark3><br>
from a kittenish cashmere skirt and <mark4>cowl</mark4><br>
<br>
down to the graphite signature of her <mark3>shoes.</mark3><br>
"Sorry I'm late," she panted, though   <br>
she wasn't, sliding into the chair, her <mark1>cape</mark1><br>
<br>
tossed off in a shudder of brushed <mark4>steel.</mark4><br>
We kissed. Then I leaned back to <mark3>peruse</mark3><br>
my blighted child, this wary aristocratic <mark4>mole.</mark4><br>
<br>
"How's business?" I asked, and hazarded   <br>
a motherly smile to keep from crying <mark3>out:</mark3><br>
Are you content to conduct your <mark3>life</mark3><br>
as a cliche and, what's <mark4>worse,</mark4><br>
an anachronism, the brooding artist's demimonde?   <br>
<br>
Near the rue Princesse they had <mark4>opened</mark4><br>
a gallery cum souvenir shop which <mark4>featured</mark4><br>
fuzzy off-color Monets next to his acrylics, no <mark3>doubt,</mark3><br>
plus bearded African drums and the occasional <mark4>miniature</mark4><br>
<br>
gargoyle from Notre Dame the Great Artist <mark4>had</mark4><br>
carved at breakfast with a pocket <mark3>knife.</mark3><br>
"Tourists love us. The Parisians, of <mark4>course"--</mark4><br>
<br>
she blushed--"are amused, though not <mark3>without</mark3><br>
a certain admiration <mark4>..."</mark4><br>
                                     The Chateaubriand <br>
arrived on a bone-white <mark4>plate</mark4>, smug and <mark4>absolute</mark4><br>
<br>
in its fragrant crust, a black plug <mark5>steaming</mark5><br>
like the heart plucked from the chest of a worthy <mark4>enemy;</mark4><br>
one touch with her fork sent pink juices <mark3>streaming.</mark3><br>
"Admiration for what?" Wine, a <mark4>bloody</mark4><br>
Pinot Noir, brought color to her cheeks. <mark3>"Why,</mark3><br>
<br>
the aplomb with which we've <mark4>managed</mark4><br>
to support our Art"--meaning he'd <mark4>convinced</mark4><br>
her to pose nude for his appalling <mark4>canvases,</mark4><br>
faintly futuristic landscapes <mark4>strewn</mark4><br>
<br>
with carwrecks and bodies being <mark4>chewed</mark4><br>
by rabid cocker spaniels. "I'd like to come <mark3>by</mark3><br>
the studio," I ventured, "and see the new <mark4>stuff."</mark4><br>
<br>
"Yes, if you wish ..." A delicate <mark3>rebuff</mark3><br>
before the warning: "He dresses <mark4>all</mark4><br>
in black now. Me, he drapes in blues and <mark4>carmine--</mark4><br>
<br>
and even though I think it's kinda <mark4>cute,</mark4><br>
in company I tend toward more muted <mark4>shades."</mark4><br>
She paused and had the <mark4>grace</mark4><br>
to drop her eyes. She did look <mark4>ravishing,</mark4><br>
spookily insubstantial, a lipstick ghost on <mark3>tissue,</mark3><br>
<br>
or as if one stood on a fifth-floor <mark4>terrace</mark4><br>
peering through a fringe of rain at <mark4>Paris'</mark4><br>
dreaming chimney pots, each sooty <mark3>issue</mark3><br>
wobbling skyward in an ecstatic oracular <mark4>spiral.</mark4><br>
<br>
"And he never thinks of food. I wish <br>
I didn't have to plead with him to eat ...." <mark3>Fruit</mark3><br>
and cheese appeared, arrayed on leaf-green <mark4>dishes.</mark4><br>
<br>
I stuck with cafe creme. "This Camembert's <br>
so ripe," she joked, "it's practically grown <mark4>hair,"</mark4><br>
mucking a golden glob complete with parsley sprig   <br>
<br>
onto a heel of bread. Nothing seemed to <mark4>fill</mark4><br>
her up: She swallowed, sliced into a <mark3>pear,</mark3><br>
speared each tear-shaped lavaliere <br>
and popped the dripping mess into her pretty <mark3>mouth.</mark3><br>
Nowhere the bright tufted fields, <mark4>weighted</mark4><br>
<br>
vines and sun poured down out of the <mark3>south.</mark3><br>
"But are you happy?" Fearing, I whispered <mark4>it</mark4><br>
quickly. "What? You know, Mother"-- <br>
she bit into the starry rose of a fig-- <br>
<br>
"one really should try the fruit <mark4>here."</mark4><br>
I've lost her, I thought, and called for the <mark3>bill.</mark3><br>
