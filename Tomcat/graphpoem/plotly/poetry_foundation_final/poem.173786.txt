Title : Parental Recollections <br>
Author : Charles Lamb <br><br>

A child's a plaything for an hour;<br>
Its pretty tricks we <mark3>try</mark3><br>
For that or for a longer <mark4>space;</mark4><br>
Then tire, and lay it <mark3>by.</mark3><br>
<br>
But I knew one, that to itself<br>
      All seasons could controul;<br>
That would have mock'd the sense of pain<br>
      Out of a grieved soul.<br>
<br>
Thou, straggler into loving <mark4>arms,</mark4><br>
Young climber up of <mark4>knees,</mark4><br>
When I forget thy thousand <mark4>ways,</mark4><br>
Then life and all shall <mark4>cease.</mark4><br>
