Title : A Grammarian's Funeral <br>
Author : Robert Browning <br><br>

Shortly after the Revival of Learning in <mark4>Europe</mark4><br>
Let us begin and carry up this <mark4>corpse,</mark4><br>
Singing <mark3>together.</mark3><br>
Leave we the common crofts, the vulgar <mark5>thorpes</mark5><br>
Each in its <mark3>tether</mark3><br>
Sleeping safe on the bosom of the <mark3>plain,</mark3><br>
Cared-for till <mark3>cock-crow:</mark3><br>
Look out if yonder be not day <mark3>again</mark3><br>
Rimming the <mark3>rock-row!</mark3><br>
That's the appropriate country; there, man's <mark5>thought,</mark5><br>
         Rarer, intenser, <br>
Self-gathered for an outbreak, as it <mark3>ought,</mark3><br>
Chafes in the <mark4>censer.</mark4><br>
Leave we the unlettered plain its herd and <mark4>crop;</mark4><br>
         Seek we sepulture <br>
On a tall mountain, citied to the <mark3>top,</mark3><br>
Crowded with <mark4>culture!</mark4><br>
All the peaks soar, but one the rest <mark4>excels;</mark4><br>
Clouds overcome <mark4>it;</mark4><br>
No! yonder sparkle is the <mark4>citadel's</mark4><br>
Circling its <mark3>summit.</mark3><br>
Thither our path lies; wind we up the <mark4>heights:</mark4><br>
Wait ye the <mark3>warning?</mark3><br>
Our low life was the level's and the <mark3>night's;</mark3><br>
He's for the <mark3>morning.</mark3><br>
Step to a tune, square chests, erect each <mark3>head,</mark3><br>
         'Ware the beholders! <br>
This is our master, famous, calm and <mark3>dead,</mark3><br>
Borne on our <mark4>shoulders.</mark4><br>
<br>
Sleep, crop and herd! sleep, darkling thorpe and <mark4>croft,</mark4><br>
Safe from the <mark4>weather!</mark4><br>
He, whom we convoy to his grave <mark3>aloft,</mark3><br>
Singing <mark1>together,</mark1><br>
He was a man born with thy face and <mark4>throat,</mark4><br>
Lyric <mark3>Apollo!</mark3><br>
Long he lived nameless: how should spring take <mark3>note</mark3><br>
Winter would <mark3>follow?</mark3><br>
Till lo, the little touch, and youth was <mark4>gone!</mark4><br>
Cramped and <mark4>diminished,</mark4><br>
Moaned he, "New measures, other feet anon! <br>
My dance is <mark3>finished"?</mark3><br>
No, that's the world's way: (keep the <mark4>mountain-side,</mark4><br>
Make for the <mark5>city!)</mark5><br>
He knew the signal, and stepped on with <mark4>pride</mark4><br>
Over men's <mark3>pity;</mark3><br>
Left play for work, and grappled with the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
Bent on <mark4>escaping:</mark4><br>
"What's in the scroll," quoth he, "thou keepest furled <br>
Show me their <mark3>shaping,</mark3><br>
Theirs who most studied man, the bard and <mark3>sage,</mark3><br>
Give!" So, he gowned <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
Straight got by heart that book to its last <mark3>page:</mark3><br>
Learned, we found <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
Yea, but we found him bald too, eyes like <mark4>lead,</mark4><br>
Accents <mark4>uncertain:</mark4><br>
"Time to taste life," another would have <mark3>said,</mark3><br>
"Up with the <mark3>curtain!"</mark3><br>
This man said rather, "Actual life comes <mark4>next?</mark4><br>
Patience a <mark4>moment!</mark4><br>
Grant I have mastered learning's crabbed <mark4>text,</mark4><br>
Still there's the <mark4>comment.</mark4><br>
Let me know all! Prate not of most or <mark4>least,</mark4><br>
Painful or <mark4>easy!</mark4><br>
Even to the crumbs I'd fain eat up the <mark3>feast,</mark3><br>
Ay, nor feel <mark3>queasy."</mark3><br>
Oh, such a life as he resolved to <mark3>live,</mark3><br>
When he had learned <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
When he had gathered all books had to <mark3>give!</mark3><br>
Sooner, he spurned <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
Image the whole, then execute the <mark4>parts</mark4><br>
Fancy the <mark4>fabric</mark4><br>
Quite, ere you build, ere steel strike fire from <mark4>quartz,</mark4><br>
Ere mortar dab <mark4>brick!</mark4><br>
<br>
(Here's the town-gate reached: there's the <mark4>market-place</mark4><br>
Gaping before <mark4>us.)</mark4><br>
Yea, this in him was the peculiar <mark4>grace</mark4><br>
(Hearten our <mark4>chorus!)</mark4><br>
That before living he'd learn how to <mark1>live</mark1><br>
No end to <mark4>learning:</mark4><br>
Earn the means first   God surely will <mark3>contrive</mark3><br>
Use for our <mark3>earning.</mark3><br>
Others mistrust and say, "But time <mark4>escapes:</mark4><br>
Live now or <mark4>never!"</mark4><br>
He said, "What's time? Leave Now for dogs and <mark3>apes!</mark3><br>
Man has <mark3>Forever."</mark3><br>
Back to his book then: deeper drooped his <mark1>head:</mark1><br>
Calculus racked <mark1>him:</mark1><br>
Leaden before, his eyes grew dross of <mark1>lead:</mark1><br>
Tussis attacked <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
"Now, master, take a little rest!" not <mark3>he!</mark3><br>
(Caution <mark4>redoubled</mark4><br>
Step two abreast, the way winds <mark4>narrowly!)</mark4><br>
Not a whit <mark3>troubled,</mark3><br>
Back to his studies, fresher than at <mark4>first,</mark4><br>
Fierce as a <mark4>dragon</mark4><br>
He (soul-hydroptic with a sacred <mark3>thirst)</mark3><br>
          Sucked at the flagon. <br>
Oh, if we draw a circle <mark3>premature,</mark3><br>
Heedless of far <mark4>gain,</mark4><br>
Greedy for quick returns of profit, <mark3>sure</mark3><br>
Bad is our <mark4>bargain!</mark4><br>
Was it not great? did not he throw on <mark4>God,</mark4><br>
          (He loves the burthen) <br>
God's task to make the heavenly <mark4>period</mark4><br>
Perfect the <mark4>earthen?</mark4><br>
Did not he magnify the mind, show <mark4>clear</mark4><br>
Just what it all <mark4>meant?</mark4><br>
He would not discount life, as fools do <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
          Paid by instalment. <br>
He ventured neck or nothing heaven's <mark4>success</mark4><br>
Found, or earth's <mark4>failure:</mark4><br>
"Wilt thou trust death or not?" He answered <mark3>"Yes:</mark3><br>
Hence with life's pale <mark4>lure!"</mark4><br>
That low man seeks a little thing to <mark3>do,</mark3><br>
Sees it and does <mark1>it:</mark1><br>
This high man, with a great thing to <mark3>pursue,</mark3><br>
Dies ere he knows <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
That low man goes on adding one to <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
His hundred's soon <mark3>hit:</mark3><br>
This high <mark4>man</mark4>, aiming at a <mark4>million,</mark4><br>
Misses an <mark4>unit.</mark4><br>
<mark4>That</mark4>, has the world here   should he need the <mark1>next,</mark1><br>
Let the world mind <mark1>him!</mark1><br>
This, throws himself on God, and unperplexed <br>
Seeking shall find <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
So, with the throttling hands of death at <mark3>strife,</mark3><br>
Ground he at <mark4>grammar;</mark4><br>
Still, thro' the rattle, parts of speech were <mark3>rife:</mark3><br>
While he could <mark3>stammer</mark3><br>
He settled Hoti's business let it <mark4>be!</mark4><br>
          Properly based Oun <br>
Gave us the doctrine of the enclitic <mark3>De,</mark3><br>
Dead from the waist <mark4>down.</mark4><br>
Well, here's the platform, here's the proper <mark4>place:</mark4><br>
Hail to your <mark5>purlieus,</mark5><br>
All ye highfliers of the feathered <mark3>race,</mark3><br>
Swallows and <mark5>curlews!</mark5><br>
Here's the top-peak; the multitude <mark3>below</mark3><br>
Live, for they can, <mark4>there:</mark4><br>
This man decided not to Live but <mark3>Know</mark3><br>
Bury this man <mark1>there?</mark1><br>
Here   here's his place, where meteors shoot, clouds <mark4>form,</mark4><br>
Lightnings are <mark4>loosened,</mark4><br>
Stars come and go! Let joy break with the <mark3>storm,</mark3><br>
Peace let the dew <mark4>send!</mark4><br>
Lofty designs must close in like <mark4>effects:</mark4><br>
Loftily <mark4>lying,</mark4><br>
Leave him   still loftier than the world <mark3>suspects,</mark3><br>
Living and <mark3>dying.</mark3><br>
