Title : Parsley <br>
Author : Rita Dove <br><br>

1. The Cane <mark4>Fields</mark4><br>
<br>
There is a parrot imitating <mark1>spring</mark1><br>
in the palace, its feathers parsley <mark4>green.</mark4><br>
Out of the swamp the cane <mark4>appears</mark4><br>
<br>
to haunt us, and we cut it down. El <mark4>General</mark4><br>
searches for a <mark4>word</mark4>, he is all the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
there is. Like a parrot imitating <mark1>spring,</mark1><br>
<br>
we lie down screaming as rain punches <mark3>through</mark3><br>
and we come up green. We cannot speak an <mark4>R--</mark4><br>
out of the swamp, the cane <mark1>appears</mark1><br>
<br>
and then the mountain we call in whispers <mark1>Katalina.</mark1><br>
The children gnaw their teeth to <mark4>arrowheads.</mark4><br>
There is a parrot imitating <mark1>spring.</mark1><br>
<br>
El General has found his word: perejil. <br>
Who says it, lives. He laughs, teeth <mark4>shining</mark4><br>
out of the swamp. The cane <mark1>appears</mark1><br>
<br>
in our dreams, lashed by wind and <mark4>streaming.</mark4><br>
And we lie down. For every drop of <mark4>blood</mark4><br>
there is a parrot imitating <mark1>spring.</mark1><br>
Out of the swamp the cane <mark1>appears.</mark1><br>
<br>
2. The <mark4>Palace</mark4><br>
The word the general's chosen is <mark5>parsley.</mark5><br>
<br>
It is fall, when thoughts <mark4>turn</mark4><br>
to love and death; the general <mark4>thinks</mark4><br>
of his mother, how she died in the <mark4>fall</mark4><br>
and he planted her walking cane at the <mark4>grave</mark4><br>
and it flowered, each spring stolidly <mark4>forming</mark4><br>
four-star blossoms. The <mark1>general</mark1><br>
pulls on his boots, he stomps <mark3>to</mark3><br>
<br>
her room in the palace, the one <mark4>without</mark4><br>
curtains, the one with a <mark4>parrot</mark4><br>
in a brass ring. As he paces he <mark4>wonders</mark4><br>
Who can I kill today. And for a <mark4>moment</mark4><br>
the little knot of <mark4>screams</mark4><br>
is still. The parrot, who has <mark4>traveled</mark4><br>
all the way from Australia in an <mark4>ivory</mark4><br>
<br>
cage, is, coy as a widow, practising   <br>
<mark4>spring</mark4>, Ever since the <mark4>morning</mark4><br>
his mother collapsed in the <mark4>kitchen</mark4><br>
while baking skull-shaped <mark4>candies</mark4><br>
for the Day of the Dead, the <mark1>general</mark1><br>
has hated sweets. He orders <mark4>pastries</mark4><br>
brought up for the bird; they <mark4>arrive</mark4><br>
dusted with sugar on a bed of <mark4>lace.</mark4><br>
<br>
The knot in his throat starts to twitch;   <br>
he sees his boots the first day in <mark4>battle</mark4><br>
splashed with mud and <mark4>urine</mark4><br>
as a soldier falls at his feet <mark4>amazed--</mark4><br>
how stupid he looked!-- at the <mark4>sound</mark4><br>
of artillery. I never thought it would <mark4>sing</mark4><br>
the soldier said, and died. Now <br>
the general sees the fields of sugar   <br>
<br>
cane, lashed by rain and <mark1>streaming.</mark1><br>
He sees his mother's smile, the <mark4>teeth</mark4><br>
gnawed to <mark4>arrowheads</mark4>, He <mark4>hears</mark4><br>
the Haitians sing without <mark4>R's</mark4><br>
as they swing the great <mark4>machetes:</mark4><br>
Katalina, they sing, <mark1>Katalina,</mark1><br>
mi madle, mi amol en muelte. God <mark4>knows</mark4><br>
<br>
his mother was no stupid woman; she   <br>
could roll an R like a <mark4>queen</mark4>, <mark4>Even</mark4><br>
a parrot can roll an R! In the bare room   <br>
the bright feathers arch in a <mark4>parody</mark4><br>
of greenery, as the last pale <mark4>crumbs</mark4><br>
disappear under the blackened tongue. <mark4>Someone</mark4><br>
calls out his name in a <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
<br>
so like his mother's, a startled <mark4>tear</mark4><br>
splashes the tip of his right <mark4>boot.</mark4><br>
My mother, my love in <mark4>death.</mark4><br>
The general remembers the tiny green <mark5>sprigs</mark5><br>
men of his village wore in their <mark4>capes</mark4><br>
to honor the birth of a son. He <mark4>will</mark4><br>
order many, this time, to be <mark4>killed</mark4><br>
for a single, beautiful <mark4>word.</mark4><br>
