Title : Battle-Hymn of the Republic <br>
Author : Julia Ward Howe <br><br>

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the <mark3>Lord:</mark3><br>
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are <mark3>stored;</mark3><br>
He hath loosed the fatal lightning of his terrible swift <mark3>sword:</mark3><br>
His truth is marching <mark1>on.</mark1><br>
<br>
I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling <mark3>camps;</mark3><br>
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and <mark3>damps;</mark3><br>
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring <mark3>lamps.</mark3><br>
His Day is marching <mark1>on.</mark1><br>
<br>
I have read a fiery <mark4>gospel</mark4>, writ in burnished rows of <mark4>steel:</mark4><br>
"As ye deal with my contemners, so with you my grace shall <mark3>deal;</mark3><br>
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his <mark3>heel,</mark3><br>
Since God is marching <mark1>on."</mark1><br>
<br>
He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call <mark3>retreat;</mark3><br>
He is sifting out the hearts of men before his <mark3>judgment-seat:</mark3><br>
Oh! be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be <mark4>jubilant</mark4>, my <mark3>feet!</mark3><br>
Our God is marching <mark1>on.</mark1><br>
<br>
In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the <mark3>sea,</mark3><br>
With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and <mark3>me:</mark3><br>
As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
While God is marching <mark1>on.</mark1><br>
