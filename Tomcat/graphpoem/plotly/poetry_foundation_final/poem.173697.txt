Title : The Embankment <br>
Author : T. E. Hulme <br><br>

(The fantasia of a fallen gentleman on a cold, bitter <mark4>night.)</mark4><br>
Once, in finesse of fiddles found I ecstasy, <br>
In the flash of gold heels on the hard <mark4>pavement.</mark4><br>
Now see <mark3>I</mark3><br>
That warmth's the very stuff of poesy. <br>
Oh, God, make small <br>
The old star-eaten blanket of the <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
That I may fold it round me and in comfort <mark3>lie.</mark3><br>
