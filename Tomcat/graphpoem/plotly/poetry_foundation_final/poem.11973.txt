Title : The Bloody Sire<br>
Author : Robinson Jeffers<br><br>

It is not bad.  Let them <mark1>play.</mark1><br>
Let the guns bark and the <mark4>bombing-plane</mark4><br>
Speak his prodigious blasphemies. <br>
It is not bad, it is high time, <br>
Stark violence is still the sire of all the world's <mark1>values.</mark1><br>
<br>
What but the wolf's tooth whittled so <mark4>fine</mark4><br>
The fleet limbs of the antelope? <br>
What but fear winged the birds, and <mark4>hunger</mark4><br>
Jewelled with such eyes the great goshawk's head? <br>
Violence has been the sire of all the world's <mark1>values.</mark1><br>
<br>
Who would remember Helen's face <br>
Lacking the terrible halo of <mark4>spears?</mark4><br>
Who formed Christ but Herod and <mark4>Caesar,</mark4><br>
The cruel and bloody victories of <mark1>Caesar?</mark1><br>
Violence, the bloody sire of all the world's <mark1>values.</mark1><br>
<br>
Never weep, let them <mark1>play,</mark1><br>
Old violence is not too old to beget new <mark1>values.</mark1><br>
