Title : The Jain Bird Hospital in Delhi <br>
Author : William Meredith <br><br>

Outside the hotel window, unenlightened <mark4>pigeons</mark4><br>
weave and dive like Stukas on their <mark1>prey,</mark1><br>
apparently some tiny insect <mark5>brother.</mark5><br>
(In India, the attainment of <mark3>nonviolence</mark3><br>
is considered a proper goal for human <mark4>beings.)</mark4><br>
If one of the pigeons should fly into the <mark1>illusion</mark1><br>
<br>
of my window and survive (the body is no <mark1>illusion</mark1><br>
when it's hurt) he could be taken across town to the <mark5>bird</mark5><br>
hospital where Jains, skilled medical <mark4>men,</mark4><br>
repair the feathery sick and broken <mark4>victims.</mark4><br>
There, in reproof of <mark3>violence</mark3><br>
and of nothing else, live Mahavira's brothers and <mark4>sisters.</mark4><br>
<br>
To this small, gentle order of monks and <mark4>nuns</mark4><br>
it is bright Vishnu and dark Shiva who are <mark1>illusion.</mark1><br>
They trust in faith, cognition, and <mark1>nonviolence</mark1><br>
to release them from rebirth. They think that <mark4>birds</mark4><br>
and animals?like us, some predators, some <mark1>prey?</mark1><br>
should be ministered to no less than men and <mark4>women.</mark4><br>
<br>
The Jains who deal with creatures (and with <mark4>laymen)</mark4><br>
wear white, while their more enterprising hermit <mark4>brothers</mark4><br>
walk naked and are called the sky-clad. Jains <mark2>pray</mark2><br>
to no deity, human kindness being their sole <mark1>illusion.</mark1><br>
Mahavira and those twenty-three other airy <mark4>creatures</mark4><br>
who turned to saints with him, preached the doctrine of ahimsa,<br>
<br>
which in our belligerent tongue becomes <mark1>nonviolence.</mark1><br>
It's not a doctrine congenial to snarers and poultrymen, <br>
who every day bring to market maimed <mark4>pheasants.</mark4><br>
Numbers of these are brought in by the Jain <mark1>brothers</mark1><br>
and brought, to grow back wing-tips and <mark4>illusions,</mark4><br>
to one of the hospitals succoring such small quarry.<br>
<br>
When strong and feathered again, the lucky <mark1>victims</mark1><br>
get reborn on Sunday mornings to the world's <mark1>violence,</mark1><br>
released from the roofs of these temples to <mark1>illusion.</mark1><br>
It is hard for a westerner to speak about men and <mark1>women</mark1><br>
like <mark4>these</mark4>, who call the birds of the air <mark1>brothers.</mark1><br>
We recall the embarrassed fanfare for Francis and his flock.<br>
<br>
We're poor forked sky-clad things <mark4>ourselves</mark4><br>
and God knows prey to illusion?e.g., I claim these <mark1>brothers</mark1><br>
and sisters in India, stemming a little violence, among <mark1>birds.</mark1><br>
