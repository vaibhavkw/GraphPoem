Title : Prairie Houses <br>
Author : Barbara Guest <br><br>

Unreasonable lenses refract <mark4>the</mark4><br>
sensitive rabbit holes, mole dwellings and snake   <br>
climes where twist burrow and <mark4>sneeze</mark4><br>
a native <mark4>species</mark4><br>
<br>
into <mark4>houses</mark4><br>
<br>
corresponding to hemispheric <mark4>requests</mark4><br>
of <mark4>flatness</mark4><br>
<br>
euphemistically, sentimentally   <br>
termed <mark4>prairie.</mark4><br>
<br>
On the earth exerting a willful pressure <br>
<br>
something like a stethoscope against the <mark4>breast</mark4><br>
<br>
only <mark4>permanent.</mark4><br>
<br>
Selective engineering architectural submissiveness   <br>
and rendering of necessity in regard to <mark4>height,</mark4><br>
eschewment of climate exposure, elemental <mark4>understandings,</mark4><br>
constructive adjustments to vale and storm <br>
<br>
historical reconstruction of early earthworks   <br>
<br>
and admiration <br>
<br>
for later even oriental modelling <br>
<br>
for a glimpse of baronial burdening <br>
we see it in the rafters and the staircase heaviness   <br>
a surprise yet acting as ballast <mark4>surely</mark4><br>
<br>
the heavens strike hard on <mark4>prairies.</mark4><br>
<br>
Regard its hard-mouthed houses with <mark5>their</mark5><br>
robust nipples the gossamer <mark3>hair.</mark3><br>
