Title : The Kid <br>
Author : Ai <br><br>

My sister rubs the doll's face in <mark4>mud,</mark4><br>
then climbs through the truck <mark1>window.</mark1><br>
She ignores me as I walk around <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
hitting the flat tires with an iron <mark4>rod.</mark4><br>
The old man yells for me to help hitch the <mark4>team,</mark4><br>
but I keep walking around the truck, hitting <mark4>harder,</mark4><br>
until my mother <mark4>calls.</mark4><br>
I pick up a rock and throw it at the kitchen <mark1>window,</mark1><br>
but it falls <mark4>short.</mark4><br>
The old man's voice bounces off the air like a <mark4>ball</mark4><br>
I can't lift my leg <mark4>over.</mark4><br>
<br>
I stand beside him, waiting, but he doesn't look up <br>
and I squeeze the rod, raise it, his skull splits <mark4>open.</mark4><br>
Mother runs toward us. I stand <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
get her across the spine as she bends over <mark4>him.</mark4><br>
I drop the rod and take the rifle from the <mark4>house.</mark4><br>
Roses are red, violets are blue, <br>
one bullet for the black horse, two for the <mark4>brown.</mark4><br>
They're down quick. I spit, my tongue's bloody;   <br>
I've bitten it. I laugh, remember the one out <mark4>back.</mark4><br>
I catch her climbing from the truck, <mark4>shoot.</mark4><br>
The doll lands on the ground with her. <br>
I pick it up, rock it in my <mark4>arms.</mark4><br>
Yeah. I'm Jack, Hogarth's <mark4>son.</mark4><br>
I'm nimble, I'm <mark4>quick.</mark4><br>
In the house, I put on the old man's best <mark3>suit</mark3><br>
and his patent leather <mark4>shoes.</mark4><br>
I pack my mother's satin nightgown <br>
and my sister's doll in the <mark4>suitcase.</mark4><br>
Then I go outside and cross the fields to the highway. <br>
I'm fourteen. I'm a wind from nowhere.   <br>
I can break your <mark4>heart.</mark4><br>
