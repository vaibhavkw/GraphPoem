Title : A Sister on the Tracks <br>
Author : Donald Hall <br><br>

Between pond and sheepbarn, by maples and watery birches,   <br>
Rebecca paces a double line of <mark4>rust</mark4><br>
in a sandy trench, striding on <mark4>black</mark4><br>
creosoted eight-by-eights. <br>
In <mark4>nineteen-forty-three,</mark4><br>
wartrains skidded <mark4>tanks,</mark4><br>
airframes, dynamos, <mark4>searchlights</mark4>, and <mark4>troops</mark4><br>
to Montreal. She counted <mark4>cars</mark4><br>
from the stopped hayrack at the endless <mark4>crossing:</mark4><br>
ninety-nine, one hundred; and her grandfather <mark4>Ben's</mark4><br>
voice shaking with rage and oratory <mark4>told</mark4><br>
how the mighty Boston and <mark4>Maine</mark4><br>
kept the Statehouse in its <mark4>pocket.</mark4><br>
Today Rebecca <mark4>walks</mark4><br>
a line that vanishes, in <mark4>solitude</mark4><br>
bypassed by wars and commerce. She remembers the <mark4>story</mark4><br>
of the bunting'd day her <mark4>great-great-great-</mark4><br>
grandmother watched the first train roll and <mark4>smoke</mark4><br>
from Potter Place to <mark3>Gale</mark3><br>
with fireworks, cider, and speeches. Then the long <mark3>rail</mark3><br>
drove west, buzzing and humming; the hive of rolling <mark4>stock</mark4><br>
extended a thousand-car'd perspective <br>
from Ohio to Oregon, where men who left stone <mark4>farms</mark4><br>
rode rails toward <mark4>gold.</mark4><br>
On this blue day she <mark1>walks</mark1><br>
under a high jet's glint of swooped aluminum <mark4>pulling</mark4><br>
its feathery contrail <mark4>westward</mark4>, She sees <mark4>ahead</mark4><br>
how the jet dies into junk, and highway <mark4>wastes</mark4><br>
like railroad. Beside her the old creation <mark4>retires,</mark4><br>
hayrack sunk like a <mark4>rowboat</mark4><br>
under its fields of hay. She closes her <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
to glimpse the vertical track that <mark4>rises</mark4><br>
from the underworld of <mark4>graves,</mark4><br>
soul's ascension connecting dead to unborn, <mark4>rails</mark4><br>
that hum with a hymn of continual <mark4>vanishing</mark4><br>
where tracks <mark4>cross.</mark4><br>
For she opens her eyes to <mark3>read</mark3><br>
on a solitary gravestone next to the <mark1>rails</mark1><br>
the familiar names of Ruth and Matthew Bott, <mark4>born</mark4><br>
in a Norfolk parish, who <mark4>ventured</mark4><br>
the immigrant's passionate Exodus westward to labor   <br>
on their own land. Here love <mark4>builds</mark4><br>
its mortal house, where today's wind <mark4>carries</mark4><br>
a double scent of heaven and cut hay.<br>
