Title : Pied Beauty <br>
Author : Gerard Manley Hopkins <br><br>

Glory be to God for dappled things <mark3>-</mark3><br>
For skies of couple-colour as a brinded <mark3>cow;</mark3><br>
For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that <mark3>swim;</mark3><br>
Fresh-firecoal <mark4>chestnut-falls</mark4>, finches' <mark3>wings;</mark3><br>
Landscape plotted and pieced - fold, fallow, and <mark3>plough;</mark3><br>
And all trades, their gear and tackle and <mark3>trim.</mark3><br>
<br>
All things counter, original, spare, <mark3>strange;</mark3><br>
Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows <mark3>how?)</mark3><br>
With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, <mark3>dim;</mark3><br>
He fathers-forth whose beauty is past <mark3>change:</mark3><br>
Praise <mark3>him.</mark3><br>
