Author : Toi Derricotte <br><br>

The most popular "act" <mark4>in</mark4><br>
Penn <mark4>Station</mark4><br>
is the three black kids in <mark4>ratty</mark4><br>
sneakers & T-shirts <mark4>playing</mark4><br>
two violins and a cello--Brahms.   <br>
White men in business <mark4>suits</mark4><br>
have already dug into their <mark4>pockets</mark4><br>
as they pass and they toss <mark1>in</mark1><br>
a dollar or two without <mark4>stopping.</mark4><br>
Brown men in work-soiled <mark4>khakis</mark4><br>
stand with their mouths <mark4>open,</mark4><br>
arms crossed on their <mark4>bellies</mark4><br>
as if they themselves have <mark4>always</mark4><br>
wanted to attempt those <mark4>bars.</mark4><br>
One white boy, three, <mark4>sits</mark4><br>
cross-legged in front of <mark4>his</mark4><br>
idols--in <mark4>ecstasy--</mark4><br>
their slick, dark <mark4>faces,</mark4><br>
their thin, wiry <mark4>arms,</mark4><br>
who must begin to look <br>
like <mark4>angels!</mark4><br>
Why does this <mark4>trembling</mark4><br>
pull <mark4>us?</mark4><br>
A: Beneath the surface we are <mark4>one.</mark4><br>
B: Amazing! I did not think that they could speak this <mark4>tongue.</mark4><br>
