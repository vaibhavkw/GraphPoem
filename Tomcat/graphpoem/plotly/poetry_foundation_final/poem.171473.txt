Title : The Black Hose <br>
Author : Bruce Weigl <br><br>

A boy who knew enough to save for <mark4>something</mark4><br>
like the whim that took me downtown on the <mark3>bus</mark3><br>
one lost Saturday morning of my mother's birthday,   <br>
I sat in the back where the gasoline <mark4>smell</mark4><br>
made me dizzy and I closed my eyes but <mark4>didn't</mark4><br>
think of her, only of myself, basking in the <mark4>light</mark4><br>
and love that would fall down on me when I   <br>
handed her the box and she untied the bow to <mark4>save</mark4><br>
and lifted something shining out and held it up before <mark3>us</mark3><br>
like a promise taking shape for once in her <mark4>hands,</mark4><br>
though I didn't know what to buy, the bus <mark3>door</mark3><br>
hissing behind me because I'm in some kind <mark4>of</mark4><br>
state now, a trance that comes when you <mark4>pull</mark4><br>
at the cords of light that connect the mother to the <mark1>boy,</mark1><br>
the 1959 department <mark3>store</mark3><br>
opening up before me like a jeweled city.   <br>
In lingerie I found <mark4>myself</mark4><br>
surrounded by those torsos sheened in <mark4>silk,</mark4><br>
dreaming my mother, feeling the silk against <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
the two of us moving through a cloudy <mark1>room</mark1><br>
in a dance I can't remember until shame <mark4>comes.</mark4><br>
From out of nowhere the matron <mark4>frowned,</mark4><br>
asked what I wanted, hovered over <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
Confused and afraid I whispered, without <mark4>thinking,</mark4><br>
The black hose with rhinestones down the seams <mark4>please</mark4><br>
and pointed to the pair across the <mark1>room</mark1><br>
stretched over legs on the glass counter   <br>
as if about to step <mark4>off</mark4><br>
and I saw her in my mind slip them <mark4>on,</mark4><br>
her skirt hiked above the garters, the <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
catching in her tangled <mark4>hair</mark4><br>
until the matron made a sound in her <mark4>throat</mark4><br>
and looked at me with eyes that <mark4>said</mark4><br>
What's wrong with you dirty <mark1>boy.</mark1><br>
<br>
All the way home a sweet ache rocked <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
the silver package riding my <mark4>lap</mark4><br>
like a heavy wrong <mark4>thing</mark4><br>
I couldn't give up no matter how <mark4>it</mark4><br>
dragged me down to a <mark4>place</mark4><br>
where I could barely breathe or see or <mark4>feel.</mark4><br>
Whatever happened that spinning <mark4>afternoon--</mark4><br>
she ran her fingers over the rhinestone <mark4>seams</mark4><br>
or she didn't, she wore them out into an <mark4>evening</mark4><br>
or kept them forever in her drawer of impossible <mark4>things--</mark4><br>
doesn't matter. I would find my way into the <mark1>light</mark1><br>
of another woman into whose arms I <mark4>fall</mark4><br>
nights my fingers can't tear through the <mark4>dark</mark4><br>
that eats me, the silk stretched across her <mark4>breasts,</mark4><br>
the need for something womanly to raise me <mark4>up</mark4><br>
pounding in my head until I curl in <mark4>sleep</mark4><br>
away from those longings, ancient and blue.<br>
