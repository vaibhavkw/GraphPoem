Title : The Minks <br>
Author : Toi Derricotte <br><br>

In the backyard of our house on <mark4>Norwood,</mark4><br>
there were five hundred steel cages lined <mark4>up,</mark4><br>
each with a wooden <mark4>box</mark4><br>
roofed with tar paper; <br>
inside, two stories, with straw <br>
for a bed. Sometimes the minks would <mark4>pace</mark4><br>
back and forth wildly, looking for a way out; <br>
or else they'd hide in their wooden houses, even when   <br>
we'd put the offering of raw horse meat on their trays, as if   <br>
they knew they were <mark4>beautiful</mark4><br>
and wanted to deprive <mark4>us.</mark4><br>
In spring the placid <mark4>kits</mark4><br>
drank with glazed <mark4>eyes.</mark4><br>
Sometimes the mothers would go <mark4>mad</mark4><br>
and snap their <mark4>necks.</mark4><br>
My uncle would lift the roof like a <mark4>god</mark4><br>
who might lift our roof, look down on <mark1>us</mark1><br>
and take us out to <mark4>safety.</mark4><br>
Sometimes one would <mark4>escape.</mark4><br>
He would go down on his hands and <mark4>knees,</mark4><br>
aiming a flashlight <mark1>like</mark1><br>
a bullet of light, hoping to <mark4>catch</mark4><br>
the orange gold of its <mark1>eyes.</mark1><br>
He wore huge boots, <mark4>gloves</mark4><br>
so thick their little teeth couldn't bite through.   <br>
"They're wild," he'd say. "Never trust <mark4>them."</mark4><br>
Each afternoon when I put the scoop of raw meat <mark4>rich</mark4><br>
with eggs and vitamins on their <mark4>trays,</mark4><br>
I'd call to each a <mark4>greeting.</mark4><br>
Their small thin faces would follow as if slightly <mark4>curious.</mark4><br>
In fall they went out in a van, <mark4>returning</mark4><br>
sorted, matched, their skins hanging down on huge <mark4>metal</mark4><br>
<mark4>hangers</mark4>, pinned by their <mark4>mouths.</mark4><br>
My uncle would take them out when company <mark4>came</mark4><br>
and drape them over his arm--the sweetest cargo.   <br>
He'd blow down the pelts <mark4>softly</mark4><br>
and the hairs would part for his breath <br>
and show the shining underlife which, <mark1>like</mark1><br>
the shining of the soul, gives us <mark4>each</mark4><br>
character and <mark4>beauty.</mark4><br>
