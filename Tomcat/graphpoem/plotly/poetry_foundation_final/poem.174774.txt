Title : Constancy <br>
Author : John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester <br><br>

I cannot change, as others <mark3>do,</mark3><br>
Though you unjustly <mark3>scorn;</mark3><br>
Since that poor swain, that sighs for <mark3>you</mark3><br>
For you alone was <mark3>born.</mark3><br>
No, Phyllis, no, your heart to <mark4>move</mark4><br>
A surer way I'll <mark3>try:</mark3><br>
And to revenge my slighted <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
Will still love on, will still love on, and <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
<br>
When, kill'd with grief, Amyntas <mark3>lies;</mark3><br>
And you to mind shall <mark3>call</mark3><br>
The sighs that now unpitied <mark3>rise;</mark3><br>
The tears that vainly <mark3>fall:</mark3><br>
That welcome hour that ends this <mark3>smart,</mark3><br>
Will then begin your <mark4>pain;</mark4><br>
For such a faithful, tender <mark3>heart</mark3><br>
Can never break, can never break in <mark3>vain.</mark3><br>
