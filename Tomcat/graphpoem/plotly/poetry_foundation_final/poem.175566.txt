Author : Anne Bronte <br><br>

I hoped, that with the brave and <mark3>strong,</mark3><br>
My portioned task might <mark3>lie;</mark3><br>
To toil amid the busy <mark3>throng,</mark3><br>
With purpose pure and <mark3>high.</mark3><br>
<br>
But God has fixed another <mark3>part,</mark3><br>
And He has fixed it <mark3>well;</mark3><br>
I said so with my bleeding <mark3>heart,</mark3><br>
When first the anguish <mark3>fell.</mark3><br>
<br>
A dreadful darkness closes <mark3>in</mark3><br>
On my bewildered <mark3>mind;</mark3><br>
Oh, let me suffer and not <mark3>sin,</mark3><br>
Be <mark4>tortured</mark4>, yet <mark3>resigned.</mark3><br>
<br>
Shall I with joy thy blessings <mark3>share</mark3><br>
And not endure their <mark3>loss?</mark3><br>
Or hope the martyr's crown to <mark3>wear</mark3><br>
And cast away the <mark3>cross?</mark3><br>
<br>
Thou, God, hast taken our <mark4>delight,</mark4><br>
Our treasured hope <mark3>away;</mark3><br>
Thou bidst us now weep through the <mark3>night</mark3><br>
And sorrow through the <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
<br>
These weary hours will not be <mark4>lost,</mark4><br>
These days of <mark4>misery,</mark4><br>
These nights of darkness, anguish-tost,<br>
Can I but turn to <mark3>Thee.</mark3><br>
<br>
Weak and weary though I <mark1>lie,</mark1><br>
Crushed with sorrow, worn with <mark4>pain,</mark4><br>
I may lift to Heaven mine <mark3>eye,</mark3><br>
And strive to labour not in <mark3>vain;</mark3><br>
<br>
That inward strife against the <mark5>sins</mark5><br>
That ever wait on <mark4>suffering</mark4><br>
To strike whatever first <mark3>begins:</mark3><br>
Each ill that would corruption <mark4>bring;</mark4><br>
<br>
That secret labour to <mark3>sustain</mark3><br>
With humble patience every <mark3>blow;</mark3><br>
To gather fortitude from <mark1>pain,</mark1><br>
And hope and holiness from <mark3>woe.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thus let me serve Thee from my <mark1>heart,</mark1><br>
Whate'er may be my written <mark4>fate:</mark4><br>
Whether thus early to <mark4>depart,</mark4><br>
Or yet a while to <mark4>wait.</mark4><br>
<br>
If thou shouldst bring me back to <mark3>life,</mark3><br>
More humbled I should <mark3>be;</mark3><br>
More wise, more strengthened for the <mark3>strife,</mark3><br>
More apt to lean on <mark1>Thee.</mark1><br>
<br>
Should death be standing at the <mark3>gate,</mark3><br>
Thus should I keep my <mark3>vow;</mark3><br>
<mark4>But</mark4>, Lord! whatever be my <mark1>fate,</mark1><br>
Oh, let me serve Thee <mark3>now!</mark3><br>
