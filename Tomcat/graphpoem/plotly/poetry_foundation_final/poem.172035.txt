Title : from The Bridge: Atlantis <br>
Author : Hart Crane <br><br>

Through the bound cable strands, the arching <mark4>path</mark4><br>
Upward, veering with light, the flight of <mark4>strings,--</mark4><br>
Taut miles of shuttling moonlight <mark4>syncopate</mark4><br>
The whispered rush, telepathy of <mark4>wires.</mark4><br>
Up the index of night, granite and <mark4>steel--</mark4><br>
Transparent meshes--fleckless the gleaming <mark4>staves--</mark4><br>
Sibylline voices flicker, waveringly <mark5>stream</mark5><br>
As though a god were issue of the strings. . . <mark1>.</mark1><br>
<br>
And through that cordage, threading with its <mark4>call</mark4><br>
One arc synoptic of all tides <mark3>below--</mark3><br>
Their labyrinthine mouths of <mark4>history</mark4><br>
Pouring reply as though all ships at <mark3>sea</mark3><br>
Complighted in one vibrant breath made <mark3>cry,--</mark3><br>
"Make thy love sure--to weave whose song we <mark3>ply!"</mark3><br>
--From black embankments, moveless soundings <mark4>hailed,</mark4><br>
So seven oceans answer from their <mark3>dream.</mark3><br>
<br>
And on, obliquely up bright carrier <mark4>bars</mark4><br>
New octaves trestle the twin <mark4>monoliths</mark4><br>
Beyond whose frosted capes the moon bequeaths   <br>
Two worlds of sleep (O arching strands of <mark4>song!)--</mark4><br>
Onward and up the crystal-flooded <mark4>aisle</mark4><br>
White tempest nets file upward, upward <mark4>ring</mark4><br>
With silver terraces the humming <mark5>spars,</mark5><br>
The loft of vision, palladium helm of <mark3>stars.</mark3><br>
<br>
Sheerly the eyes, like seagulls stung with rime-- <br>
Slit and propelled by glistening fins of <mark4>light--</mark4><br>
Pick biting way up towering looms that <mark4>press</mark4><br>
Sidelong with flight of blade on tendon <mark4>blade</mark4><br>
--Tomorrows into yesteryear--and link <br>
What cipher-script of time no traveller <mark4>reads</mark4><br>
But who, through smoking pyres of love and <mark4>death,</mark4><br>
Searches the timeless laugh of mythic <mark4>spears.</mark4><br>
<br>
Like hails, farewells--up planet-sequined <mark4>heights</mark4><br>
Some trillion whispering hammers glimmer <mark4>Tyre:</mark4><br>
Serenely, sharply up the long anvil <mark1>cry</mark1><br>
Of inchling aeons silence rivets <mark3>Troy.</mark3><br>
And you, aloft there--Jason! hesting <mark4>Shout!</mark4><br>
Still wrapping harness to the swarming <mark3>air!</mark3><br>
Silvery the rushing wake, surpassing <mark1>call,</mark1><br>
Beams yelling Aeolus! splintered in the <mark4>straits!</mark4><br>
<br>
From gulfs unfolding, terrible of <mark4>drums,</mark4><br>
Tall Vision-of-the-Voyage, tensely <mark3>spare--</mark3><br>
Bridge, lifting night to cycloramic <mark4>crest</mark4><br>
Of deepest day--O Choir, translating <mark4>time</mark4><br>
Into what multitudinous Verb the <mark4>suns</mark4><br>
And synergy of waters ever fuse, <mark4>recast</mark4><br>
In myriad syllables,--Psalm of <mark1>Cathay!</mark1><br>
O Love, thy white, pervasive Paradigm . . . <mark4>!</mark4><br>
<br>
We left the haven hanging in the <mark4>night</mark4><br>
Sheened harbor lanterns backward fled the <mark4>keel.</mark4><br>
Pacific here at time's end, bearing <mark4>corn,--</mark4><br>
Eyes stammer through the pangs of dust and <mark1>steel.</mark1><br>
And still the circular, indubitable <mark4>frieze</mark4><br>
Of heaven's meditation, yoking <mark4>wave</mark4><br>
To kneeling wave, one song devoutly <mark4>binds--</mark4><br>
The vernal strophe chimes from deathless <mark1>strings!</mark1><br>
<br>
O Thou steeled Cognizance whose leap <mark4>commits</mark4><br>
The agile precincts of the lark's <mark4>return;</mark4><br>
Within whose lariat sweep encinctured <mark3>sing</mark3><br>
In single chrysalis the many <mark4>twain,--</mark4><br>
Of stars Thou art the stitch and stallion <mark3>glow</mark3><br>
And like an organ, Thou, with sound of <mark4>doom--</mark4><br>
Sight, sound and flesh Thou leadest from time's <mark4>realm</mark4><br>
As love strikes clear direction for the <mark3>helm.</mark3><br>
<br>
Swift peal of secular light, intrinsic <mark4>Myth</mark4><br>
Whose fell unshadow is death's utter <mark4>wound,--</mark4><br>
O River-throated--iridescently upborne <br>
Through the bright drench and fabric of our <mark4>veins;</mark4><br>
With white escarpments swinging into <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
Sustained in tears the cities are <mark4>endowed</mark4><br>
And justified conclamant with ripe <mark4>fields</mark4><br>
Revolving through their harvests in sweet <mark4>torment.</mark4><br>
<br>
Forever Deity's glittering Pledge, O Thou   <br>
Whose canticle fresh chemistry <mark4>assigns</mark4><br>
To wrapt inception and beatitude,-- <br>
Always through blinding cables, to our <mark3>joy,</mark3><br>
Of thy white seizure springs the <mark4>prophecy:</mark4><br>
Always through spiring cordage, <mark4>pyramids</mark4><br>
Of silver sequel, Deity's young <mark4>name</mark4><br>
Kinetic of white choiring wings . . . <mark4>ascends.</mark4><br>
<br>
Migrations that must needs void <mark4>memory,</mark4><br>
Inventions that cobblestone the <mark4>heart,--</mark4><br>
Unspeakable Thou Bridge to Thee, O <mark4>Love.</mark4><br>
Thy pardon for this history, whitest <mark4>Flower,</mark4><br>
O Answerer of all,--Anemone,-- <br>
Now while thy petals spend the suns about us, <mark4>hold--</mark4><br>
(O Thou whose radiance doth inherit <mark3>me)</mark3><br>
Atlantis,--hold thy floating singer <mark4>late!</mark4><br>
<br>
So to thine Everpresence, beyond <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
Like spears ensanguined of one tolling <mark4>star</mark4><br>
That bleeds infinity--the orphic <mark1>strings,</mark1><br>
Sidereal phalanxes, leap and converge:   <br>
--One Song, one Bridge of Fire! Is it <mark1>Cathay,</mark1><br>
Now pity steeps the grass and rainbows <mark1>ring</mark1><br>
The serpent with the eagle in the leaves. . . . <mark4>?</mark4><br>
Whispers antiphonal in azure <mark3>swing.</mark3><br>
