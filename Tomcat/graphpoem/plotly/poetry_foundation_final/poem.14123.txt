Title : Ceremony<br>
Author : Richard Wilbur<br><br>

A striped blouse in a clearing by <mark1>Bazille</mark1><br>
Is, you may say, a patroness of <mark3>boughs</mark3><br>
Too queenly kind toward nature to be <mark3>kin.</mark3><br>
But ceremony never did conceal, <br>
Save to the silly eye, which all <mark3>allows,</mark3><br>
How much we are the woods we wander <mark3>in.</mark3><br>
<br>
Let her be some Sabrina fresh from <mark3>stream,</mark3><br>
Lucent as shallows slowed by wading <mark4>sun,</mark4><br>
Bedded on fern, the flowers' cynosure: <br>
Then nymph and wood must nod and strive to <mark3>dream</mark3><br>
That she is airy earth, the trees, <mark3>undone,</mark3><br>
Must ape her languor natural and pure. <br>
<br>
Ho-hum. I am for wit and wakefulness,   <br>
And love this feigning lady by <mark1>Bazille.</mark1><br>
What's lightly hid is deepest <mark5>understood,</mark5><br>
And when with social smile and formal <mark5>dress</mark5><br>
She teaches leaves to curtsey and quadrille,   <br>
I think there are most tigers in the <mark3>wood.</mark3><br>
