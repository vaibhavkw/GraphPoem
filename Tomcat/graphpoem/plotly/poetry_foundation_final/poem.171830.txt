Title : That Pull from the Left <br>
Author : Louise Erdrich <br><br>

Butch once remarked to me how sinister it <mark4>was</mark4><br>
alone, after hours, in the dark of the <mark4>shop</mark4><br>
to find me there hunched over two weeks' <mark4>accounts</mark4><br>
probably smoked like a bacon from all those <mark4>Pall-Malls.</mark4><br>
<br>
Odd comfort when the light goes, the case lights left on   <br>
and the rings of baloney, the herring, the <mark5>parsley,</mark5><br>
arranged in the strict, familiar <mark4>ways.</mark4><br>
<br>
Whatever intactness holds animals <mark4>up</mark4><br>
has been carefully taken, what's left are the <mark4>parts.</mark4><br>
Just look in the cases, all counted and <mark4>stacked.</mark4><br>
<br>
Step-and-a-Half Waleski used to come to the <mark1>shop</mark1><br>
and ask for the cheap cut, she would thump, sniff, and <mark4>finger.</mark4><br>
This one too old. This one here for my <mark4>supper.</mark4><br>
Two days and you do notice change in the <mark4>texture.</mark4><br>
<br>
I have seen them the day before <mark4>slaughter.</mark4><br>
Knowing the outcome from the moment they <mark4>enter</mark4><br>
the chute, the eye rolls, blood is smeared on the <mark4>lintel.</mark4><br>
Mallet or bullet they lunge toward their <mark4>darkness.</mark4><br>
<br>
But something queer happens when the heart is <mark4>delivered.</mark4><br>
When a child is born, sometimes the left hand is <mark4>stronger.</mark4><br>
You can train it to fail, still the knowledge is there.   <br>
That is the knowledge in the hand of a <mark4>butcher</mark4><br>
<br>
that adds to its weight. Otto Kroger could <mark4>fell</mark4><br>
a dray horse with one well-placed punch to the jaw,   <br>
and yet it is well known how thorough he <mark1>was.</mark1><br>
<br>
He never sat down without washing his <mark4>hands,</mark4><br>
and he was a maker, his sausage was echt <br>
so that even Waleski had little <mark4>complaint.</mark4><br>
Butch once remarked there was no one so <mark4>deft</mark4><br>
as my Otto. So true, there is great tact <mark4>involved</mark4><br>
in parting the flesh from the bones that it <mark4>loves.</mark4><br>
<br>
How we cling to the bones. Each joint is a web <br>
of small tendons and fibers. He knew what I <mark4>meant</mark4><br>
when I told him I felt something pull from the <mark4>left,</mark4><br>
and how often it clouded the day before <mark1>slaughter.</mark1><br>
<br>
Something queer happens when the heart is <mark1>delivered.</mark1><br>
