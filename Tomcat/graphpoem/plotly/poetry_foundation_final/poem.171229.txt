Title : Pleasures <br>
Author : Denise Levertov <br><br>

I like to <mark4>find</mark4><br>
what's not <mark4>found</mark4><br>
at once, but <mark4>lies</mark4><br>
<br>
within something of another nature,   <br>
in repose, distinct.   <br>
Gull feathers of glass, hidden <br>
<br>
in white pulp: the bones of <mark4>squid</mark4><br>
which I pull out and lay <br>
blade by blade on the draining <mark4>board--</mark4><br>
<br>
tapered as if for <mark4>swiftness</mark4>, to <mark4>pierce</mark4><br>
the heart, but fragile, <mark4>substance</mark4><br>
       belying design.               Or a fruit, mamey, <br>
<br>
cased in rough brown peel, the flesh   <br>
rose-amber, and the <mark4>seed:</mark4><br>
the seed a stone of <mark4>wood</mark4>, carved <mark4>and</mark4><br>
<br>
polished, <mark4>walnut-colored</mark4>, <mark4>formed</mark4><br>
like a brazilnut, but large, <br>
large enough to fill <br>
the hungry palm of a <mark4>hand.</mark4><br>
<br>
I like the juicy stem of grass that <mark4>grows</mark4><br>
within the coarser leaf folded <mark4>round,</mark4><br>
and the butteryellow glow <br>
in the narrow flute from which the <mark5>morning-glory</mark5><br>
opens blue and cool on a hot <mark5>morning.</mark5><br>
