Title : A Color of the Sky <br>
Author : Tony Hoagland <br><br>

Windy today and I feel less than <mark4>brilliant,</mark4><br>
driving over the hills from <mark4>work.</mark4><br>
There are the dark parts on the <mark4>road</mark4><br>
when you pass through clumps of <mark4>wood</mark4><br>
and the bright spots where you have a view of the <mark4>ocean,</mark4><br>
but that doesn't make the road an <mark4>allegory.</mark4><br>
<br>
I should call Marie and <mark4>apologize</mark4><br>
for being so boring at dinner last <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
but can I really promise not to be that way <mark4>again?</mark4><br>
And anyway, I'd rather watch the trees, tossing   <br>
in what certainly looks like sexual <mark4>arousal.</mark4><br>
<br>
Otherwise it's spring, and everything looks <mark4>frail;</mark4><br>
the sky is baby blue, and the just-unfurling <mark4>leaves</mark4><br>
are full of infant <mark4>chlorophyll,</mark4><br>
the very tint of <mark4>inexperience.</mark4><br>
<br>
Last summer's song is making a comeback on the radio,   <br>
and on the highway <mark4>overpass,</mark4><br>
the only metaphysical vandal in America has <mark4>written</mark4><br>
MEMORY LOVES TIME <br>
in big black spraypaint <mark4>letters,</mark4><br>
<br>
which makes us wonder if Time loves Memory <mark4>back.</mark4><br>
<br>
Last night I dreamed of X <mark1>again.</mark1><br>
She's like a stain on my subconscious <mark4>sheets.</mark4><br>
Years ago she penetrated me <br>
but though I scrubbed and scrubbed and <mark4>scrubbed,</mark4><br>
I never got her <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
but now I'm <mark4>glad.</mark4><br>
<br>
What I thought was an end turned out to be a <mark4>middle.</mark4><br>
What I thought was a brick wall turned out to be a <mark4>tunnel.</mark4><br>
What I thought was an <mark4>injustice</mark4><br>
turned out to be a color of the sky. <br>
<br>
Outside the youth center, between the liquor <mark4>store</mark4><br>
and the police <mark4>station,</mark4><br>
a little dogwood tree is losing its <mark4>mind;</mark4><br>
<br>
overflowing with blossomfoam,   <br>
like a sudsy mug of <mark4>beer;</mark4><br>
like a bride ripping off her <mark4>clothes,</mark4><br>
<br>
dropping snow white petals to the ground in <mark4>clouds,</mark4><br>
<br>
so Nature's wastefulness seems quietly <mark4>obscene.</mark4><br>
It's been doing that all <mark4>week:</mark4><br>
making <mark4>beauty,</mark4><br>
and throwing it away, <br>
and making <mark4>more.</mark4><br>
