Title : Vuillard: "The Mother and Sister of the Artist" <br>
Author : W. D. Snodgrass <br><br>

(Instructions for the <mark4>Visit)</mark4><br>
Admire, when you come <mark4>here</mark4>, the glimmering <mark4>hair</mark4><br>
Of the <mark4>girl</mark4>, praise her <mark4>pale</mark4><br>
Complexion. Think well of her <mark4>dress</mark4><br>
Though that is somewhat out of <mark4>fashion.</mark4><br>
Don't try to take her hand, but smile <mark4>for</mark4><br>
Her hesitant <mark4>gentleness.</mark4><br>
Say the old woman is looking <mark4>strong</mark4><br>
Today; such hardiness. <mark4>Remark,</mark4><br>
Perhaps, how she has dressed herself <mark4>black</mark4><br>
Like a priest, and wears that sufficient <mark4>air</mark4><br>
That does become the <mark4>righteous.</mark4><br>
As you approach, she will push <mark3>back</mark3><br>
Her chair, shove away her <mark4>plate</mark4><br>
And <mark3>wait,</mark3><br>
Sitting squat and direct, <mark4>before</mark4><br>
The red mahogany <mark4>chest</mark4><br>
Massive as some <mark4>great</mark4><br>
Safe; will <mark1>wait,</mark1><br>
By the table and her greasy <mark1>plate,</mark1><br>
The bone <mark4>half-chewed</mark4>, her wine <mark4>half-drained;</mark4><br>
She will wait. And fix her <mark4>steady</mark4><br>
Eyes on you--the straight <mark4>stare</mark4><br>
Of an old <mark4>politician.</mark4><br>
Try once to meet her eyes. But <mark3>fail.</mark3><br>
Let your <mark4>sight</mark4><br>
Drift--yet never as if hunting <mark1>for</mark1><br>
The keys (you keep imagining) <mark4>hung</mark4><br>
By her belt. (They are not <mark4>there.)</mark4><br>
Watch, perhaps, that massive chest--the <mark3>way</mark3><br>
It tries to <mark4>lean</mark4><br>
Forward, toward her, till it seems to <mark4>rest</mark4><br>
Its whole household's <mark4>weight</mark4><br>
Of linens and clothing and <mark4>provisions</mark4><br>
All on her stiff <mark1>back.</mark1><br>
It might be strapped there like the monstrous <mark3>pack</mark3><br>
Of some enchanted pedlar. Dense, <mark3>self-contained,</mark3><br>
Like mercury in a <mark4>ball,</mark4><br>
She can support this without <mark4>strain,</mark4><br>
Yet she grows smaller, <mark4>wrinkling</mark4><br>
Like a potato, parched as <mark4>dung;</mark4><br>
It cramps her like a <mark4>fist.</mark4><br>
Ask no one why the <mark1>chest</mark1><br>
Has no knobs. <mark3>Betray</mark3><br>
No least <mark4>suspicion</mark4><br>
The necessities <mark4>within</mark4><br>
Could vanish at <mark3>her</mark3><br>
Will. Try not to <mark4>think</mark4><br>
That as she <mark4>feeds</mark4>, <mark4>gains</mark4><br>
Specific <mark4>gravity,</mark4><br>
She shrinks, <mark4>light-</mark4><br>
less as the <mark4>world's</mark4><br>
Hard <mark4>core</mark4><br>
And the <mark3>per-</mark3><br>
spective <mark4>drains</mark4><br>
In <mark1>her.</mark1><br>
Finally, above <mark3>all,</mark3><br>
You must not ever <mark1>see,</mark1><br>
Or let slip one hint you can <mark1>see,</mark1><br>
On the other side, the <mark4>girl's</mark4><br>
<mark4>Cuffs</mark4>, like cordovan <mark4>restraints;</mark4><br>
Forget her bony, tentative <mark4>wrist,</mark4><br>
The half-fed, worrying eyes, and <mark3>how</mark3><br>
She backs out, bows, and tries to <mark3>bow</mark3><br>
Out of the scene, grows too <mark4>ethereal</mark4><br>
To make a shape inside her <mark1>dress</mark1><br>
And the dress itself is beginning <mark4>already</mark4><br>
To sublime itself away like a <mark4>vapor</mark4><br>
That merges into the empty <mark4>twinkling</mark4><br>
Of the air and of the bright <mark4>wallpaper.</mark4><br>
