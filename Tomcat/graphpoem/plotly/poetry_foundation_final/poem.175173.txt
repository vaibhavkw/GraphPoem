Title : The Portent <br>
Author : Herman Melville <br><br>

Hanging from the beam, <br>
Slowly swaying (such the <mark3>law),</mark3><br>
Gaunt the shadow on your <mark4>green,</mark4><br>
<br>
The cut is on the <mark4>crown</mark4><br>
(Lo, John <mark3>Brown),</mark3><br>
And the stabs shall heal no <mark3>more.</mark3><br>
<br>
Hidden in the cap <br>
Is the anguish none can <mark3>draw;</mark3><br>
So your future veils its face, <br>
<br>
But the streaming beard is <mark4>shown</mark4><br>
(Weird John <mark1>Brown),</mark1><br>
The meteor of the <mark3>war.</mark3><br>
