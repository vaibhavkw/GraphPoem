Title : I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, (340) <br>
Author : Emily Dickinson <br><br>

I felt a Funeral, in my <mark3>Brain,</mark3><br>
And Mourners to and fro<br>
Kept treading - treading - till it <mark4>seemed</mark4><br>
That Sense was breaking through - <br>
<br>
And when they all were <mark4>seated,</mark4><br>
A Service, like a Drum <mark3>-</mark3><br>
Kept beating - beating - till I thought <br>
My mind was going numb <mark3>-</mark3><br>
<br>
And then I heard them lift a <mark4>Box</mark4><br>
And creak across my <mark3>Soul</mark3><br>
With those same Boots of Lead, <mark3>again,</mark3><br>
Then Space - began to <mark3>toll,</mark3><br>
<br>
As all the Heavens were a <mark4>Bell,</mark4><br>
And Being, but an <mark3>Ear,</mark3><br>
And I, and <mark4>Silence</mark4>, some strange <mark4>Race,</mark4><br>
Wrecked, solitary, here <mark3>-</mark3><br>
<br>
And then a Plank in Reason, broke, <br>
And I dropped <mark1>down</mark1>, and down <mark4>-</mark4><br>
And hit a World, at every plunge, <br>
And Finished knowing - then <mark4>-</mark4><br>
