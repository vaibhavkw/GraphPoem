Title : Conclusion<br>
Author : John Frederick Nims<br><br>

legato con amore in un volume cio che per l'universo si squaderna . . .<br>
If what began (look far and wide) will <mark3>end:</mark3><br>
This lava globe huddle and freeze, its <mark3>core</mark3><br>
Brittle with <mark4>cold</mark4>, or pulled too near its <mark3>friend</mark3><br>
Pop once like one gun in a long-drawn <mark3>war,</mark3><br>
And the stars sputter one by one, the <mark4>night</mark4><br>
So empty judging empty's out of <mark4>date</mark4><br>
(Space and time gone), then only, height on <mark4>height,</mark4><br>
Mind that impelled those currents and that <mark4>freight,</mark4><br>
Mind that after five days (see those <mark3>days!</mark3><br>
Regions all tropic one day, one all <mark4>ice!)</mark4><br>
Whistled man from the sea-moss, saw him <mark3>raise</mark3><br>
The blundering forepaw, blink from shaggy <mark4>eyes--</mark4><br>
If image, likeness in the ox-yoke brow   <br>
Long out of focus, focused mind to <mark4>Mind--</mark4><br>
Ah what unspeakable two and two <mark4>allows</mark4><br>
That silence huddle and all eyes go <mark3>blind?</mark3><br>
Our ups and downs--there! that remembered <mark4>makes</mark4><br>
Memory which is the single mind. How <mark4>sweet</mark4><br>
Carmine stars of the maple fumed in <mark3>rakes</mark3><br>
At 1350 such and such a <mark3>street.</mark3><br>
A thing to keep in mind. Yes and keep <mark4>yet</mark4><br>
When the vile essence violescence <mark4>lies.</mark4><br>
Once in winter by the richening <mark3>sill</mark3><br>
Quiet, the fireplace tiny in our <mark1>eyes--</mark1><br>
I mention this; there's more. The Almighty <mark3>will</mark3><br>
Aeons late stumble on it with <mark3>surprise.</mark3><br>
