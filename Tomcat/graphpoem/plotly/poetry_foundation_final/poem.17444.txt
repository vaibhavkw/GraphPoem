Title : Nude Descending a Staircase <br>
Author : X J Kennedy <br><br>

Toe after toe, a snowing flesh, <br>
a gold of lemon, root and <mark3>rind,</mark3><br>
she sifts in sunlight down the <mark3>stairs</mark3><br>
with nothing on. Nor on her <mark3>mind.</mark3><br>
<br>
We spy beneath the banister <br>
a constant thresh of thigh on <mark3>thigh;</mark3><br>
her lips imprint the swinging <mark3>air</mark3><br>
that parts to let her parts go <mark3>by.</mark3><br>
<br>
One-woman waterfall, she <mark3>wears</mark3><br>
her slow descent like a long <mark3>cape</mark3><br>
and pausing on the final <mark3>stair,</mark3><br>
collects her motions into <mark3>shape.</mark3><br>
