Title : Yesterdays <br>
Author : Robert Creeley <br><br>

Sixty-two, sixty-three, I most <mark3>remember</mark3><br>
As time W. C. Williams dies and we <mark3>are</mark3><br>
Back from a hard two years in <mark4>Guatemala</mark4><br>
Where the meager provision of <mark4>being</mark4><br>
Schoolmaster for the kids of the patrones <br>
Of two coffee plantations has <mark4>managed</mark4><br>
Neither a life nor money. Leslie dies <mark4>in</mark4><br>
Horror of bank giving way as she and her   <br>
Sister and their friends tunnel in to <mark4>make</mark4><br>
A cubby. We live in an old cement <mark4>brick</mark4><br>
Farmhouse already inside the city <mark4>limits</mark4><br>
Of <mark4>Albuquerque</mark4>, Or that has all <mark4>really</mark4><br>
Happened and we go to Vancouver <mark4>where,</mark4><br>
Thanks to friends Warren and Ellen <mark4>Tallman,</mark4><br>
I get a job teaching at the University of <mark4>British</mark4><br>
Columbia. It's all a curious dream, a <mark4>rush</mark4><br>
To get out of the country before the <mark4>sad</mark4><br>
Invasion of the Bay of <mark4>Pigs</mark4>, that bleak <mark4>use</mark4><br>
Of power. One of my British <mark4>colleagues</mark4><br>
Has converted the assets of himself <mark4>and</mark4><br>
His wife to gold bullion and keeps <mark4>the</mark4><br>
Ingots in a sturdy suitcase pushed <mark3>under</mark3><br>
Their bed. I love the young, at least I   <br>
Think I do, in their freshness, their <mark4>attempt</mark4><br>
To find ways into Canada from the <mark4>western</mark4><br>
<mark4>Reaches</mark4>, Otherwise the local country <mark4>seems</mark4><br>
Like a faded Edwardian sitcom. A <mark4>stunned</mark4><br>
Stoned woman runs one Saturday night <mark4>up</mark4><br>
And down the floors of the Hydro <mark4>Electric</mark4><br>
Building on Pender with the RCMP in <mark4>hot</mark4><br>
Pursuit where otherwise we stood in <mark4>long</mark4><br>
Patient lines, extending often several <mark4>blocks</mark4><br>
Up the street. We were waiting to get <mark4>our</mark4><br>
Hands stamped and to be given a 12 <mark4>pack</mark4><br>
Of Molson's. I think, I dream, I write <mark1>the</mark1><br>
Final few chapters of The Island, the <mark4>despairs</mark4><br>
Gathering at the end. I read Richard Brautigan's   <br>
Trout Fishing In America but am too <mark4>uptight</mark4><br>
To enjoy his quiet, bright <mark4>wit</mark4>, Then <mark4>that</mark4><br>
Summer there is the great Vancouver <mark4>Poetry</mark4><br>
Festival, Allen comes back from India, <mark4>Olson</mark4><br>
From Gloucester, beloved Robert <mark4>Duncan</mark4><br>
From Stinson Beach. Denise reads <mark4>"Hypocrite</mark4><br>
Women" to the Burnaby ladies and Gary <mark4>Snyder,</mark4><br>
Philip Whalen, and Margaret Avison are <mark4>there</mark4><br>
Too along with a veritable host of the <mark4>young.</mark4><br>
Then it's autumn again. I've quit my job   <br>
And we head back to <mark4>Albuquerque</mark4><br>
And I teach again at the university, <mark1>and</mark1><br>
Sometime just about then I must have   <br>
Seen myself as others see or saw me,   <br>
Even like in a mirror, but could not <mark4>quite</mark4><br>
Accept either their reassuring <mark4>friendship</mark4><br>
Or their equally locating anger. <mark4>Selfish,</mark4><br>
Empty, I kept at it. Thirty-eight years <mark4>later</mark4><br>
I seem to myself still much the same,   <br>
Even if I am happier, I think, and <mark4>older.</mark4><br>
