Title : The Curtain <br>
Author : Hayden Carruth <br><br>

Just over the horizon a great machine of death is roaring and rearing. <br>
We can hear it always. Earthquake, starvation, the ever-renewing sump of <mark5>corpse-flesh.</mark5><br>
But in this valley the snow falls silently all day, and out our window <br>
We see the curtain of it shifting and folding, hiding us away in our little <mark4>house,</mark4><br>
We see earth smoothened and beautified, made like a fantasy, the snow-clad <mark4>trees</mark4><br>
So graceful. In our new bed, which is big enough to seem like the north pasture <mark4>almost</mark4><br>
With our two cats, Cooker and Smudgins, lying undisturbed in the southeastern and southwestern <mark4>corners,</mark4><br>
We lie loving and warm, looking out from time to time. "Snowbound," we say. We speak of the <mark4>poet</mark4><br>
Who lived with his young housekeeper long ago in the mountains of the western province, the <mark4>kingdom</mark4><br>
Of cruelty, where heads fell like wilted flowers and snow fell for many <mark4>months</mark4><br>
Across the pass and drifted deep in the vale. In our kitchen the maple-fire <mark4>murmurs</mark4><br>
In our stove. We eat cheese and new-made bread and jumbo Spanish <mark4>olives</mark4><br>
Which have been steeped in our special brine of jalapenos and garlic and dill and <mark4>thyme.</mark4><br>
We have a nip or two from the small inexpensive cognac that makes us smile and sigh.<br>
For a while we close the immense index of images that is our lives--for <mark4>instance,</mark4><br>
The child on the Mescalero reservation in New Mexico sitting naked in 1966 outside his family's <mark4>hut,</mark4><br>
Covered with sores, unable to speak. But of course we see the child every day,<br>
We hold out our hands, we touch him shyly, we make offerings to his implacability.<br>
No, the index cannot close. And how shall we survive? We don't and cannot and will never<br>
Know. Beyond the horizon a great unceasing noise is undeniable. The <mark4>machine,</mark4><br>
Like an immense clanking vibrating shuddering unnameable contraption as big as a house, as big as the whole <mark4>town,</mark4><br>
May break through and lurch into our valley at any <mark1>moment</mark1>, at any <mark4>moment.</mark4><br>
Cheers, baby. Here's to us. See how the curtain of snow wavers and then falls back.<br>
