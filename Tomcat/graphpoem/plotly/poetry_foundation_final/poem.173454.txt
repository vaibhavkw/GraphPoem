Author : John Dryden <br><br>

Excellent In The Two Sister-Arts Of POEsy And Painting: An <mark4>Ode</mark4><br>
<br>
Thou youngest virgin-daughter of the <mark3>skies,</mark3><br>
Made in the last promotion of the <mark3>Blest;</mark3><br>
Whose palms, new pluck'd from <mark4>Paradise,</mark4><br>
In spreading branches more sublimely <mark3>rise,</mark3><br>
Rich with immortal green above the <mark3>rest:</mark3><br>
Whether, adopted to some neighbouring <mark4>star,</mark4><br>
Thou roll'st above <mark4>us</mark4>, in thy wand'ring <mark4>race,</mark4><br>
<mark3>Or</mark3>, in procession fix'd and <mark3>regular,</mark3><br>
Mov'd with the Heavens' majestic <mark3>pace:</mark3><br>
Or, call'd to more superior <mark4>bliss,</mark4><br>
Thou tread'st, with seraphims, the vast <mark3>abyss.</mark3><br>
What ever happy region is thy <mark4>place,</mark4><br>
Cease thy celestial song a little <mark3>space;</mark3><br>
(Thou wilt have time enough for hymns <mark3>divine,</mark3><br>
Since Heav'n's eternal year is <mark3>thine.)</mark3><br>
Hear then a mortal Muse thy praise <mark4>rehearse,</mark4><br>
In no ignoble <mark3>verse;</mark3><br>
But such as thy own voice did practise <mark4>here,</mark4><br>
When thy first fruits of poesy were giv'n;<br>
To make thyself a welcome inmate <mark4>there:</mark4><br>
While yet a young <mark4>probationer,</mark4><br>
                And Candidate of Heav'n.<br>
<br>
If by traduction came thy <mark4>mind,</mark4><br>
Our wonder is the less to <mark3>find</mark3><br>
A soul so charming from a stock so <mark4>good;</mark4><br>
Thy father was transfus'd into thy <mark4>blood:</mark4><br>
So wert thou born into the tuneful <mark4>strain,</mark4><br>
(An early, rich, and inexhausted <mark3>vein.)</mark3><br>
But if thy preexisting <mark3>soul</mark3><br>
Was form'd, at first, with myriads <mark4>more,</mark4><br>
It did through all the mighty poets <mark3>roll,</mark3><br>
Who Greek or Latin laurels <mark3>wore,</mark3><br>
And was that Sappho last, which once it was <mark3>before.</mark3><br>
If so, then cease thy flight, O Heav'n-born <mark1>mind!</mark1><br>
Thou hast no dross to purge from thy rich <mark3>ore:</mark3><br>
Nor can thy soul a fairer mansion <mark1>find,</mark1><br>
Than was the beauteous frame she left <mark3>behind:</mark3><br>
Return, to fill or mend the choir, of thy celestial <mark3>kind.</mark3><br>
May we presume to say, that at thy <mark3>birth,</mark3><br>
<br>
New joy was sprung in Heav'n as well as here on <mark3>earth.</mark3><br>
For sure the milder planets did <mark4>combine</mark4><br>
On thy auspicious horoscope to <mark3>shine,</mark3><br>
And ev'n the most malicious were in <mark3>trine.</mark3><br>
Thy brother-angels at thy <mark1>birth</mark1><br>
Strung each his lyre, and tun'd it <mark3>high,</mark3><br>
That all the people of the <mark3>sky</mark3><br>
Might know a poetess was born on <mark1>earth;</mark1><br>
And then if ever, mortal <mark4>ears</mark4><br>
Had heard the music of the <mark3>spheres!</mark3><br>
And if no clust'ring swarm of <mark4>bees</mark4><br>
On thy sweet mouth distill'd their golden <mark3>dew,</mark3><br>
'Twas that, such vulgar <mark4>miracles,</mark4><br>
Heav'n had not leisure to <mark3>renew:</mark3><br>
For all the blest fraternity of <mark3>love</mark3><br>
Solemniz'd there thy birth, and kept thy Holyday <mark3>above.</mark3><br>
         O Gracious God! How far have we<br>
Profan'd thy Heav'nly gift of poesy?<br>
<br>
Made prostitute and profligate the <mark4>Muse,</mark4><br>
Debas'd to each obscene and impious <mark3>use,</mark3><br>
Whose harmony was first ordain'd <mark1>above</mark1><br>
For tongues of angels, and for hymns of <mark1>love?</mark1><br>
O wretched we! why were we hurried <mark4>down</mark4><br>
This lubrique and adult'rate <mark3>age,</mark3><br>
(Nay added fat pollutions of our <mark4>own)</mark4><br>
T'increase the steaming ordures of the <mark3>stage?</mark3><br>
What can we say t'excuse our Second <mark4>Fall?</mark4><br>
Let this thy vestal, Heav'n, atone for <mark3>all!</mark3><br>
         Her Arethusian stream remains unsoil'd,<br>
         Unmix'd with foreign filth, and undefil'd,<br>
Her wit was more than man, her innocence a <mark4>child!</mark4><br>
Art she had <mark1>none</mark1>, yet wanted <mark4>none:</mark4><br>
For Nature did that want <mark3>supply,</mark3><br>
So rich in treasures of her <mark1>own,</mark1><br>
<br>
She might our boasted stores <mark3>defy:</mark3><br>
Such noble vigour did her verse <mark4>adorn,</mark4><br>
That it seem'd borrow'd, where 'twas only <mark3>born.</mark3><br>
Her morals too were in her bosom <mark4>bred</mark4><br>
By great examples daily <mark3>fed,</mark3><br>
What in the best of Books, her Father's Life, she <mark3>read.</mark3><br>
And to be read her self she need not <mark4>fear,</mark4><br>
Each test, and ev'ry light, her Muse will <mark4>bear,</mark4><br>
Though Epictetus with his lamp were <mark1>there.</mark1><br>
Ev'n love (for love sometimes her Muse <mark4>express'd)</mark4><br>
Was but a lambent-flame which play'd about her <mark3>breast:</mark3><br>
Light as the vapours of a morning <mark3>dream,</mark3><br>
So cold herself, whilst she such warmth <mark1>express'd,</mark1><br>
'Twas Cupid bathing in Diana's <mark3>stream.</mark3><br>
Born to the spacious empire of the <mark4>Nine,</mark4><br>
One would have <mark4>thought</mark4>, she should have been <mark4>content</mark4><br>
To manage well that mighty <mark4>government;</mark4><br>
But what can young ambitious souls <mark3>confine?</mark3><br>
<br>
To the next realm she stretch'd her <mark3>sway,</mark3><br>
For painture near adjoining <mark3>lay,</mark3><br>
A plenteous province, and alluring <mark3>prey.</mark3><br>
A chamber of dependences was <mark4>fram'd,</mark4><br>
(As conquerors will never want <mark5>pretence,</mark5><br>
When <mark4>arm'd</mark4>, to justify <mark4>th'offence)</mark4><br>
And the whole fief, in right of poetry she <mark4>claim'd.</mark4><br>
The country open lay without <mark4>defence:</mark4><br>
For poets frequent inroads there had <mark4>made,</mark4><br>
And perfectly could <mark4>represent</mark4><br>
    The shape, the face, with ev'ry lineament:<br>
And all the large domains which the Dumb-sister <mark4>sway'd,</mark4><br>
All bow'd beneath her <mark1>government,</mark1><br>
Receiv'd in triumph wheresoe'er she <mark4>went,</mark4><br>
Her pencil drew, what e'er her soul <mark4>design'd,</mark4><br>
And oft the happy draught surpass'd the image in her <mark1>mind.</mark1><br>
The sylvan scenes of herds and <mark4>flocks,</mark4><br>
And fruitful plains and barren <mark3>rocks,</mark3><br>
Of shallow brooks that flow'd so <mark4>clear,</mark4><br>
The bottom did the top <mark3>appear;</mark3><br>
Of deeper too and ampler <mark4>floods,</mark4><br>
Which as in <mark4>mirrors</mark4>, show'd the <mark4>woods;</mark4><br>
Of lofty <mark4>trees</mark4>, with sacred <mark4>shades,</mark4><br>
And perspectives of pleasant <mark3>glades,</mark3><br>
Where nymphs of brightest form <mark1>appear,</mark1><br>
And shaggy satyrs standing <mark3>near,</mark3><br>
Which them at once admire and <mark1>fear.</mark1><br>
The ruins too of some majestic <mark4>piece,</mark4><br>
Boasting the pow'r of ancient Rome or <mark3>Greece,</mark3><br>
Whose statues, friezes, columns broken <mark3>lie,</mark3><br>
And tho' defac'd, the wonder of the <mark3>eye,</mark3><br>
What Nature, art, bold fiction e'er durst <mark4>frame,</mark4><br>
Her forming hand gave feature to the <mark3>name.</mark3><br>
So strange a concourse ne'er was seen <mark1>before,</mark1><br>
But when the peopl'd Ark the whole creation <mark3>bore.</mark3><br>
         The scene then chang'd, with bold erected look<br>
Our martial king the sight with reverence <mark5>strook:</mark5><br>
For not content t'express his outward <mark4>part,</mark4><br>
Her hand call'd out the image of his <mark3>heart,</mark3><br>
His warlike mind, his soul devoid of <mark1>fear,</mark1><br>
<br>
His high-designing thoughts, were figur'd <mark1>there,</mark1><br>
As when, by magic, ghosts are made <mark1>appear.</mark1><br>
Our phoenix queen was portray'd too so <mark4>bright,</mark4><br>
Beauty alone could beauty take so <mark3>right:</mark3><br>
Her dress, her shape, her matchless <mark4>grace,</mark4><br>
Were all observ'd, as well as heav'nly <mark3>face.</mark3><br>
With such a peerless majesty she <mark4>stands,</mark4><br>
As in that day she took the crown from sacred <mark3>hands:</mark3><br>
Before a train of heroines was <mark4>seen,</mark4><br>
In beauty foremost, as in rank, the <mark3>queen!</mark3><br>
Thus nothing to her genius was <mark4>deny'd,</mark4><br>
But like a ball of fire the further <mark4>thrown,</mark4><br>
Still with a greater blaze she <mark3>shone,</mark3><br>
And her bright soul broke out on ev'ry <mark4>side.</mark4><br>
What next she had <mark4>design'd</mark4>, Heaven only <mark4>knows,</mark4><br>
To such immod'rate growth her conquest <mark3>rose,</mark3><br>
That fate alone its progress could <mark3>oppose.</mark3><br>
Now all those charms, that blooming <mark1>grace,</mark1><br>
The well-proportion'd shape, and beauteous <mark1>face,</mark1><br>
Shall never more be seen by mortal <mark4>eyes;</mark4><br>
In earth the much lamented virgin <mark3>lies!</mark3><br>
Not <mark4>wit</mark4>, not piety could fate <mark4>prevent;</mark4><br>
Nor was the cruel destiny <mark1>content</mark1><br>
<br>
To finish all the murder at a <mark5>blow,</mark5><br>
To sweep at once her life, and beauty <mark3>too;</mark3><br>
But, like a harden'd felon, took a <mark3>pride</mark3><br>
To work more mischievously <mark3>slow,</mark3><br>
And plunder'd first, and then <mark4>destroy'd.</mark4><br>
O double sacrilege on things <mark1>divine,</mark1><br>
To rob the relique, and deface the <mark3>shrine!</mark3><br>
But thus Orinda <mark3>died:</mark3><br>
Heav'n, by the same disease, did both <mark4>translate,</mark4><br>
As equal were their souls, so equal was their <mark3>fate.</mark3><br>
Meantime her warlike brother on the <mark4>seas</mark4><br>
His waving streamers to the winds <mark4>displays,</mark4><br>
And vows for his return, with vain devotion, <mark3>pays.</mark3><br>
         Ah, generous youth, that wish forbear,<br>
The winds too soon will waft thee <mark1>here!</mark1><br>
Slack all thy sails, and fear to <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
Alas, thou know'st not, thou art wreck'd at <mark4>home!</mark4><br>
<br>
No more shalt thou behold thy sister's <mark1>face,</mark1><br>
Thou hast already had her last <mark3>embrace.</mark3><br>
But look aloft, and if thou ken'st from <mark4>far,</mark4><br>
Among the Pleiad's, a new-kindl'd <mark1>star,</mark1><br>
If any sparkles, than the <mark4>rest</mark4>, more <mark1>bright,</mark1><br>
'Tis she that shines in that propitious <mark3>light.</mark3><br>
When in mid-air, the golden trump shall <mark4>sound,</mark4><br>
To raise the nations under <mark3>ground;</mark3><br>
         When in the valley of Jehosophat,<br>
The Judging God shall close the book of <mark1>fate;</mark1><br>
And there the last Assizes <mark3>keep,</mark3><br>
For those who wake, and those who <mark3>sleep;</mark3><br>
When rattling bones together <mark3>fly,</mark3><br>
From the four corners of the <mark1>sky,</mark1><br>
<br>
When sinews o'er the skeletons are <mark4>spread,</mark4><br>
Those cloth'd with flesh, and life inspires the <mark3>dead;</mark3><br>
The sacred poets first shall hear the <mark1>sound,</mark1><br>
And foremost from the tomb shall <mark3>bound:</mark3><br>
For they are cover'd with the lightest <mark1>ground,</mark1><br>
And straight, with in-born vigour, on the <mark3>wing,</mark3><br>
Like mounting larks, to the new morning <mark3>sing.</mark3><br>
There thou, sweet saint, before the choir shall <mark3>go,</mark3><br>
As harbinger of Heav'n, the way to <mark3>show,</mark3><br>
The way which thou so well hast learn'd <mark3>below.</mark3><br>
