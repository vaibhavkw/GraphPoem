Title : Last Words <br>
Author : Daryl Hine <br><br>

<br>
The telephone keeps talking to <mark4>itself:</mark4><br>
Garbage in the streets, a butterfly, <br>
A rubber raft abandoned, floating out to <mark3>sea,</mark3><br>
And late last night nearby, a <mark4>conflagration--</mark4><br>
If you knew half the secrets I can <mark4>tell,</mark4><br>
The accidents, the threats, the <mark4>promises,</mark4><br>
All anonymous, and the <mark4>voices</mark4><br>
That, like a demoniac, I have: <br>
An unwilling rhyme, a cry for help,   <br>
An order for a pound of stewing <mark4>beef</mark4><br>
And someone begging someone to come <mark4>back--</mark4><br>
All of these proceed from my black mouth,   <br>
All and more are locked in my black <mark4>heart,</mark4><br>
Information, long <mark4>distances</mark4>, wrong <mark4>numbers.</mark4><br>
The clock at first was fast and now has <mark4>stopped</mark4><br>
<br>
That holds all of our lifetimes in its <mark4>hands.</mark4><br>
<br>
"We sleep and wake watched over by <mark4>machines</mark4>, Are <mark4>these</mark4><br>
intelligent objects our servants merely? Are <mark5>they</mark5><br>
our closet masters, maybe? Will we be accomplices and <br>
<br>
equals one <mark3>day?"</mark3><br>
<br>
Tool-and-Die Makers' <mark4>Manual</mark4><br>
                                                      Newly revised, 1964 <br>
The gun, the peppermill, the gramophone,   <br>
The bee, the salamander and the <mark4>swan--</mark4><br>
To be explicit, what have they in <mark4>common?</mark4><br>
<br>
The corkscrew, the stethoscope, the <mark4>laundromat,</mark4><br>
The lyre bird, the python and the <mark3>wombat,</mark3><br>
<br>
How do these differ from the domestic <mark4>cat?</mark4><br>
<br>
Is it a question of theirs and ours or this and <mark3>that?</mark3><br>
What reconciles the wireless and the <mark4>whale?</mark4><br>
Did he who made the lamb invent the <mark4>wheel?</mark4><br>
And what was wisdom doing all the <mark4>while?</mark4><br>
<br>
A catastrophe and a category <mark4>will</mark4><br>
Swallow sardines and supermarkets <mark4>whole.</mark4><br>
But you or rather thou, to be <mark4>archaic,</mark4><br>
Always demanding, never dull but sometimes <mark4>sick,</mark4><br>
<br>
Intimate <mark4>machinery</mark4>, my <mark4>body!</mark4><br>
Whose only raison d'etre is to <mark4>be:</mark4><br>
Your pleasures and your pains are your own <mark4>business;</mark4><br>
Don't ask me for a taste or a <mark4>caress,</mark4><br>
Who, when I weep, weep tear of <mark4>glass,</mark4><br>
<br>
Round and brittle. Your appetites <mark4>embarrass</mark4><br>
<br>
Me. Mine tire you. Old <mark4>Thing,</mark4><br>
The moral is, the moral is, Keep <mark4>going,</mark4><br>
And perhaps we shall meet again at the <mark4>Resurrection--</mark4><br>
The wonder is, what then I shall put <mark4>on?</mark4><br>
