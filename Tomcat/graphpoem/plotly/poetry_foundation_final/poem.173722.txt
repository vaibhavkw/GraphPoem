Title : To Lucy, Countess of Bedford, with John Donne's Satires <br>
Author : Ben Jonson <br><br>

Lucy, you brightness of our <mark4>sphere</mark4>, who <mark4>are</mark4><br>
Life of the Muses' day, their morning <mark3>star!</mark3><br>
If works, not th' author's, their own grace should <mark3>look,</mark3><br>
Whose poems would not wish to be your <mark3>book?</mark3><br>
But these, desir'd by you, the maker's <mark3>ends</mark3><br>
Crown with their own. Rare poems ask rare <mark3>friends.</mark3><br>
Yet satires, since the most of mankind <mark3>be</mark3><br>
Their unavoided subject, fewest <mark3>see;</mark3><br>
For none e'er took that pleasure in sin's sense<br>
But, when they heard it tax'd, took more offence.<br>
They, then, that living where the matter is <mark3>bred,</mark3><br>
Dare for these poems, yet, both ask and <mark3>read</mark3><br>
And like them too, must needfully, though <mark3>few,</mark3><br>
Be of the best; and 'mongst those best are <mark3>you,</mark3><br>
Lucy, you brightness of our <mark4>sphere</mark4>, who <mark1>are</mark1><br>
The Muses' evening, as their morning <mark1>star.</mark1><br>
