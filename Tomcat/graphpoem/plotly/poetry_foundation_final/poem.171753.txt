Title : Persimmons <br>
Author : Li-Young Lee <br><br>

In sixth grade Mrs. <mark4>Walker</mark4><br>
slapped the back of my <mark4>head</mark4><br>
and made me stand in the <mark4>corner</mark4><br>
for not knowing the <mark4>difference</mark4><br>
between persimmon and <mark1>precision.</mark1><br>
How to <mark4>choose</mark4><br>
<br>
persimmons. This is <mark1>precision.</mark1><br>
Ripe ones are soft and <mark4>brown-spotted.</mark4><br>
Sniff the bottoms. The sweet <mark4>one</mark4><br>
will be <mark4>fragrant</mark4>, How to <mark4>eat:</mark4><br>
put the knife away, lay down <mark4>newspaper.</mark4><br>
Peel the skin tenderly, not to tear the <mark3>meat.</mark3><br>
Chew the skin, suck <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
and swallow. Now, <mark1>eat</mark1><br>
the meat of the <mark4>fruit,</mark4><br>
so <mark4>sweet,</mark4><br>
all of <mark4>it</mark4>, to the <mark4>heart.</mark4><br>
<br>
Donna undresses, her stomach is <mark4>white.</mark4><br>
In the yard, dewy and <mark4>shivering</mark4><br>
with crickets, we lie <mark4>naked,</mark4><br>
face-up, <mark4>face-down.</mark4><br>
I teach her <mark4>Chinese.</mark4><br>
Crickets: chiu chiu. Dew: I've <mark4>forgotten.</mark4><br>
Naked:   I've <mark1>forgotten.</mark1><br>
<mark3>Ni</mark3>, wo:   you and <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
I part her <mark4>legs,</mark4><br>
remember to tell <mark3>her</mark3><br>
she is beautiful as the <mark4>moon.</mark4><br>
<br>
Other <mark4>words</mark4><br>
that got me into trouble <mark3>were</mark3><br>
fight and fright, wren and <mark4>yarn.</mark4><br>
Fight was what I did when I was <mark4>frightened,</mark4><br>
Fright was what I felt when I was <mark4>fighting.</mark4><br>
Wrens are small, plain <mark3>birds,</mark3><br>
yarn is what one knits <mark4>with.</mark4><br>
Wrens are soft as <mark1>yarn.</mark1><br>
My mother made birds out of <mark1>yarn.</mark1><br>
I loved to watch her tie the stuff;   <br>
a bird, a rabbit, a wee <mark4>man.</mark4><br>
<br>
Mrs. Walker brought a persimmon to <mark4>class</mark4><br>
and cut it <mark4>up</mark4><br>
so everyone could <mark4>taste</mark4><br>
a Chinese apple. <mark4>Knowing</mark4><br>
it wasn't ripe or <mark3>sweet</mark3>, I didn't <mark1>eat</mark1><br>
but watched the other <mark4>faces.</mark4><br>
<br>
My mother said every persimmon has a <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
inside, something golden, <mark3>glowing,</mark3><br>
warm as my <mark4>face.</mark4><br>
<br>
Once, in the <mark4>cellar</mark4>, I found two wrapped in <mark1>newspaper,</mark1><br>
forgotten and not yet <mark4>ripe.</mark4><br>
I took them and set both on my bedroom windowsill,   <br>
where each morning a <mark4>cardinal</mark4><br>
sang, The <mark1>sun</mark1>, the <mark1>sun.</mark1><br>
<br>
Finally <mark4>understanding</mark4><br>
he was going <mark4>blind,</mark4><br>
my father sat up all one <mark4>night</mark4><br>
waiting for a song, a <mark4>ghost.</mark4><br>
I gave him the <mark5>persimmons,</mark5><br>
swelled, heavy as <mark4>sadness,</mark4><br>
and sweet as <mark1>love.</mark1><br>
<br>
This year, in the muddy <mark4>lighting</mark4><br>
of my parents' cellar, I rummage, <mark4>looking</mark4><br>
for something I <mark4>lost.</mark4><br>
My father sits on the tired, wooden <mark4>stairs,</mark4><br>
black cane between his <mark4>knees,</mark4><br>
hand over hand, gripping the <mark4>handle.</mark4><br>
He's so happy that I've come home. <br>
I ask how his eyes are, a stupid <mark4>question.</mark4><br>
All gone, he <mark4>answers.</mark4><br>
<br>
Under some <mark4>blankets</mark4>, I find a <mark4>box.</mark4><br>
Inside the box I find three <mark4>scrolls.</mark4><br>
I sit beside him and untie <br>
three paintings by my <mark4>father:</mark4><br>
Hibiscus leaf and a white <mark4>flower.</mark4><br>
Two cats <mark4>preening.</mark4><br>
Two persimmons, so full they want to drop from the <mark4>cloth.</mark4><br>
<br>
He raises both hands to touch the <mark1>cloth,</mark1><br>
<mark4>asks</mark4>, Which is <mark4>this?</mark4><br>
<br>
This is persimmons, <mark1>Father.</mark1><br>
<br>
Oh, the feel of the wolftail on the silk,   <br>
the strength, the <mark4>tense</mark4><br>
precision in the <mark4>wrist.</mark4><br>
I painted them hundreds of <mark4>times</mark4><br>
eyes <mark4>closed</mark4>, These I painted <mark1>blind.</mark1><br>
Some things never leave a <mark4>person:</mark4><br>
scent of the hair of one you <mark1>love,</mark1><br>
the texture of <mark1>persimmons,</mark1><br>
in your palm, the ripe <mark4>weight.</mark4><br>
