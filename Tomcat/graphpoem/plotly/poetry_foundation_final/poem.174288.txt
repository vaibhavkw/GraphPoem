Title : My Sister's Sleep <br>
Author : Dante Gabriel Rossetti <br><br>

She fell asleep on Christmas <mark3>Eve:</mark3><br>
At length the long-ungranted <mark4>shade</mark4><br>
         Of weary eyelids overweigh'd<br>
The pain nought else might yet <mark3>relieve.</mark3><br>
<br>
Our mother, who had lean'd all <mark3>day</mark3><br>
Over the bed from chime to <mark3>chime,</mark3><br>
Then rais'd herself for the first <mark3>time,</mark3><br>
And as she sat her down, did <mark3>pray.</mark3><br>
<br>
Her little work-table was <mark4>spread</mark4><br>
With work to finish. For the <mark3>glare</mark3><br>
Made by her candle, she had <mark3>care</mark3><br>
To work some distance from the <mark3>bed.</mark3><br>
<br>
Without, there was a cold moon <mark3>up,</mark3><br>
Of winter radiance sheer and <mark3>thin;</mark3><br>
The hollow halo it was <mark3>in</mark3><br>
Was like an icy crystal <mark3>cup.</mark3><br>
<br>
Through the small room, with subtle <mark4>sound</mark4><br>
Of flame, by vents the fireshine <mark4>drove</mark4><br>
And redden'd. In its dim <mark4>alcove</mark4><br>
The mirror shed a clearness <mark3>round.</mark3><br>
<br>
I had been sitting up some <mark3>nights,</mark3><br>
And my tired mind felt weak and <mark3>blank;</mark3><br>
Like a sharp strengthening wine it <mark3>drank</mark3><br>
The stillness and the broken <mark3>lights.</mark3><br>
<br>
Twelve struck. That sound, by dwindling <mark4>years</mark4><br>
Heard in each hour, crept off; and <mark4>then</mark4><br>
The ruffled silence spread <mark3>again,</mark3><br>
Like water that a pebble <mark4>stirs.</mark4><br>
<br>
Our mother rose from where she <mark3>sat:</mark3><br>
Her needles, as she laid them <mark4>down,</mark4><br>
Met lightly, and her silken <mark3>gown</mark3><br>
Settled: no other noise than <mark3>that.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Glory unto the Newly <mark4>Born!"</mark4><br>
So, as said angels, she did <mark3>say;</mark3><br>
Because we were in Christmas <mark1>Day,</mark1><br>
Though it would still be long till <mark3>morn.</mark3><br>
<br>
Just then in the room over <mark4>us</mark4><br>
There was a pushing back of <mark4>chairs,</mark4><br>
As some who had sat <mark3>unawares</mark3><br>
So late, now heard the hour, and <mark4>rose.</mark4><br>
<br>
With anxious softly-stepping <mark4>haste</mark4><br>
Our mother went where Margaret <mark3>lay,</mark3><br>
Fearing the sounds o'erhead?should <mark3>they</mark3><br>
Have broken her long watch'd-for <mark4>rest!</mark4><br>
<br>
She stoop'd an instant, calm, and <mark4>turn'd;</mark4><br>
But suddenly turn'd back <mark1>again;</mark1><br>
And all her features seem'd in <mark3>pain</mark3><br>
With woe, and her eyes gaz'd and <mark3>yearn'd.</mark3><br>
<br>
For my part, I but hid my <mark4>face,</mark4><br>
And held my breath, and spoke no <mark4>word:</mark4><br>
There was none spoken; but I <mark3>heard</mark3><br>
The silence for a little <mark3>space.</mark3><br>
<br>
Our mother bow'd herself and <mark4>wept:</mark4><br>
And both my arms fell, and I <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
"God knows I knew that she was <mark3>dead."</mark3><br>
And there, all <mark4>white</mark4>, my sister <mark3>slept.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then kneeling, upon Christmas <mark1>morn</mark1><br>
A little after twelve <mark4>o'clock</mark4><br>
We said, ere the first quarter <mark4>struck,</mark4><br>
"Christ's blessing on the newly <mark1>born!"</mark1><br>
