Title : There Came a Soul <br>
Author : Rita Dove <br><br>

After IVAN ALBRIGHT's Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida<br>
She arrived as near to virginal <br>
as girls got in those days--i.e., <mark4>young,</mark4><br>
the requisite dewy <mark4>cheek</mark4><br>
flushed at its own <mark4>daring.</mark4><br>
He had hoped for a little more edge. <br>
But she held the newspaper rolled like a scepter,   <br>
his advertisement turned up to prove <br>
she was there solely at his bidding--and <mark4>yet</mark4><br>
the gold band, the photographs ... a mother, then. <br>
<br>
He placed her in the old garden <mark3>chair,</mark3><br>
the same one he went to <mark4>evenings</mark4><br>
when the first tug on the cord sent the bulb   <br>
swinging like the lamps in the medic's <mark4>tent</mark4><br>
over the <mark4>wounded</mark4>, swaddled shapes that <mark4>moaned</mark4><br>
each time the Screaming Meemies let <mark4>loose,</mark4><br>
their calculated shrieks so far away <br>
he thought of crickets--while all around him   <br>
matted gauze and ether pricked up <br>
an itch so bad he could hardly sketch   <br>
each clean curve of tissue <mark4>opening.</mark4><br>
I shut my eyes, walk straight to <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
Nothing special but it's there, <mark4>wicker</mark4><br>
fraying under my calming <mark4>fingers.</mark4><br>
<br>
What if he changed the newspaper into a <mark4>letter,</mark4><br>
then ripped it up and tucked the best <mark4>part</mark4><br>
from view? How much he needed that <mark4>desecrated</mark4><br>
scrap! And the red comb snarled with a few   <br>
pale hairs for God in his infinite <mark4>greed</mark4><br>
to snatch upon like a hawk targeting a sparrow-- <br>
he couldn't say At least I let you keep your <mark3>hair</mark3><br>
so he kept to his task, applying <mark4>paint</mark4><br>
like a bandage to the open <mark4>wound.</mark4><br>
<br>
Pretty Ida, out to earn a <mark4>penny</mark4><br>
for her tiny <mark4>brood.</mark4><br>
He didn't mask the full <mark4>lips</mark4><br>
or the way all the niggling <mark4>fears</mark4><br>
of an adolescent <mark4>century</mark4><br>
shone through her hesitant <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
but he painted the room out, <mark4>blackened</mark4><br>
every casement, every canvas <mark4>drying</mark4><br>
along the wall, even the ailing coffeepot   <br>
whose dim brew she politely <mark4>refused,</mark4><br>
until she was <mark4>seated</mark4><br>
as he had been, <mark4>dropped</mark4><br>
bleak and <mark4>thick,</mark4><br>
onto the last chair in the <mark4>world.</mark4><br>
