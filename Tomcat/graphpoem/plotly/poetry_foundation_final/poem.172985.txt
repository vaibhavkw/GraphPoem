<br>
WHAT was he doing, the great god <mark3>Pan,</mark3><br>
Down in the reeds by the river <mark1>?</mark1><br>
Spreading ruin and scattering <mark3>ban,</mark3><br>
Splashing and paddling with hoofs of a <mark3>goat,</mark3><br>
And breaking the golden lilies <mark3>afloat</mark3><br>
With the dragon-fly on the <mark1>river.</mark1><br>
<br>
He tore out a reed, the great god <mark1>Pan,</mark1><br>
From the deep cool bed of the river <mark1>:</mark1><br>
The limpid water turbidly <mark3>ran,</mark3><br>
And the broken lilies a-dying <mark3>lay,</mark3><br>
And the dragon-fly had fled <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
Ere he brought it out of the <mark1>river.</mark1><br>
High on the shore sate the great god <mark1>Pan,</mark1><br>
<br>
While turbidly flowed the river <mark1>;</mark1><br>
And hacked and hewed as a great god <mark3>can,</mark3><br>
With his hard bleak steel at the patient <mark3>reed,</mark3><br>
Till there was not a sign of a leaf <mark3>indeed</mark3><br>
To prove it fresh from the <mark1>river.</mark1><br>
He cut it short, did the great god <mark1>Pan,</mark1><br>
(How tall it stood in the river <mark1>!)</mark1><br>
<br>
Then drew the pith, like the heart of a <mark3>man,</mark3><br>
Steadily from the outside <mark3>ring,</mark3><br>
And notched the poor dry empty <mark3>thing</mark3><br>
In holes, as he sate by the <mark1>river.</mark1><br>
This is the way,' laughed the great god <mark1>Pan,</mark1><br>
Laughed while he sate by the <mark1>river,)</mark1><br>
The only way, since gods <mark3>began</mark3><br>
<br>
To make sweet music, they could <mark3>succeed.'</mark3><br>
Then, dropping his mouth to a hole in the <mark1>reed,</mark1><br>
He blew in power by the <mark1>river.</mark1><br>
Sweet, sweet, sweet, O Pan <mark1>!</mark1><br>
Piercing sweet by the river <mark1>!</mark1><br>
Blinding sweet, O great god Pan <mark1>!</mark1><br>
The sun on the hill forgot to <mark3>die,</mark3><br>
<br>
And the lilies revived, and the <mark3>dragon-fly</mark3><br>
Came back to dream on the <mark1>river.</mark1><br>
Yet half a beast is the great god <mark1>Pan,</mark1><br>
To laugh as he sits by the <mark1>river,</mark1><br>
Making a poet out of a man <mark1>:</mark1><br>
The true gods sigh for the cost and pain, <mark4>--</mark4><br>
For the reed which grows nevermore <mark3>again</mark3><br>
<br>
As a reed with the reeds in the <mark1>river.</mark1><br>
