Title : kitchenette building <br>
Author : Gwendolyn Brooks <br><br>

We are things of dry hours and the involuntary <mark3>plan,</mark3><br>
Grayed in, and gray. "Dream" makes a giddy sound, not strong<br>
Like "rent," "feeding a wife," "satisfying a <mark3>man."</mark3><br>
<br>
But could a dream send up through onion <mark4>fumes</mark4><br>
Its white and violet, fight with fried <mark4>potatoes</mark4><br>
And yesterday's garbage ripening in the hall,<br>
Flutter, or sing an ariaaria an elaborate song for one voice with orchestral accompaniment, appearing most often in opera ("aria" means "air" in Italian). down these <mark4>rooms</mark4><br>
<br>
Even if we were willing to let it <mark4>in,</mark4><br>
Had time to warm it, keep it very <mark4>clean,</mark4><br>
Anticipate a message, let it <mark4>begin?</mark4><br>
<br>
We wonder. But not well! not for a <mark4>minute!</mark4><br>
Since Number Five is out of the bathroom now,<br>
We think of lukewarm water, hope to get in <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
