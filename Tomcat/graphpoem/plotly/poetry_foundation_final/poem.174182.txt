Title : Portrait d'une Femme <br>
Author : Ezra Pound <br><br>

Your mind and you are our Sargasso <mark3>Sea,</mark3><br>
London has swept about you this score <mark4>years</mark4><br>
And bright ships left you this or that in <mark3>fee:</mark3><br>
Ideas, old gossip, oddments of all <mark4>things,</mark4><br>
Strange spars of knowledge and dimmed wares of <mark4>price.</mark4><br>
Great minds have sought you -- lacking someone <mark4>else.</mark4><br>
You have been second always. Tragical? <br>
No. You preferred it to the usual <mark5>thing:</mark5><br>
One dull man, dulling and uxorious, <br>
One average mind --   with one thought less, each <mark5>year.</mark5><br>
Oh, you are <mark4>patient</mark4>, I have seen you <mark4>sit</mark4><br>
Hours, where something might have floated <mark4>up.</mark4><br>
And now you pay one.   Yes, you richly <mark3>pay.</mark3><br>
You are a person of some interest, one comes to <mark3>you</mark3><br>
And takes strange gain <mark3>away:</mark3><br>
Trophies fished up; some curious <mark4>suggestion;</mark4><br>
Fact that leads nowhere; and a tale for <mark3>two,</mark3><br>
Pregnant with mandrakes, or with something <mark1>else</mark1><br>
That might prove useful and yet never <mark4>proves,</mark4><br>
That never fits a corner or shows <mark4>use,</mark4><br>
Or finds its hour upon the loom of <mark4>days:</mark4><br>
      The tarnished, gaudy, wonderful old work; <br>
Idols and ambergris and rare inlays, <br>
These are your riches, your great store; and <mark4>yet</mark4><br>
For all this sea-hoard of deciduous <mark1>things,</mark1><br>
      Strange woods half sodden, and new brighter stuff: <br>
In the slow float of differing light and <mark4>deep,</mark4><br>
      No! there is nothing! In the whole and all, <br>
Nothing that's quite your <mark4>own.</mark4><br>
Yet this is <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
