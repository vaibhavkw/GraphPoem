Title : Of the Last Verses in the Book <br>
Author : Edmund Waller <br><br>

When we for age could neither read nor <mark3>write,</mark3><br>
The subject made us able to <mark3>indite.</mark3><br>
The soul, with nobler resolutions <mark5>deckt,</mark5><br>
The body stooping, does herself <mark4>erect:</mark4><br>
No mortal parts are requisite to <mark3>raise</mark3><br>
Her, that unbodied can her Maker <mark3>praise.</mark3><br>
<br>
The seas are quiet, when the winds give <mark4>o'er,</mark4><br>
So calm are we, when passions are no more:<br>
For then we know how vain it was to <mark4>boast</mark4><br>
Of fleeting things, so certain to be <mark4>lost.</mark4><br>
Clouds of affection from our younger <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
Conceal that emptiness, which age descries.<br>
<br>
The soul's dark cottage, batter'd and <mark4>decay'd,</mark4><br>
Lets in new light through chinks that time has made;<br>
Stronger by weakness, wiser men <mark4>become</mark4><br>
As they draw near to their eternal <mark4>home:</mark4><br>
Leaving the old, both worlds at once they <mark3>view,</mark3><br>
That stand upon the threshold of the <mark3>new.</mark3><br>
