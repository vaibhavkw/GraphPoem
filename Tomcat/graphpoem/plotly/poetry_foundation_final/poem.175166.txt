Title : The Day is Done <br>
Author : Henry Wadsworth Longfellow <br><br>

The day is done, and the <mark4>darkness</mark4><br>
Falls from the wings of <mark3>Night,</mark3><br>
As a feather is wafted downward <br>
From an eagle in his <mark3>flight.</mark3><br>
<br>
I see the lights of the village <br>
Gleam through the rain and the <mark4>mist,</mark4><br>
And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me <br>
That my soul cannot <mark3>resist:</mark3><br>
<br>
A feeling of sadness and <mark4>longing,</mark4><br>
That is not akin to <mark3>pain,</mark3><br>
And resembles sorrow only <br>
As the mist resembles the <mark3>rain.</mark3><br>
<br>
<mark4>Come</mark4>, read to me some <mark4>poem,</mark4><br>
Some simple and heartfelt <mark3>lay,</mark3><br>
That shall soothe this restless <mark4>feeling,</mark4><br>
And banish the thoughts of <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
<br>
Not from the grand old <mark4>masters,</mark4><br>
Not from the bards <mark4>sublime,</mark4><br>
Whose distant footsteps echo <br>
Through the corridors of <mark3>Time.</mark3><br>
<br>
For, like strains of martial <mark1>music,</mark1><br>
Their mighty thoughts <mark4>suggest</mark4><br>
Life's endless toil and <mark4>endeavor;</mark4><br>
And to-night I long for <mark3>rest.</mark3><br>
<br>
Read from some humbler <mark4>poet,</mark4><br>
Whose songs gushed from his <mark4>heart,</mark4><br>
As showers from the clouds of <mark4>summer,</mark4><br>
Or tears from the eyelids <mark3>start;</mark3><br>
<br>
Who, through long days of <mark4>labor,</mark4><br>
And nights devoid of <mark4>ease,</mark4><br>
Still heard in his soul the <mark1>music</mark1><br>
Of wonderful <mark4>melodies.</mark4><br>
<br>
Such songs have power to <mark4>quiet</mark4><br>
The restless pulse of <mark3>care,</mark3><br>
And come like the <mark4>benediction</mark4><br>
That follows after <mark3>prayer.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then read from the treasured <mark4>volume</mark4><br>
The poem of thy <mark4>choice,</mark4><br>
And lend to the rhyme of the <mark1>poet</mark1><br>
The beauty of thy <mark3>voice.</mark3><br>
<br>
And the night shall be filled with <mark1>music,</mark1><br>
And the cares, that infest the <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
Shall fold their tents, like the <mark4>Arabs,</mark4><br>
And as silently steal <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
