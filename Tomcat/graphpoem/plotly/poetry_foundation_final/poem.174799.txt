Title : Most Sweet it is <br>
Author : William Wordsworth <br><br>

<br>
Most sweet it is with unuplifted <mark3>eyes</mark3><br>
To pace the ground, if path be there or <mark4>none,</mark4><br>
While a fair region round the traveller <mark3>lies</mark3><br>
Which he forbears again to look <mark4>upon;</mark4><br>
Pleased rather with some soft ideal <mark4>scene,</mark4><br>
The work of Fancy, or some happy <mark4>tone</mark4><br>
Of <mark4>meditation</mark4>, slipping in <mark4>between</mark4><br>
The beauty coming and the beauty <mark4>gone.</mark4><br>
If Thought and Love desert us, from that <mark3>day</mark3><br>
Let us break off all commerce with the <mark4>Muse:</mark4><br>
With Thought and Love companions of our <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
Whate'er the senses take or may <mark3>refuse,</mark3><br>
The Mind's internal heaven shall shed her <mark3>dews</mark3><br>
Of inspiration on the humblest <mark3>lay.</mark3><br>
