Title : The Virgin <br>
Author : William Wordsworth <br><br>

<br>
Mother! whose virgin bosom was uncrost<br>
With the least shade of thought to sin <mark3>allied.</mark3><br>
Woman! above all women <mark3>glorified,</mark3><br>
Our tainted nature's solitary <mark3>boast;</mark3><br>
Purer than foam on central ocean tost;<br>
Brighter than eastern skies at daybreak <mark3>strewn</mark3><br>
With fancied roses, than the unblemished <mark3>moon</mark3><br>
Before her wane begins on heaven's blue <mark3>coast;</mark3><br>
Thy image falls to earth. Yet some, I ween,<br>
Not unforgiven the suppliant knee might <mark4>bend,</mark4><br>
As to a visible Power, in which did <mark3>blend</mark3><br>
All that was mixed and reconciled in thee<br>
Of mother's love with maiden purity,<br>
Of high with low, celestial with terrene!<br>
