Title : Stopping <br>
Author : Woods on a Snowy Evening <br><br>

Whose woods these are I think I <mark3>know.</mark3><br>
His house is in the village <mark3>though;</mark3><br>
He will not see me stopping <mark4>here</mark4><br>
To watch his woods fill up with <mark3>snow.</mark3><br>
<br>
My little horse must think it <mark4>queer</mark4><br>
To stop without a farmhouse <mark3>near</mark3><br>
Between the woods and frozen <mark3>lake</mark3><br>
The darkest evening of the <mark3>year.</mark3><br>
<br>
He gives his harness bells a <mark3>shake</mark3><br>
To ask if there is some <mark3>mistake.</mark3><br>
The only other sound's the <mark3>sweep</mark3><br>
Of easy wind and downy <mark3>flake.</mark3><br>
<br>
The woods are lovely, dark and <mark3>deep,</mark3><br>
But I have promises to <mark3>keep,</mark3><br>
And miles to go before I <mark3>sleep,</mark3><br>
And miles to go before I <mark1>sleep.</mark1><br>
