Title : On This Rock <br>
Author : Daryl Hine <br><br>

Mountains rise above us like <mark4>ideas</mark4><br>
Vague in their superior <mark4>extent,</mark4><br>
Part of the range of <mark4>disillusionment</mark4><br>
Whose arresting outline <mark4>disappears</mark4><br>
Into the circumstantial clouds that <mark3>look</mark3><br>
Like footnotes from above. What wisdom <mark3>said</mark3><br>
The mind has mountains? Imagination <mark3>read</mark3><br>
The history of the world there like a <mark3>book.</mark3><br>
<br>
Playing peek-a-boo with famous <mark4>peaks</mark4><br>
Afflicted with the vapours leaves a <mark4>sense,</mark4><br>
Frowned down upon by all that bleak <mark3>immense</mark3><br>
City of rock and <mark4>ice</mark4>, that men are <mark4>freaks,</mark4><br>
In the original program of <mark3>creation,</mark3><br>
Afterthoughts. Each jack pine seems a <mark3>brother;</mark3><br>
Even in lichens we perceive <mark3>another</mark3><br>
Example of our own <mark3>organization,</mark3><br>
<br>
Tenacious, patient, in a <mark4>century</mark4><br>
Growing perhaps a quarter-of-an-inch: <br>
Glaciers do more daily, an avalanche <br>
In minutes. The eroded <mark4>immobility</mark4><br>
Attributed to mountains is a <mark3>fable,</mark3><br>
Like the Great Divide. They move when you're not <mark5>looking,</mark5><br>
Like stars and stocks, distinctly better <mark1>looking</mark1><br>
From a distance, and chronically <mark3>unstable.</mark3><br>
