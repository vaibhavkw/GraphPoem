Title : Sudden Light <br>
Author : Dante Gabriel Rossetti <br><br>

I have been here <mark3>before,</mark3><br>
But when or how I cannot <mark3>tell:</mark3><br>
I know the grass beyond the <mark3>door,</mark3><br>
The sweet keen <mark3>smell,</mark3><br>
The sighing sound, the lights around the <mark3>shore.</mark3><br>
<br>
You have been mine <mark1>before,--</mark1><br>
How long ago I may not <mark3>know:</mark3><br>
But just when at that swallow's <mark3>soar</mark3><br>
Your neck turn'd <mark3>so,</mark3><br>
Some veil did fall,--I knew it all of <mark3>yore.</mark3><br>
<br>
Has this been thus <mark1>before?</mark1><br>
And shall not thus time's eddying <mark3>flight</mark3><br>
Still with our lives our love <mark3>restore</mark3><br>
In death's <mark3>despite,</mark3><br>
And day and night yield one delight once <mark3>more?</mark3><br>
