Title : "Do Not Embrace Your Mind's New Negro Friend" <br>
Author : William Meredith <br><br>

Do not embrace your mind's new negro <mark1>friend</mark1><br>
Or embarrass the blackballed jew with <mark4>memberships:</mark4><br>
There must be years of atonement first, and even then <br>
You may still be the blundering raconteur <br>
With the wrong story, and they may still be free. <br>
<br>
If you are with them, if even mind is <mark1>friend,</mark1><br>
There will be plenty to do: give the liars <mark4>lessons</mark4><br>
Who have heard no rumors of truth for a long time <br>
But have whatever they hear on good authority, <br>
Whether it concerns Chinese women or the <mark4>arts.</mark4><br>
<br>
Expose the <mark4>patrons</mark4>, some of whose best <mark4>friends</mark4><br>
Are brothers, and who are never now <mark4>anonymous:</mark4><br>
What kind of credit do they expect for <mark4>that,</mark4><br>
Ask them, or better, ask their protested <mark4>brothers,</mark4><br>
The grateful tenants who can't get their curtsies <mark4>right.</mark4><br>
<br>
Finally the <mark4>injured</mark4>, who think they have no <mark1>friend,</mark1><br>
Who have been convinced by the repeated <mark4>names</mark4><br>
That they are jews or negroes or some dark thing: <br>
They must be courted with the lover's touch <br>
And as guiltily as if yourself had turned them <mark4>inward.</mark4><br>
<br>
If you complete this program, you will have <mark1>friends</mark1><br>
From all the rich races of your human <mark4>blood:</mark4><br>
Meantime, engage in the often friendless struggle. <br>
A long war, a pygmy war in <mark4>ways,</mark4><br>
But island by island we must go <mark4>across.</mark4><br>
