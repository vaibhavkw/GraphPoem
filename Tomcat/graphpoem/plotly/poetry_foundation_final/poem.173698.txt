Title : Abou Ben Adhem <br>
Author : Leigh Hunt <br><br>

Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe <mark3>increase!)</mark3><br>
Awoke one night from a deep dream of <mark3>peace,</mark3><br>
And saw, within the moonlight in his <mark3>room,</mark3><br>
Making it rich, and like a lily in <mark3>bloom,</mark3><br>
An angel writing in a book of <mark3>gold:?</mark3><br>
Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem <mark3>bold,</mark3><br>
And to the presence in the room he <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
"What writest thou?"?The vision raised its <mark3>head,</mark3><br>
And with a look made of all sweet <mark4>accord,</mark4><br>
<mark4>Answered</mark4>, "The names of those who love the <mark3>Lord."</mark3><br>
"And is mine one?" said Abou. "Nay, not <mark3>so,"</mark3><br>
Replied the angel. Abou spoke more <mark3>low,</mark3><br>
But cheerly still; and said, "I pray thee, <mark3>then,</mark3><br>
Write me as one that loves his fellow <mark3>men."</mark3><br>
<br>
The angel wrote, and <mark4>vanished</mark4>, The next <mark4>night</mark4><br>
It came again with a great wakening <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
And showed the names whom love of God had <mark4>blest,</mark4><br>
And lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the <mark3>rest.</mark3><br>
