Title : Clothes <br>
Author : Edgar Bowers <br><br>

Walking back to the office after <mark4>lunch,</mark4><br>
I saw Hans. "Mister <mark1>Isham</mark1>, Mister <mark1>Isham,"</mark1><br>
He called out in his hurry, "Herr Wegner needs <mark3>you.</mark3><br>
A woman waiting for a border <mark4>pass</mark4><br>
Took poison, she is dead, and the <mark4>police</mark4><br>
Are there to take the body." In the <mark4>hall,</mark4><br>
The secretaries stood outside their <mark4>doors</mark4><br>
Silently waiting with Wegner. "Sir," he <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
"It was her answer on the <mark4>questionnaire,</mark4><br>
A clerk for the Gestapo. So it <mark4>was."</mark4><br>
Within the outer office, by the row<br>
Of wooden chairs, one lying on its <mark4>side,</mark4><br>
On the discolored brown linoleum <mark4>floor</mark4><br>
Under a GI blanket was the <mark4>lost</mark4><br>
Unmoving shape; <mark4>uncovered</mark4>, from a <mark4>fold,</mark4><br>
A dirty foot half out of a dirty <mark3>shoe,</mark3><br>
Once white, heel bent, the sole worn through, the <mark4>skin</mark4><br>
Bruised red and calloused, uncut toenails <mark4>curved</mark4><br>
And veined like an old ivory. No one <mark4>spoke.</mark4><br>
Police stood at attention by a stretcher. <br>
After an empty moment, suddenly<br>
Bent over as if taken by a cramp,<br>
I sobbed out loud and, on my <mark4>uniform,</mark4><br>
Vomited up my lunch?over the tie,<br>
The polished buttons and insignia,<br>
The little strips of color and the <mark4>green</mark4><br>
Eisenhower jacket with its Eagle <mark4>patch,</mark4><br>
The taut pants in a <mark4>crease</mark4>, the glistening <mark4>jump-boots?</mark4><br>
Vomiting and still sobbing, like a <mark4>child</mark4><br>
Awakened in the night, and sick. Wegner and <mark4>Hans</mark4><br>
Held me, murmuring, "Ach, dear sir, the <mark3>war</mark3><br>
Is over and not over, such things <mark4>happen."</mark4><br>
While no one else moved, Frau Schmidt brought a <mark4>towel</mark4><br>
To clean me off before Hans walked me <mark4>back,</mark4><br>
My arm across his shoulders and I retelling <br>
The story of how, near Zell am See, we <mark4>found,</mark4><br>
Hung from a tree in leaf, the final <mark3>sack</mark3><br>
Of bones, in rotted Wehrmacht green. In the <mark4>house</mark4><br>
An SS lord had furnished for his <mark4>mistress?</mark4><br>
Deep sofas, Persian rugs, and velvet <mark4>drapes?</mark4><br>
Frau Konig took my clothes. In my own <mark4>room,</mark4><br>
Wearing the Gucci robe Bouchard had <mark4>taken</mark4><br>
From a fine house before we got to <mark4>Ulm,</mark4><br>
Instead of lying down to rest, I <mark4>studied</mark4><br>
The book I read for German with Frau <mark4>Schmidt,</mark4><br>
Goethe's Italian Journey. Through the window,<br>
The Watchman's upper slopes were shadows, <mark1>green</mark1><br>
And purple with the afternoon, its <mark4>snows</mark4><br>
Melting, its double peaks the victory <mark4>sign.</mark4><br>
