Title : Learning from History <br>
Author : David Ferry <br><br>

They said, my saints, my slogan-sayers <mark4>sang,</mark4><br>
Be good, my child, in spite of all <mark3>alarm.</mark3><br>
<br>
They stood, my fathers, tall in a row and <mark3>said,</mark3><br>
Be good, be brave, you shall not come to <mark3>harm.</mark3><br>
<br>
I heard them in my sleep and muttering <mark4>dream,</mark4><br>
And murmuring cried, How shall I wake to this? <br>
<br>
They said, my poets, singers of my <mark4>song,</mark4><br>
We cannot tell, since all we tell you is <br>
<br>
But history, we speak but of the <mark3>dead.</mark3><br>
And of the dead they said such <mark3>history</mark3><br>
<br>
(Their beards were blazing with the truth of it)   <br>
As made of much of me a <mark3>mystery.</mark3><br>
