Title : The Healing Improvisation of Hair <br>
Author : Jay Wright <br><br>

If you undo your do you <mark4>would</mark4><br>
be strange. Hair has been on my <mark4>mind.</mark4><br>
I used to lean in the doorway <br>
and watch my stony woman <mark3>wind</mark3><br>
the copper through the black, and play <br>
with my understanding, show me she <mark4>could</mark4><br>
take a cup of river <mark4>water,</mark4><br>
and watch it shimmy, watch it <mark3>change,</mark3><br>
turn around and become ash <mark3>bone.</mark3><br>
Wind in the cottonwoods wakes <mark3>me</mark3><br>
to a day so thin its breastbone   <br>
shows, so paid out it shakes me <mark3>free</mark3><br>
of its blue dust. I will <mark3>arrange</mark3><br>
that river water, bottom <mark4>juice.</mark4><br>
I conjure my head in the <mark3>stream</mark3><br>
and ride with the silk feel of <mark3>it</mark3><br>
as my woman bathes me, and shaves   <br>
away the scorn, sponges the <mark3>grit</mark3><br>
of solitude from my skin, laves   <br>
the salt water of <mark3>self-esteem</mark3><br>
over my feathering body. <br>
How like joy to come upon <mark1>me</mark1><br>
in remembering a head of <mark3>hair</mark3><br>
and the way water would <mark4>caress</mark4><br>
it, and stress beauty in the <mark3>flair</mark3><br>
and cut of the only <mark4>witness</mark4><br>
to my dance under sorrow's <mark3>tree.</mark3><br>
This swift darkness is spring's first <mark4>hour.</mark4><br>
<br>
I carried my life, like a <mark3>stone,</mark3><br>
in a ragged pocket, but <mark3>I</mark3><br>
had a true weaving song, a <mark3>sly</mark3><br>
way with rhythm, a healing <mark3>tone.</mark3><br>
