This admirable gadget, when it <mark4>is</mark4><br>
Wound on a string and spun with steady <mark4>force,</mark4><br>
Maintains its balance on most any smooth <br>
Surface, pleasantly humming as it <mark4>goes.</mark4><br>
It is whirled not on a constant course, but <mark1>still</mark1><br>
Stands in unshivering <mark4>integrity</mark4><br>
For quite some time, meaning nothing <mark4>perhaps</mark4><br>
But being something agreeable to watch,   <br>
A silver nearly silence gleaning a <mark1>still-</mark1><br>
ness out of speed, composing <mark4>unity</mark4><br>
From spin, so that its hollow spaces seem   <br>
Solids of light, until it wobbles and   <br>
Begins to whine, and then with an odd lunge   <br>
Eccentric and reckless, it skids away   <br>
And drops dead into its own skeleton.<br>
