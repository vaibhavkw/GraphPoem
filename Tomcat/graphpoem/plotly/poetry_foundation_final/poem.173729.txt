Title : Song: to Celia ["Drink to me only with thine eyes"] <br>
Author : Ben Jonson <br><br>

Drink to me only with thine <mark3>eyes,</mark3><br>
And I will pledge with <mark3>mine;</mark3><br>
Or leave a kiss but in the <mark3>cup,</mark3><br>
And I'll not look for <mark3>wine.</mark3><br>
The thirst that from the soul doth <mark3>rise</mark3><br>
Doth ask a drink <mark3>divine;</mark3><br>
But might I of Jove's nectar <mark3>sup,</mark3><br>
I would not change for <mark3>thine.</mark3><br>
<br>
I sent thee late a rosy wreath, <br>
Not so much honouring <mark5>thee</mark5><br>
As giving it a hope, that <mark5>there</mark5><br>
It could not withered <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
But thou thereon didst only breathe, <br>
And sent'st it back to <mark3>me;</mark3><br>
Since when it grows, and smells, I <mark3>swear,</mark3><br>
Not of itself, but <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
