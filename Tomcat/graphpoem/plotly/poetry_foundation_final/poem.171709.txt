Title : Ex Libris <br>
Author : Eleanor Wilner <br><br>

By the stream, where the ground is <mark4>soft</mark4><br>
and gives, under the slightest pressure--even   <br>
the fly would leave its footprint here   <br>
and the paw of the shrew the <mark4>crescent</mark4><br>
of its claws like the strokes of a <mark4>chisel</mark4><br>
in clay; where the lightest chill, <mark4>lighter</mark4><br>
than the least rumor of winter, sets the <mark4>reeds</mark4><br>
to a kind of speaking, and a single drop of rain   <br>
leaves a crater to catch the first <mark4>silver</mark4><br>
glint of sun when the clouds slide away   <br>
from each other like two tired <mark4>lovers,</mark4><br>
and the light returns, pale, though <mark4>brightened</mark4><br>
by the last chapter of late <mark4>autumn:</mark4><br>
copper, rusted oak, gold aspen, and the <mark4>red</mark4><br>
pages of maple, the wind leafing through to the <mark4>end</mark4><br>
the annals of beech, the slim <mark4>volumes</mark4><br>
of birch, the elegant script of the ferns <mark4>...</mark4><br>
<br>
for the birds, it is <mark4>all</mark4><br>
notations for a coda, for the <mark4>otter</mark4><br>
an invitation to the <mark4>river,</mark4><br>
and for the deer--a <mark4>dream</mark4><br>
in which to disappear, <mark4>light-footed</mark4><br>
on the still open book of earth,   <br>
adding the marks of their passage,   <br>
adding it all in, waiting only <br>
for the first thick flurry of snowflakes   <br>
for cover, soft cover that <mark4>carries</mark4><br>
no title, no <mark4>name.</mark4><br>
