Title : The City's Oldest Known Survivor of the Great War <br>
Author : James Doyle <br><br>

marches in uniform down the traffic <mark5>stripe</mark5><br>
at the center of the street, counts <mark4>time</mark4><br>
to the unseen web that has <mark4>rearranged</mark4><br>
the air around him, his left <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
stiff as a leather strap along his <mark4>side,</mark4><br>
the other saluting right through the <mark4>decades</mark4><br>
as if they weren't there, as if everyone under <mark4>ninety</mark4><br>
were pervasive fog the morning would dispel <br>
in its own good time, as if the high school <mark4>band</mark4><br>
all flapping thighs and cuffs behind <mark4>him</mark4><br>
were as ghostly as the tumbleweed on every <mark4>road</mark4><br>
dead-ended in the present, all the ancient <mark4>infantry</mark4><br>
shoulder right, through a skein of bone, presenting <mark4>arms</mark4><br>
across the drift, nothing but empty graves now <br>
to round off another <mark4>century,</mark4><br>
the sweet honey of the old <mark4>cadence</mark4>, the <mark5>streets</mark5><br>
going by at attention, the banners glistening with dew, <br>
the wives and children blowing <mark4>kisses.</mark4><br>
