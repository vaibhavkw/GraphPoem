Title : Captivity <br>
Author : Louise Erdrich <br><br>

He (my captor) gave me a bisquit, which I put in my pocket, and not daring to eat it, buried it under a log, fearing he had put something in it to make me love him.<br>
--From the narrative of the captivity of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson, who was taken prisoner by the Wampanoag when Lancaster, Massachusetts, was destroyed, in the year 1676<br>
<br>
The stream was swift, and so <mark4>cold</mark4><br>
I thought I would be sliced in two.   <br>
But he dragged me from the <mark4>flood</mark4><br>
by the ends of my <mark4>hair.</mark4><br>
I had grown to recognize his <mark4>face.</mark4><br>
I could distinguish it from the <mark4>others.</mark4><br>
There were times I feared I <mark4>understood</mark4><br>
his language, which was not <mark4>human,</mark4><br>
and I knelt to pray for <mark4>strength.</mark4><br>
<br>
We were pursued by God's <mark4>agents</mark4><br>
or pitch devils, I did not know. <br>
Only that we must <mark4>march.</mark4><br>
Their guns were loaded with swan <mark4>shot.</mark4><br>
I could not suckle and my child's <mark4>wail</mark4><br>
put them in <mark4>danger.</mark4><br>
He had a <mark4>woman</mark4><br>
with teeth black and glittering.   <br>
She fed the child milk of <mark4>acorns.</mark4><br>
The forest <mark4>closed</mark4>, the light <mark4>deepened.</mark4><br>
<br>
I told myself that I would <mark1>starve</mark1><br>
before I took food from his <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
but I did not <mark1>starve.</mark1><br>
One <mark4>night</mark4><br>
he killed a deer with a young one in her   <br>
and gave me to eat of the <mark4>fawn.</mark4><br>
It was so <mark4>tender,</mark4><br>
the bones like the stems of <mark4>flowers,</mark4><br>
that I followed where he took <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
The night was thick. He cut the <mark4>cord</mark4><br>
that bound me to the <mark3>tree.</mark3><br>
<br>
After that the birds <mark4>mocked.</mark4><br>
Shadows gaped and <mark3>roared</mark3><br>
and the trees flung <mark4>down</mark4><br>
their sharpened <mark4>lashes.</mark4><br>
He did not notice God's <mark4>wrath.</mark4><br>
God blasted fire from half-buried <mark4>stumps.</mark4><br>
I hid my face in my dress, fearing He would burn us <mark4>all</mark4><br>
but this, too, <mark4>passed.</mark4><br>
<br>
Rescued, I see no truth in <mark4>things.</mark4><br>
My husband drives a thick wedge   <br>
through the earth, still it <mark4>shuts</mark4><br>
to him year after <mark4>year.</mark4><br>
My child is fed of the first <mark4>wheat.</mark4><br>
I lay myself to <mark1>sleep</mark1><br>
on a Holland-laced pillowbeer.   <br>
I lay to <mark1>sleep.</mark1><br>
And in the dark I see myself   <br>
as I was outside their <mark4>circle.</mark4><br>
<br>
They knelt on deerskins, some with <mark4>sticks,</mark4><br>
and he led his company in the <mark4>noise</mark4><br>
until I could no longer <mark4>bear</mark4><br>
the thought of how I <mark4>was.</mark4><br>
I stripped a <mark4>branch</mark4><br>
and struck the <mark4>earth,</mark4><br>
in time, begging it to <mark4>open</mark4><br>
to admit <mark1>me</mark1><br>
as he <mark1>was</mark1><br>
and feed me honey from the rock.<br>
