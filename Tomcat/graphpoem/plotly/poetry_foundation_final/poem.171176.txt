Title : Humidifier <br>
Author : Louise Gluck <br><br>

?After Robert <mark4>Pinsky</mark4><br>
Defier of closed space, such as the head, <mark4>opener</mark4><br>
Of the sealed passageways, so <mark4>that</mark4><br>
Sunlight entering the nose can once <mark4>again</mark4><br>
<br>
Exit the ear, vaporizer, mist machine, <mark4>whose</mark4><br>
Soft hiss sounds like another human <mark1>being</mark1><br>
<br>
But less erratic, more stable, or, if not like a human <mark1>being,</mark1><br>
Carried by one, by my mother to the sick <mark4>chamber</mark4><br>
Of my childhood ? as Freud <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
<br>
Why are you always sick, Louise? his <mark4>cigar</mark4><br>
Confusing mist with smoke, <mark4>interfering</mark4><br>
With healing?Embodied <br>
<br>
Summoner of these ghosts, white plastic tub with your <mark4>elegant</mark4><br>
Clear tub, the water sanitized by <mark4>boiling,</mark4><br>
Sterile, <mark4>odorless,</mark4><br>
<br>
In my mother's <mark4>absence</mark4><br>
Run by me, the one <mark4>machine</mark4><br>
<br>
I understand: <mark4>what</mark4><br>
Would life be if we could not buy <br>
Objects to care for <mark4>us</mark4><br>
<br>
And bear them home, away from the druggists' <mark4>pity,</mark4><br>
If we could not carry in our own <mark4>arms</mark4><br>
Alms, alchemy, to the safety of our <mark4>bedrooms,</mark4><br>
If there were no <mark4>more</mark4><br>
<br>
Sounds in the night, <mark4>continuous</mark4><br>
Hush, hush of warm steam, <mark4>not</mark4><br>
Like human breath though regular, if there were nothing in the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
<br>
More hopeful than the self, <br>
Soothing it, wishing it well. <br>
