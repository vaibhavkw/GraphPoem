Title : See It Through <br>
Author : Edgar Albert Guest <br><br>

When you're up against a <mark4>trouble,</mark4><br>
Meet it squarely, face to <mark3>face;</mark3><br>
Lift your chin and set your shoulders, <br>
Plant your feet and take a <mark3>brace.</mark3><br>
When it's vain to try to dodge <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
Do the best that you can <mark3>do;</mark3><br>
You may fail, but you may conquer, <br>
See it <mark3>through!</mark3><br>
<br>
Black may be the clouds about <mark3>you</mark3><br>
And your future may seem <mark3>grim,</mark3><br>
But don't let your nerve desert <mark1>you;</mark1><br>
Keep yourself in fighting <mark3>trim.</mark3><br>
If the worst is bound to happen, <br>
Spite of all that you can <mark1>do,</mark1><br>
Running from it will not save <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
See it <mark1>through!</mark1><br>
<br>
Even hope may seem but <mark4>futile,</mark4><br>
When with troubles you're <mark4>beset,</mark4><br>
But remember you are <mark5>facing</mark5><br>
Just what other men have <mark3>met.</mark3><br>
You may fail, but fall still <mark4>fighting;</mark4><br>
Don't give up, whate'er you <mark1>do;</mark1><br>
Eyes front, head high to the finish. <br>
See it <mark1>through!</mark1><br>
