Title : Archy's Song from Charles I (A Widow Bird Sate Mourning) <br>
Author : Percy Bysshe Shelley <br><br>

Heigho! the lark and the <mark4>owl!</mark4><br>
One flies the morning, and one lulls the <mark3>night:</mark3><br>
Only the <mark4>nightingale</mark4>, poor fond <mark4>soul,</mark4><br>
Sings like the fool through darkness and <mark3>light.</mark3><br>
<br>
"A widow bird sate mourning for her <mark3>love</mark3><br>
                        Upon a wintry bough;<br>
The frozen wind crept on <mark3>above,</mark3><br>
                        The freezing stream below.<br>
<br>
"There was no leaf upon the forest <mark3>bare,</mark3><br>
No flower upon the <mark3>ground,</mark3><br>
And little motion in the <mark3>air</mark3><br>
Except the mill-wheel's <mark3>sound."</mark3><br>
