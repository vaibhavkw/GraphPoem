Title : Mr. Nobody <br>
Author : Anonymous <br><br>

I know a funny little <mark4>man,</mark4><br>
As quiet as a <mark3>mouse,</mark3><br>
Who does the mischief that is <mark4>done</mark4><br>
In everybody's <mark3>house!</mark3><br>
There's no one ever sees his <mark4>face,</mark4><br>
And yet we all <mark3>agree</mark3><br>
That every plate we break was <mark4>cracked</mark4><br>
By Mr. <mark1>Nobody.</mark1><br>
<br>
'Tis he who always tears out <mark4>books,</mark4><br>
Who leaves the door <mark3>ajar,</mark3><br>
He pulls the buttons from our <mark4>shirts,</mark4><br>
And scatters pins <mark3>afar;</mark3><br>
That squeaking door will always squeak, <br>
For prithee, don't you <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
We leave the oiling to be <mark1>done</mark1><br>
By Mr. <mark1>Nobody.</mark1><br>
<br>
He puts damp wood upon the <mark4>fire</mark4><br>
That kettles cannot <mark3>boil;</mark3><br>
His are the feet that bring in <mark4>mud,</mark4><br>
And all the carpets <mark3>soil.</mark3><br>
The papers always are <mark4>mislaid;</mark4><br>
Who had them last, but <mark3>he?</mark3><br>
There's no one tosses them <mark4>about</mark4><br>
But Mr. <mark1>Nobody.</mark1><br>
<br>
The finger marks upon the <mark4>door</mark4><br>
By none of us are <mark3>made;</mark3><br>
We never leave the blinds unclosed, <br>
To let the curtains <mark3>fade.</mark3><br>
The ink we never spill;   the <mark4>boots</mark4><br>
That lying round you <mark1>see</mark1><br>
Are not our boots,--they all belong <br>
To Mr. <mark1>Nobody.</mark1><br>
