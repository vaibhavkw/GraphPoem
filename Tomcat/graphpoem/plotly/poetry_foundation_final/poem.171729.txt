Title : September, 1918 <br>
Author : Amy Lowell <br><br>

This afternoon was the colour of water falling through <mark4>sunlight;</mark4><br>
The trees glittered with the tumbling of <mark1>leaves;</mark1><br>
The sidewalks shone like alleys of dropped maple <mark1>leaves,</mark1><br>
And the houses ran along them laughing out of square, open <mark4>windows.</mark4><br>
Under a tree in the park, <br>
Two little <mark4>boys</mark4>, lying flat on their <mark4>faces,</mark4><br>
Were carefully gathering red <mark4>berries</mark4><br>
To put in a pasteboard <mark3>box.</mark3><br>
Some day there will be no war, <br>
Then I shall take out this afternoon <br>
And turn it in my <mark4>fingers,</mark4><br>
And remark the sweet taste of it upon my <mark4>palate,</mark4><br>
And note the crisp variety of its flights of <mark1>leaves.</mark1><br>
To-day I can only gather <mark3>it</mark3><br>
And put it into my <mark3>lunch-box,</mark3><br>
For I have time for nothing <br>
But the endeavour to balance myself <br>
Upon a broken world.<br>
