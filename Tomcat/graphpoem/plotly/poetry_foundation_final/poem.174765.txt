Title : Complete Destruction <br>
Author : William Carlos Williams <br><br>

It was an icy day. <br>
We buried the <mark4>cat,</mark4><br>
then took her box <br>
and set fire to <mark4>it</mark4><br>
in the back <mark4>yard.</mark4><br>
Those fleas that <mark4>escaped</mark4><br>
earth and fire <br>
died by the <mark4>cold.</mark4><br>
