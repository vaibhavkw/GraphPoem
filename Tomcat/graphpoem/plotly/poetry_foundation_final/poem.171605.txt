Title : The Weakness <br>
Author : Toi Derricotte <br><br>

That time my grandmother dragged <mark3>me</mark3><br>
through the perfume aisles at Saks, she held me <mark1>up</mark1><br>
by my arm, hissing, "Stand <mark1>up,"</mark1><br>
through clenched teeth, her <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
bright as a <mark4>dog's</mark4><br>
cornered in the <mark4>light.</mark4><br>
She said it over and <mark4>over,</mark4><br>
as if she were <mark4>Jesus,</mark4><br>
and I were dead. She had <mark4>been</mark4><br>
solid as a <mark3>tree,</mark3><br>
a fur around her neck, <mark3>a</mark3><br>
light-skinned matron whose car was parked, who walked on <mark4>swirling</mark4><br>
marble and passed <mark1>through</mark1><br>
brass openings--in 1945. <br>
There was not even a black <br>
elevator operator at <mark4>Saks.</mark4><br>
The saleswoman had brought <mark4>velvet</mark4><br>
leggings to lace me in, and cooed, <br>
as if in the service of all <mark4>grandmothers.</mark4><br>
My grandmother had smiled, but <mark4>not</mark4><br>
hungrily, not like my <mark4>mother</mark4><br>
who hated them, but wanted to <mark4>please,</mark4><br>
and they had smiled back, as if <br>
they were wearing wooden <mark4>collars.</mark4><br>
When my legs gave out, my <mark4>grandmother</mark4><br>
dragged me up and held me like God   <br>
holds saints by <mark3>the</mark3><br>
roots of the hair. I begged her <br>
to believe I couldn't help it. <mark4>Stumbling,</mark4><br>
her face <mark4>white</mark4><br>
with sweat, she pushed me through the crowd, <mark4>rushing</mark4><br>
away from those <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
that saw <mark1>through</mark1><br>
her clothes, <mark4>under</mark4><br>
her <mark4>skin</mark4>, all the way <mark4>down</mark4><br>
to the <mark4>transparent</mark4><br>
genes <mark4>confessing.</mark4><br>
