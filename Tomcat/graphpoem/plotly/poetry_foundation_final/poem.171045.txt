Title : Togetherness <br>
Author : Yusef Komunyakaa <br><br>

Someone says <mark4>Tristan</mark4><br>
& Isolde, the shared <mark4>cup</mark4><br>
& broken vows binding <mark4>them,</mark4><br>
& someone else says Romeo   <br>
& Juliet, a lyre & Jew's <mark4>harp</mark4><br>
sighing a forbidden oath,   <br>
but I say a midnight <mark4>horn</mark4><br>
& a voice with a moody <mark4>angel</mark4><br>
inside, the two married rib   <br>
to rib, note for note. Of <mark4>course,</mark4><br>
I am thinking of those <mark4>Tuesdays</mark4><br>
or Thursdays at Billy <mark4>Berg's</mark4><br>
in LA when Lana Turner would <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
"Please sing 'Strange <mark4>Fruit'</mark4><br>
for me," & then her <mark4>dancing</mark4><br>
nightlong with Mel <mark3>Torme,</mark3><br>
as if she knew what it took   <br>
to make brass & flesh say <mark4>yes</mark4><br>
beneath the clandestine <mark4>stars</mark4><br>
& a spinning that is so <mark4>fast</mark4><br>
we can't feel the planet <mark4>moving.</mark4><br>
Is this why some of us <mark4>fall</mark4><br>
in & out of love? Did Lady <mark3>Day</mark3><br>
& Prez ever hold each other   <br>
& plead to those notorious <mark4>gods?</mark4><br>
I don't <mark1>know</mark1>, But I do <mark1>know</mark1><br>
even if a horn & voice <mark4>plumb</mark4><br>
the unknown, what remains unsaid   <br>
coalesces around an old <mark4>blues</mark4><br>
& begs with a hawk's yellow <mark4>eyes.</mark4><br>
