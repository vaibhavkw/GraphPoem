Title : Woman to Man <br>
Author : Ai <br><br>

Lightning hits the roof,   <br>
shoves the knife, <mark4>darkness,</mark4><br>
deep in the walls. <br>
They bleed light all over <mark4>us</mark4><br>
and your face, the fan, folds <mark1>up,</mark1><br>
so I won't see how <mark4>afraid</mark4><br>
to be with me you are. <br>
We don't mix, even in <mark4>bed,</mark4><br>
where we keep ending <mark1>up.</mark1><br>
There's no need to hide <mark1>it:</mark1><br>
you're snow, I'm coal, <br>
I've got the scars to prove <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
But open your mouth, <br>
I'll give you a taste of <mark3>black</mark3><br>
you won't <mark4>forget.</mark4><br>
For a while, I'll let it make you strong, <br>
make your heart lion, <br>
then I'll take it <mark3>back.</mark3><br>
