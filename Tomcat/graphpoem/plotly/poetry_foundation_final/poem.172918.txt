Title : Holy Thursday: Is this a holy thing to see <br>
Author : William Blake <br><br>

Is this a holy thing to see, <br>
In a rich and fruitful <mark3>land,</mark3><br>
Babes reducd to <mark4>misery,</mark4><br>
Fed with cold and usurous <mark3>hand?</mark3><br>
<br>
Is that trembling cry a song? <br>
Can it be a song of joy? <br>
And so many children <mark4>poor?</mark4><br>
It is a land of <mark4>poverty!</mark4><br>
<br>
And their sun does never <mark1>shine.</mark1><br>
And their fields are bleak & <mark4>bare.</mark4><br>
And their ways are fill'd with thorns. <br>
It is eternal winter <mark3>there.</mark3><br>
<br>
For where-e'er the sun does <mark1>shine,</mark1><br>
And where-e'er the rain does <mark3>fall:</mark3><br>
Babe can never hunger <mark1>there,</mark1><br>
Nor poverty the mind <mark3>appall.</mark3><br>
