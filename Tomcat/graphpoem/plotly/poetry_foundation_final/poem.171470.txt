Title : Song of Napalm <br>
Author : Bruce Weigl <br><br>

for my wife<br>
After the storm, after the rain stopped <mark1>pounding,</mark1><br>
We stood in the doorway watching <mark1>horses</mark1><br>
Walk off lazily across the pasture's <mark4>hill.</mark4><br>
We stared through the black <mark4>screen,</mark4><br>
Our vision altered by the <mark4>distance</mark4><br>
So I thought I saw a <mark4>mist</mark4><br>
Kicked up around their hooves when they <mark4>faded</mark4><br>
Like cut-out <mark1>horses</mark1><br>
Away from <mark4>us.</mark4><br>
The grass was never more blue in that light, <mark4>more</mark4><br>
Scarlet; beyond the <mark4>pasture</mark4><br>
Trees scraped their voices into the wind, <mark4>branches</mark4><br>
Crisscrossed the sky like barbed <mark4>wire</mark4><br>
But you said they were only <mark1>branches.</mark1><br>
<br>
Okay. The storm stopped <mark1>pounding.</mark1><br>
I am trying to say this straight: for <mark4>once</mark4><br>
I was sane enough to pause and breathe   <br>
Outside my wild plans and after the hard <mark4>rain</mark4><br>
I turned my back on the old curses. I <mark4>believed</mark4><br>
They swung finally away from me ... <br>
<br>
But still the branches are <mark1>wire</mark1><br>
And thunder is the pounding <mark4>mortar,</mark4><br>
Still I close my eyes and see the <mark4>girl</mark4><br>
Running from her village, napalm   <br>
Stuck to her dress like jelly, <br>
Her hands reaching for the no <mark4>one</mark4><br>
Who waits in waves of heat before her. <br>
<br>
So I can keep on <mark4>living,</mark4><br>
So I can stay here beside you, <br>
I try to imagine she runs down the road and <mark4>wings</mark4><br>
Beat inside her until she <mark4>rises</mark4><br>
Above the stinking jungle and her <mark4>pain</mark4><br>
Eases, and your <mark4>pain</mark4>, and <mark4>mine.</mark4><br>
<br>
But the lie swings back <mark4>again.</mark4><br>
The lie works only as long as it takes to speak   <br>
And the girl runs only as <mark4>far</mark4><br>
As the napalm <mark4>allows</mark4><br>
Until her burning tendons and <mark4>crackling</mark4><br>
Muscles draw her up <br>
into that final <mark4>position</mark4><br>
<br>
Burning bodies so perfectly assume. <mark4>Nothing</mark4><br>
Can change that; she is burned behind my <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
And not your good love and not the rain-swept <mark4>air</mark4><br>
And not the jungle <mark4>green</mark4><br>
Pasture unfolding before us can deny <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
