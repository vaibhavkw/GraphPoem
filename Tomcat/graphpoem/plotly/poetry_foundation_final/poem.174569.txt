Title : Sapphics <br>
Author : Algernon Charles Swinburne <br><br>

All the night sleep came not upon my <mark4>eyelids,</mark4><br>
Shed not dew, nor shook nor unclosed a <mark4>feather,</mark4><br>
Yet with lips shut close and with eyes of <mark4>iron</mark4><br>
Stood and beheld <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then to me so lying awake a <mark4>vision</mark4><br>
Came without sleep over the seas and touched <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Softly touched mine eyelids and lips; and I <mark1>too,</mark1><br>
Full of the <mark1>vision,</mark1><br>
<br>
Saw the white implacable <mark1>Aphrodite,</mark1><br>
Saw the hair unbound and the feet unsandalled <br>
Shine as fire of sunset on western <mark4>waters;</mark4><br>
Saw the <mark4>reluctant</mark4><br>
<br>
Feet, the straining plumes of the doves that drew <mark1>her,</mark1><br>
Looking always, looking with necks <mark4>reverted,</mark4><br>
Back to Lesbos, back to the hills whereunder <br>
   Shone Mitylene; <br>
<br>
Heard the flying feet of the Loves behind <mark1>her</mark1><br>
Make a sudden thunder upon the <mark1>waters,</mark1><br>
As the thunder flung from the strong unclosing <br>
Wings of a great <mark4>wind.</mark4><br>
<br>
So the goddess fled from her place, with <mark4>awful</mark4><br>
Sound of feet and thunder of wings around <mark1>her;</mark1><br>
While behind a clamour of singing <mark4>women</mark4><br>
Severed the <mark4>twilight.</mark4><br>
<br>
Ah the singing, ah the delight, the <mark4>passion!</mark4><br>
All the Loves wept, listening; sick with anguish, <br>
Stood the crowned nine Muses about Apollo; <br>
Fear was upon <mark1>them,</mark1><br>
<br>
While the tenth sang wonderful things they knew <mark4>not.</mark4><br>
Ah the tenth, the Lesbian! the nine were <mark4>silent,</mark4><br>
None endured the sound of her song for <mark4>weeping;</mark4><br>
Laurel by <mark4>laurel,</mark4><br>
<br>
Faded all their crowns; but about her <mark4>forehead,</mark4><br>
Round her woven tresses and ashen <mark4>temples</mark4><br>
White as dead snow, paler than grass in <mark4>summer,</mark4><br>
Ravaged with <mark4>kisses,</mark4><br>
<br>
Shone a light of fire as a crown for <mark4>ever.</mark4><br>
Yea, almost the implacable <mark1>Aphrodite</mark1><br>
Paused, and almost wept; such a song was that <mark4>song.</mark4><br>
Yea, by her name <mark1>too</mark1><br>
<br>
Called her, saying, "Turn to me, O my Sappho;" <br>
Yet she turned her face from the Loves, she saw <mark1>not</mark1><br>
Tears for laughter darken immortal <mark1>eyelids,</mark1><br>
Heard not about <mark1>her</mark1><br>
<br>
Fearful fitful wings of the doves <mark4>departing,</mark4><br>
Saw not how the bosom of <mark1>Aphrodite</mark1><br>
Shook with weeping, saw not her shaken raiment, <br>
Saw not her hands <mark4>wrung;</mark4><br>
<br>
Saw the Lesbians kissing across their <mark4>smitten</mark4><br>
Lutes with lips more sweet than the sound of <mark4>lute-strings,</mark4><br>
Mouth to mouth and hand upon hand, her <mark4>chosen,</mark4><br>
Fairer than all <mark4>men;</mark4><br>
<br>
Only saw the beautiful lips and <mark4>fingers,</mark4><br>
Full of songs and kisses and little <mark4>whispers,</mark4><br>
Full of music; only beheld among <mark1>them</mark1><br>
Soar, as a bird <mark4>soars</mark4><br>
<br>
Newly fledged, her visible song, a <mark4>marvel,</mark4><br>
Made of perfect sound and exceeding <mark1>passion,</mark1><br>
Sweetly shapen, terrible, full of <mark4>thunders,</mark4><br>
Clothed with the wind's <mark4>wings.</mark4><br>
<br>
Then rejoiced she, laughing with love, and <mark4>scattered</mark4><br>
Roses, awful roses of holy <mark4>blossom;</mark4><br>
Then the Loves thronged sadly with hidden <mark4>faces</mark4><br>
Round <mark1>Aphrodite,</mark1><br>
<br>
Then the Muses, stricken at <mark4>heart</mark4>, were <mark1>silent;</mark1><br>
Yea, the gods waxed pale; such a song was that <mark1>song.</mark1><br>
All reluctant, all with a fresh repulsion, <br>
Fled from before <mark1>her.</mark1><br>
<br>
All withdrew long since, and the land was <mark4>barren,</mark4><br>
Full of fruitless women and music <mark4>only.</mark4><br>
Now perchance, when winds are assuaged at <mark4>sunset,</mark4><br>
   Lulled at the dewfall, <br>
<br>
By the grey sea-side, unassuaged, unheard of, <br>
Unbeloved, unseen in the ebb of <mark1>twilight,</mark1><br>
Ghosts of outcast women return <mark4>lamenting,</mark4><br>
   Purged not in Lethe, <br>
<br>
Clothed about with flame and with tears, and <mark4>singing</mark4><br>
Songs that move the heart of the shaken <mark4>heaven,</mark4><br>
Songs that break the heart of the earth with <mark4>pity,</mark4><br>
Hearing, to hear <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
