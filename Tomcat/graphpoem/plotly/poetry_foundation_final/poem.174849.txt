Title : In Spain <br>
Author : Sir Thomas Wyatt <br><br>

<br>
Tagus, farewell! that westward with thy <mark4>streams</mark4><br>
Turns up the grains of gold already <mark3>tried</mark3><br>
With spur and sail, for I go seek the <mark4>Thames</mark4><br>
Gainward the sun that shewth her wealthy <mark3>pride,</mark3><br>
And to the town which Brutus sought by <mark4>dreams,</mark4><br>
Like bended moon doth lend her lusty <mark3>side.</mark3><br>
My king, my country, alone for whome I <mark3>live,</mark3><br>
Of mighty love the wings for this me <mark3>give.</mark3><br>
