Title : To Fishermen <br>
Author : Carol Frost <br><br>

No more savage art: filleting: a deft pressure along <mark3>the</mark3><br>
<br>
from tail fan to the red gills: fighting mystery with <mark3>a</mark3><br>
honed <mark4>blade</mark4><br>
through the small bones: salt and scales on face <mark4>and</mark4><br>
<br>
hands:: the Greek <mark4>God,</mark4><br>
as well, found flesh unmysterious, but in anger <mark1>and</mark1><br>
<br>
seagull cries, your music, are all about you: Apollonian <br>
<br>
but hungrier: nature is <mark4>hungry::</mark4><br>
the brave fish dies the birds swoop for the insides in no<br>
      lovelier spirals.<br>
