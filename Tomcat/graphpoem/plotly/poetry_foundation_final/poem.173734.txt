Title : from Endymion <br>
Author : John Keats <br><br>

A Poetic Romance  (excerpt)<br>
BOOK <mark3>I</mark3><br>
A thing of beauty is a joy for <mark3>ever:</mark3><br>
Its loveliness increases; it will <mark3>never</mark3><br>
Pass into nothingness; but still will <mark3>keep</mark3><br>
A bower quiet for us, and a <mark3>sleep</mark3><br>
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing. <br>
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing <br>
A flowery band to bind us to the <mark3>earth,</mark3><br>
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman <mark3>dearth</mark3><br>
Of noble <mark4>natures</mark4>, of the gloomy <mark4>days,</mark4><br>
Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened <mark3>ways</mark3><br>
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of <mark3>all,</mark3><br>
Some shape of beauty moves away the <mark3>pall</mark3><br>
From our dark spirits. Such the <mark4>sun</mark4>, the <mark4>moon,</mark4><br>
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady <mark3>boon</mark3><br>
For simple sheep; and such are <mark4>daffodils</mark4><br>
With the green world they live in; and clear rills <br>
That for themselves a cooling covert <mark3>make</mark3><br>
'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest <mark3>brake,</mark3><br>
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose <mark4>blooms:</mark4><br>
And such too is the grandeur of the <mark3>dooms</mark3><br>
We have imagined for the mighty <mark5>dead;</mark5><br>
All lovely tales that we have heard or <mark3>read:</mark3><br>
An endless fountain of immortal <mark4>drink,</mark4><br>
Pouring unto us from the heaven's <mark3>brink.</mark3><br>
<br>
       Nor do we merely feel these essences <br>
For one short hour; no, even as the <mark4>trees</mark4><br>
That whisper round a temple become <mark3>soon</mark3><br>
Dear as the temple's self, so does the <mark1>moon,</mark1><br>
The passion poesy, glories <mark4>infinite,</mark4><br>
Haunt us till they become a cheering <mark4>light</mark4><br>
Unto our souls, and bound to us so <mark4>fast,</mark4><br>
That, whether there be shine, or gloom <mark4>o'ercast;</mark4><br>
They always must be with us, or we <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
<br>
Therefore, 'tis with full happiness that <mark1>I</mark1><br>
Will trace the story of Endymion. <br>
The very music of the name has <mark4>gone</mark4><br>
Into my being, and each pleasant <mark4>scene</mark4><br>
Is growing fresh before me as the <mark3>green</mark3><br>
Of our own valleys: so I will <mark4>begin</mark4><br>
Now while I cannot hear the city's <mark3>din;</mark3><br>
Now while the early budders are just <mark3>new,</mark3><br>
And run in mazes of the youngest <mark3>hue</mark3><br>
About old forests; while the willow <mark4>trails</mark4><br>
Its delicate amber; and the dairy <mark3>pails</mark3><br>
Bring home increase of milk. And, as the <mark3>year</mark3><br>
Grows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly <mark3>steer</mark3><br>
My little boat, for many quiet <mark4>hours,</mark4><br>
With streams that deepen freshly into <mark3>bowers.</mark3><br>
Many and many a verse I hope to <mark4>write,</mark4><br>
Before the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and <mark3>white,</mark3><br>
Hide in deep herbage; and ere yet the <mark4>bees</mark4><br>
Hum about globes of clover and sweet <mark3>peas,</mark3><br>
I must be near the middle of my <mark3>story.</mark3><br>
O may no wintry season, bare and <mark3>hoary,</mark3><br>
See it half finish'd: but let Autumn <mark4>bold,</mark4><br>
With universal tinge of sober <mark3>gold,</mark3><br>
Be all about me when I make an <mark4>end.</mark4><br>
And now, at once adventuresome, I <mark3>send</mark3><br>
My herald thought into a <mark4>wilderness:</mark4><br>
There let its trumpet blow, and quickly <mark4>dress</mark4><br>
My uncertain path with green, that I may <mark4>speed</mark4><br>
Easily <mark4>onward</mark4>, thorough flowers and <mark3>weed.</mark3><br>
