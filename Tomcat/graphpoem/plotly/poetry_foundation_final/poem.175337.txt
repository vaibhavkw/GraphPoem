Title : One Girl of Many <br>
Author : Charlotte Anna Perkins Gilman <br><br>

<br>
One girl of many. Hungry from her <mark3>birth</mark3><br>
Half-fed. Half-clothed. Untaught of woman's <mark3>worth.</mark3><br>
In joyless girlhood working for her <mark3>bread.</mark3><br>
At each small sorrow wishing she were <mark3>dead,</mark3><br>
Yet gay at little <mark4>pleasures</mark4>, Sunlight <mark4>seems</mark4><br>
Most bright & warm where it most seldom <mark3>gleams.</mark3><br>
<br>
One girl of many. Tawdry dress and <mark4>old;</mark4><br>
And not enough beneath to bar the <mark3>cold.</mark3><br>
The little that she had misspent <mark4>because</mark4><br>
She had no knowledge of our nature's <mark3>laws.</mark3><br>
Thinking in ignorance that it was <mark3>best</mark3><br>
To wear a stylish look, and -- bear the <mark3>rest.</mark3><br>
One girl of many. With a human <mark4>heart.</mark4><br>
<br>
A woman's too; with nerves that feel the <mark3>smart</mark3><br>
Of each new pain as keenly as your <mark3>own.</mark3><br>
The old ones, through long use, have softer <mark3>grown.</mark3><br>
And yet in spite of use she holds the <mark4>thought</mark4><br>
Of might-be joys more than, perhaps, she <mark3>ought.</mark3><br>
One girl of many. But the fault is <mark4>here;</mark4><br>
Though she to all the others was so <mark4>near;</mark4><br>
<br>
One difference there was, which made a <mark3>change.</mark3><br>
No wrong thing, surely. Consequence most <mark3>strange!</mark3><br>
Alike in birth. Alike in life's rough <mark3>way.</mark3><br>
She, through no evil, was more fair than <mark3>they.</mark3><br>
So came the offer, "Leave this story <mark1>cold</mark1><br>
Where you may drudge and starve till you are <mark1>old.</mark1><br>
Come! I will give you rest. And food. And <mark4>fire.</mark4><br>
<br>
And fair apparel to your heart's <mark3>desire;</mark3><br>
Shelter. Protection. Kindness. Peace & <mark3>Love.</mark3><br>
Has your life anything you hold <mark3>above?"</mark3><br>
And she had <mark4>not</mark4>, In all her daily <mark4>sight</mark4><br>
There shone no vestige of the color <mark3>White.</mark3><br>
She had seen nothing in her narrow <mark3>life</mark3><br>
To make her venerate the title <mark3>"Wife."</mark3><br>
<br>
She knew no reason why the thing was <mark3>wrong;</mark3><br>
And instinct grows debased in ages <mark3>long.</mark3><br>
All things that she had ever yet <mark4>desired</mark4><br>
All dreams that her starved girlhood's heart had <mark3>fired</mark3><br>
All that life held of yet unknown <mark3>delight</mark3><br>
Shone, to her ignorance, in colors <mark3>bright.</mark3><br>
Shone near at hand and sure. If she had <mark3>known!</mark3><br>
<br>
But she was ignorant. She was <mark3>alone.</mark3><br>
And so she - sinned. I think we call it <mark4>sin.</mark4><br>
And found that every step she took <mark3>therein</mark3><br>
Made sinning easier and conscience <mark3>weak.</mark3><br>
And there was never one who cared to <mark3>speak</mark3><br>
A word to guide and warn <mark3>her</mark3>, If there <mark3>were</mark3><br>
I fear such help were thrown away on <mark3>her.</mark3><br>
<br>
Only one girl of many. Of the <mark4>street.</mark4><br>
In lowest depths. The story grows unmeet<br>
For wellbred ears. Sorrow and sin and <mark3>shame</mark3><br>
Over and over till the blackened <mark3>name</mark3><br>
Sank out of sight without a hand to <mark4>save.</mark4><br>
Sin, shame, and sorrow. Sickness, & the <mark3>grave.</mark3><br>
Only one girl of many. Tis a <mark4>need</mark4><br>
<br>
Of man's existence to repeat the <mark3>deed.</mark3><br>
Social necessity. Men cannot <mark4>live</mark4><br>
Without what these disgraceful creatures <mark3>give.</mark3><br>
Black shame. Dishonor. Misery & <mark1>Sin.</mark1><br>
And men find needed health & life <mark1>therein.</mark1><br>
