Title : We Wear the Mask <br>
Author : Paul Laurence Dunbar <br><br>

We wear the mask that grins and <mark3>lies,</mark3><br>
It hides our cheeks and shades our <mark3>eyes,--</mark3><br>
This debt we pay to human <mark3>guile;</mark3><br>
With torn and bleeding hearts we <mark3>smile,</mark3><br>
And mouth with myriad <mark4>subtleties.</mark4><br>
<br>
Why should the world be <mark4>over-wise,</mark4><br>
In counting all our tears and <mark3>sighs?</mark3><br>
Nay, let them only see us, <mark3>while</mark3><br>
We wear the <mark1>mask.</mark1><br>
<br>
We smile, but, O great Christ, our <mark3>cries</mark3><br>
To thee from tortured souls <mark3>arise.</mark3><br>
We sing, but oh the clay is <mark3>vile</mark3><br>
Beneath our feet, and long the <mark3>mile;</mark3><br>
But let the world dream <mark4>otherwise,</mark4><br>
We wear the <mark1>mask!</mark1><br>
