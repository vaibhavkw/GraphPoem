Title : At Darien Bridge <br>
Author : James L. Dickey <br><br>

The sea here used to <mark1>look</mark1><br>
As if many convicts had built <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
<br>
Standing deep in their ankle <mark4>chains,</mark4><br>
Ankle-deep in the water, to smite <br>
<br>
The land and break it down to <mark4>salt.</mark4><br>
I was in this bog as a <mark4>child</mark4><br>
<br>
When they were all working all day   <br>
To drive the pilings <mark4>down.</mark4><br>
<br>
I thought I saw the still <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
Strike the side of a hammer in <mark4>flight</mark4><br>
<br>
And from it a sea bird be <mark4>born</mark4><br>
To take off over the <mark4>marshes.</mark4><br>
<br>
As the gray climbs the side of my <mark4>head</mark4><br>
And cuts my brain off from the <mark4>world,</mark4><br>
<br>
I walk and wish mainly for <mark4>birds,</mark4><br>
For the one bird no one has looked <mark4>for</mark4><br>
<br>
To spring again from a flash <br>
Of metal, perhaps from the <mark4>scratched</mark4><br>
<br>
Wedding band on my ring <mark4>finger.</mark4><br>
Recalling the chains of their <mark4>feet,</mark4><br>
<br>
I stand and look out over <mark4>grasses</mark4><br>
At the bridge they built, long <mark4>abandoned,</mark4><br>
<br>
Breaking down into water at <mark4>last,</mark4><br>
And long, like <mark4>them</mark4>, for <mark4>freedom</mark4><br>
<br>
Or death, or to believe <mark4>again</mark4><br>
That they worked on the ocean to give <mark1>it</mark1><br>
<br>
The unchanging, hopeless <mark1>look</mark1><br>
Out of which all miracles leap.<br>
