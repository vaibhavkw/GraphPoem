Title : Reichsmarschall Hermann Goring (1 April 1945) <br>
Author : W. D. Snodgrass <br><br>

(Goring, head of the Luftwaffe, once bragged that if one German city were bombed, they could call him "Meier." At his Karinhall estate, he questions himself and his <mark4>disgrace.)</mark4><br>
And why, Herr Reichsmarschall, is <mark4>Italy</mark4><br>
Just like schnitzel? If they're <mark3>beaten</mark3><br>
Either one will just get <mark4>bigger.</mark4><br>
Neither cuts too firm a <mark4>figure.</mark4><br>
Still, all this humble pie you've <mark3>eaten</mark3><br>
Lately, fills you out quite prettily. <br>
<br>
Why then, Herr Goring, how can <mark3>we</mark3><br>
Tell you and Italy <mark3>apart?</mark3><br>
Italy always wins through <mark3>losing;</mark3><br>
I, just the opposite, by <mark3>using</mark3><br>
High skills and cunning learned the <mark3>art</mark3><br>
Of flat pratfalls through <mark4>victory.</mark4><br>
<br>
You've led our Flying Circus; <mark3>how</mark3><br>
Could our war ace turn to a <mark4>clown?</mark4><br>
Both pad out over-extended <mark4>fronts;</mark4><br>
Both keep alive doing slick <mark3>stunts</mark3><br>
And, even so, both get shot <mark3>down.</mark3><br>
But only one's called "Meier" <mark3>now.</mark3><br>
<br>
Pray, could an old, soft football <mark4>be</mark4><br>
Much like a man in deep <mark1>disgrace?</mark1><br>
They don't kick back; don't even <mark3>dare</mark3><br>
Look up--the British own the <mark3>air!</mark3><br>
Then, stick a needle in <mark4>someplace;</mark4><br>
Pump yourself full of <mark4>vacancy.</mark4><br>
<br>
Tell us, dear Minister for <mark1>Air,</mark1><br>
Are warriors, then, like a bad <mark3>smell?</mark3><br>
Neither stays inside its <mark4>borders;</mark4><br>
Either's bound to follow ordures; <br>
They both expand and play the <mark3>swell</mark3><br>
Though something's getting spoiled <mark4>somewhere.</mark4><br>
<br>
Then answer one more question, which <mark4>is</mark4><br>
Are politicians like whipped <mark3>cream?</mark3><br>
They both inflate themselves with <mark4>gas;</mark4><br>
Also they both puff up your <mark3>ass</mark3><br>
Till you're exposed like some bad <mark3>dream</mark3><br>
Where you've grown too big for your <mark4>britches.</mark4><br>
<br>
Herr <mark4>President</mark4>, can't we tell <mark1>apart</mark1><br>
An artful statesman and an <mark1>ass?</mark1><br>
Fat chance! One spouts out high <mark4>ideals;</mark4><br>
One makes low rumblings after <mark3>meals.</mark3><br>
But that's the threat of leaking <mark1>gas</mark1><br>
Which all men fear! No; that's a <mark3>fart.</mark3><br>
<br>
Last, could you give one simple <mark4>rule</mark4><br>
To tell a medal from a turd? <br>
No. They both come from those above <mark1>you</mark1><br>
Conveying their opinion of <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
Right! Here's your new medal, conferred   <br>
For vast achievements: April <mark3>Fool!</mark3><br>
