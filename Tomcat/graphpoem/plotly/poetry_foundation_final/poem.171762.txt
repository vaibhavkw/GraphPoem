Title : Ox Cart Man <br>
Author : Donald Hall <br><br>

In October of the <mark4>year,</mark4><br>
he counts potatoes dug from the brown <mark4>field,</mark4><br>
counting the seed, counting   <br>
the cellar's portion <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
and bags the rest on the cart's <mark4>floor.</mark4><br>
<br>
He packs wool sheared in April, <mark4>honey</mark4><br>
in combs, linen, <mark4>leather</mark4><br>
tanned from deerhide,   <br>
and vinegar in a <mark5>barrel</mark5><br>
hooped by hand at the forge's <mark4>fire.</mark4><br>
<br>
He walks by his ox's head, ten <mark4>days</mark4><br>
to Portsmouth Market, and sells <mark4>potatoes,</mark4><br>
and the bag that carried <mark1>potatoes,</mark1><br>
flaxseed, birch brooms, maple sugar, <mark4>goose</mark4><br>
feathers, <mark3>yarn.</mark3><br>
<br>
When the cart is empty he sells the <mark4>cart.</mark4><br>
When the cart is sold he sells the <mark4>ox,</mark4><br>
harness and yoke, and <mark4>walks</mark4><br>
home, his pockets <mark4>heavy</mark4><br>
with the year's coin for salt and <mark4>taxes,</mark4><br>
<br>
and at home by fire's light in November <mark4>cold</mark4><br>
stitches new <mark4>harness</mark4><br>
for next year's ox in the <mark3>barn,</mark3><br>
and carves the yoke, and saws <mark4>planks</mark4><br>
building the cart <mark4>again.</mark4><br>
