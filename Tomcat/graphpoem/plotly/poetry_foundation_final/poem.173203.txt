Title : The Dying Child <br>
Author : John Clare <br><br>

He could not die when trees were <mark3>green,</mark3><br>
For he loved the time too <mark4>well.</mark4><br>
His little hands, when flowers were <mark3>seen,</mark3><br>
Were held for the <mark4>bluebell,</mark4><br>
As he was carried o'er the <mark1>green.</mark1><br>
<br>
His eye glanced at the white-nosed <mark3>bee;</mark3><br>
He knew those children of the <mark3>spring:</mark3><br>
When he was well and on the <mark3>lea</mark3><br>
He held one in his hands to <mark3>sing,</mark3><br>
Which filled his heart with <mark3>glee.</mark3><br>
<br>
Infants, the children of the <mark1>spring!</mark1><br>
How can an infant <mark3>die</mark3><br>
When butterflies are on the <mark3>wing,</mark3><br>
Green grass, and such a <mark3>sky?</mark3><br>
How can they die at <mark1>spring?</mark1><br>
<br>
He held his hands for daisies <mark3>white,</mark3><br>
And then for violets <mark5>blue,</mark5><br>
And took them all to bed at <mark3>night</mark3><br>
That in the green fields <mark3>grew,</mark3><br>
As childhood's sweet <mark3>delight.</mark3><br>
<br>
And then he shut his little <mark3>eyes,</mark3><br>
And flowers would notice <mark4>not;</mark4><br>
Birds' nests and eggs caused no <mark3>surprise,</mark3><br>
He now no blossoms <mark3>got;</mark3><br>
They met with plaintive <mark3>sighs.</mark3><br>
<br>
When winter came and blasts did <mark3>sigh,</mark3><br>
And bare were plain and <mark3>tree,</mark3><br>
As he for ease in bed did <mark3>lie</mark3><br>
His soul seemed with the <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
         He died so quietly.<br>
