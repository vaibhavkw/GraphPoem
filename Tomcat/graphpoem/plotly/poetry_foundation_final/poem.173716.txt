Title : Cynthia's Revels: Queen and huntress, chaste and fair <br>
Author : Ben Jonson <br><br>

Queen and huntress, chaste and <mark3>fair,</mark3><br>
Now the sun is laid to <mark3>sleep,</mark3><br>
Seated in thy silver <mark3>chair</mark3><br>
State in wonted manner <mark3>keep:</mark3><br>
Hesperus entreats thy <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
Goddess excellently <mark3>bright.</mark3><br>
<br>
Earth, let not thy envious <mark3>shade</mark3><br>
Dare itself to <mark3>interpose;</mark3><br>
Cynthia's shining orb was <mark3>made</mark3><br>
Heaven to clear when day did <mark3>close:</mark3><br>
Bless us then with wished <mark3>sight,</mark3><br>
Goddess excellently <mark1>bright.</mark1><br>
<br>
Lay thy bow of pearl <mark4>apart</mark4><br>
And thy crystal-shining quiver;<br>
Give unto the flying <mark3>hart</mark3><br>
Space to breathe, how short soever:<br>
Thou that mak'st a day of <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
Goddess excellently <mark1>bright.</mark1><br>
