Title : The Barefoot Boy <br>
Author : John Greenleaf Whittier <br><br>

Blessings on thee, little <mark3>man,</mark3><br>
Barefoot boy, with cheek of <mark3>tan!</mark3><br>
With thy turned-up <mark4>pantaloons,</mark4><br>
And thy merry whistled <mark4>tunes;</mark4><br>
With thy red lip, redder <mark3>still</mark3><br>
Kissed by strawberries on the <mark3>hill;</mark3><br>
With the sunshine on thy <mark3>face,</mark3><br>
Through thy torn brim's jaunty <mark3>grace;</mark3><br>
From my heart I give thee <mark3>joy,--</mark3><br>
I was once a barefoot <mark3>boy!</mark3><br>
Prince thou art,--the grown-up <mark1>man</mark1><br>
Only is <mark4>republican.</mark4><br>
Let the million-dollared <mark3>ride!</mark3><br>
Barefoot, trudging at his <mark3>side,</mark3><br>
Thou hast more than he can <mark3>buy</mark3><br>
In the reach of ear and <mark3>eye,--</mark3><br>
Outward sunshine, inward <mark1>joy:</mark1><br>
Blessings on thee, barefoot <mark1>boy!</mark1><br>
<br>
Oh for boyhood's painless <mark3>play,</mark3><br>
Sleep that wakes in laughing <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
Health that mocks the doctor's <mark4>rules,</mark4><br>
Knowledge never learned of <mark3>schools,</mark3><br>
Of the wild bee's morning <mark3>chase,</mark3><br>
Of the wild-flower's time and <mark3>place,</mark3><br>
Flight of fowl and habitude <br>
Of the tenants of the <mark4>wood;</mark4><br>
How the tortoise bears his <mark4>shell,</mark4><br>
How the woodchuck digs his <mark3>cell,</mark3><br>
And the ground-mole sinks his <mark3>well;</mark3><br>
How the robin feeds her <mark3>young,</mark3><br>
How the oriole's nest is <mark3>hung;</mark3><br>
Where the whitest lilies <mark3>blow,</mark3><br>
Where the freshest berries <mark3>grow,</mark3><br>
Where the ground-nut trails its <mark4>vine,</mark4><br>
Where the wood-grape's clusters <mark3>shine;</mark3><br>
Of the black wasp's cunning <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
Mason of his walls of <mark3>clay,</mark3><br>
And the architectural <mark4>plans</mark4><br>
Of gray hornet <mark4>artisans!</mark4><br>
For, eschewing books and <mark4>tasks,</mark4><br>
Nature answers all he <mark3>asks;</mark3><br>
Hand in hand with her he <mark4>walks,</mark4><br>
Face to face with her he <mark3>talks,</mark3><br>
Part and parcel of her <mark1>joy,--</mark1><br>
Blessings on the barefoot <mark1>boy!</mark1><br>
<br>
Oh for boyhood's time of <mark4>June,</mark4><br>
Crowding years in one brief <mark3>moon,</mark3><br>
When all things I heard or saw, <br>
Me, their <mark4>master</mark4>, waited <mark4>for.</mark4><br>
I was rich in flowers and <mark4>trees,</mark4><br>
Humming-birds and <mark4>honey-bees;</mark4><br>
For my sport the squirrel <mark4>played,</mark4><br>
Plied the snouted mole his <mark3>spade;</mark3><br>
For my taste the blackberry <mark4>cone</mark4><br>
Purpled over hedge and <mark3>stone;</mark3><br>
Laughed the brook for my <mark3>delight</mark3><br>
Through the day and through the <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
Whispering at the garden <mark4>wall,</mark4><br>
Talked with me from fall to <mark3>fall;</mark3><br>
Mine the sand-rimmed pickerel <mark4>pond,</mark4><br>
Mine the walnut slopes <mark3>beyond,</mark3><br>
Mine, on bending orchard <mark1>trees,</mark1><br>
Apples of Hesperides! <br>
Still as my horizon <mark3>grew,</mark3><br>
Larger grew my riches <mark3>too;</mark3><br>
All the world I saw or <mark3>knew</mark3><br>
Seemed a complex Chinese <mark3>toy,</mark3><br>
Fashioned for a barefoot <mark1>boy!</mark1><br>
<br>
Oh for festal dainties <mark4>spread,</mark4><br>
Like my bowl of milk and <mark3>bread;</mark3><br>
Pewter spoon and bowl of <mark1>wood,</mark1><br>
On the door-stone, gray and <mark4>rude!</mark4><br>
O'er me, like a regal <mark4>tent,</mark4><br>
Cloudy-ribbed, the sunset <mark3>bent,</mark3><br>
Purple-curtained, fringed with <mark4>gold,</mark4><br>
Looped in many a wind-swung <mark3>fold;</mark3><br>
While for music came the <mark1>play</mark1><br>
Of the pied frogs' orchestra; <br>
And, to light the noisy <mark4>choir,</mark4><br>
Lit the fly his lamp of <mark3>fire.</mark3><br>
I was monarch: pomp and <mark1>joy</mark1><br>
Waited on the barefoot <mark1>boy!</mark1><br>
<br>
Cheerily, <mark4>then</mark4>, my little <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
Live and laugh, as boyhood <mark3>can!</mark3><br>
Though the flinty slopes be <mark4>hard,</mark4><br>
Stubble-speared the new-mown <mark4>sward,</mark4><br>
Every morn shall lead thee <mark3>through</mark3><br>
Fresh baptisms of the <mark3>dew;</mark3><br>
Every evening from thy <mark4>feet</mark4><br>
Shall the cool wind kiss the <mark3>heat:</mark3><br>
All too soon these feet must <mark4>hide</mark4><br>
In the prison cells of <mark3>pride,</mark3><br>
Lose the freedom of the <mark4>sod,</mark4><br>
Like a colt's for work be <mark3>shod,</mark3><br>
Made to tread the mills of <mark4>toil,</mark4><br>
Up and down in ceaseless moil: <br>
Happy if their track be <mark4>found</mark4><br>
Never on forbidden <mark3>ground;</mark3><br>
Happy if they sink not <mark4>in</mark4><br>
Quick and treacherous sands of <mark3>sin.</mark3><br>
Ah! that thou couldst know thy <mark1>joy,</mark1><br>
Ere it passes, barefoot <mark1>boy!</mark1><br>
