Title : Mementos, 1 <br>
Author : W. D. Snodgrass <br><br>

Sorting out letters and piles of my <mark4>old</mark4><br>
Canceled checks, old <mark4>clippings</mark4>, and yellow note <mark4>cards</mark4><br>
That meant something once, I happened to <mark4>find</mark4><br>
Your picture. That picture. I stopped there <mark4>cold,</mark4><br>
Like a man raking piles of dead leaves in his <mark4>yard</mark4><br>
Who has turned up a severed <mark4>hand.</mark4><br>
<br>
Still, that first <mark4>second</mark4>, I was glad: you <mark3>stand</mark3><br>
    Just as you stood--shy, delicate, slender, <br>
In that long gown of green lace netting and <mark4>daisies</mark4><br>
That you wore to our first dance. The sight of you <mark4>stunned</mark4><br>
Us all. Well, our needs were different, <mark5>then,</mark5><br>
             And our ideals came easy. <br>
<br>
Then through the war and those two long <mark4>years</mark4><br>
Overseas, the Japanese dead in their <mark4>shacks</mark4><br>
Among dishes, dolls, and lost shoes; I <mark4>carried</mark4><br>
This glimpse of you, <mark4>there</mark4>, to choke down my <mark4>fear,</mark4><br>
Prove it had been, that it might come back. <br>
That was before we got <mark3>married.</mark3><br>
<br>
--Before we drained out one another's <mark4>force</mark4><br>
    With lies, self-denial, unspoken regret <br>
And the sick eyes that blame; before the <mark3>divorce</mark3><br>
    And the treachery. Say it: before we met. Still,   <br>
I put back your picture. Someday, in due <mark3>course,</mark3><br>
I will find that it's still <mark4>there.</mark4><br>
