Title : My mother's body <br>
Author : Marge Piercy <br><br>

<br>
The dark socket of the <mark1>year</mark1><br>
the pit, the cave where the sun lies <mark4>down</mark4><br>
and threatens never to <mark4>rise,</mark4><br>
when despair descends softly as the <mark3>snow</mark3><br>
covering all paths and choking <mark4>roads:</mark4><br>
then hawkfaced pain seized <mark3>you</mark3><br>
<br>
threw you so you fell with a <mark4>sharp</mark4><br>
cry, a knife tearing a bolt of <mark4>silk.</mark4><br>
My father heard the crash but <mark4>paid</mark4><br>
no mind, napping after <mark4>lunch</mark4><br>
yet fifteen hundred miles <mark4>north</mark4><br>
<br>
I heard and dropped a <mark4>dish.</mark4><br>
Your pain sunk talons in my skull <br>
and crouched there cawing, <mark4>heavy</mark4><br>
as a great vessel filled with <mark4>water,</mark4><br>
oil or blood, till suddenly next <mark1>day</mark1><br>
<br>
the weight lifted and I knew your <mark4>mind</mark4><br>
had guttered out like the Chanukah <br>
candles that burn so fast, <mark4>weeping</mark4><br>
veils of wax down the chanukiya. <br>
Those candles were laid <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
<br>
friends invited, ingredients <mark4>bought</mark4><br>
for latkes and apple <mark4>pancakes,</mark4><br>
that holiday for <mark4>liberation</mark4><br>
and the winter <mark4>solstice</mark4><br>
when tops turn like little <mark4>planets.</mark4><br>
<br>
Shall you have all or <mark4>nothing</mark4><br>
take half or pass by <mark4>untouched?</mark4><br>
Nothing you got, Nun said the <mark5>dreydl</mark5><br>
as the room stopped <mark4>spinning.</mark4><br>
The angel folded you up like <mark4>laundry</mark4><br>
<br>
your body thin as an empty <mark4>dress.</mark4><br>
Your clothes were <mark4>curtains</mark4><br>
hanging on the window of what <mark4>had</mark4><br>
been your flesh and now was <mark4>glass.</mark4><br>
Outside in Florida shopping <mark4>plazas</mark4><br>
<br>
loudspeakers blared Christmas <mark4>carols</mark4><br>
and palm trees were decked with <mark4>blinking</mark4><br>
lights. Except by the <mark4>tourist</mark4><br>
hotels, the beaches were <mark4>empty.</mark4><br>
Pelicans with pregnant <mark4>pouches</mark4><br>
<br>
flapped overhead like pterodactyls. <br>
In my mind I felt you die. <br>
First the pain lifted and <mark4>then</mark4><br>
you flickered and went <mark1>out.</mark1><br>
I walk through the rooms of <mark4>memory.</mark4><br>
<br>
Sometimes everything is shrouded in dropcloths, <br>
<br>
every chair ghostly and <mark4>muted.</mark4><br>
Other times memory lights up from <mark4>within</mark4><br>
bustling scenes acted just the other <mark4>side</mark4><br>
of a scrim through which surely I could <mark4>reach</mark4><br>
<br>
my fingers tearing at the flimsy <mark4>curtain</mark4><br>
of time which is and isn't and will <mark4>be</mark4><br>
the stuff of which we're made and <mark4>unmade.</mark4><br>
<br>
In sleep the other night I met you, <mark4>seventeen</mark4><br>
your first nasty marriage just <mark4>annulled,</mark4><br>
thin from your abortion, clutching a <mark4>book</mark4><br>
<br>
against your cheek and trying to <mark3>look</mark3><br>
older, trying to look middle <mark3>class,</mark3><br>
trying for a job at <mark4>Wanamaker's,</mark4><br>
<br>
dressing for parties in cast off <br>
stage costumes of your <mark4>sisters</mark4>, Your <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
were hazy with dreams. You did <mark4>not</mark4><br>
<br>
notice me waving as you <mark4>wandered</mark4><br>
past and I saw your slip was <mark4>showing.</mark4><br>
You stood still while I fixed your <mark4>clothes,</mark4><br>
<br>
as if I were your mother. Remember <mark3>me</mark3><br>
combing your springy black hair, ringlets <br>
that seemed metallic, <mark4>glittering;</mark4><br>
<br>
remember me dressing you, my seventy <mark1>year</mark1><br>
old mother who was my last dollbaby, <br>
giving you too late what your youth had <mark4>wanted.</mark4><br>
<br>
What is this mask of skin we <mark4>wear,</mark4><br>
what is this dress of <mark4>flesh,</mark4><br>
this coat of few colors and little <mark3>hair?</mark3><br>
<br>
This voluptuous seething heap of <mark4>desires</mark4><br>
<br>
and fears, squeaking mice turned <mark4>up</mark4><br>
in a steaming haystack with their <mark4>babies?</mark4><br>
This coat has been handed down, an <mark4>heirloom</mark4><br>
this coat of black hair and ample <mark1>flesh,</mark1><br>
<br>
this coat of pale slightly ruddy <mark4>skin.</mark4><br>
This set of hips and thighs, these <mark4>buttocks</mark4><br>
they provided cushioning for my <mark4>grandmother</mark4><br>
<br>
Hannah, for my mother Bert and for <mark1>me</mark1><br>
and we all sat on them in turn, those <mark4>major</mark4><br>
muscles on which we walk and walk and <mark4>walk</mark4><br>
<br>
over the earth in search of peace and <mark4>plenty.</mark4><br>
My mother is my mirror and I am <mark4>hers.</mark4><br>
What do we see? Our face grown young <mark4>again,</mark4><br>
<br>
our breasts grown firm, legs lean and <mark4>elegant.</mark4><br>
Our arms quivering with fat, <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
set in the bark of wrinkles, hands <mark4>puffy,</mark4><br>
<br>
our belly seamed with <mark4>childbearing,</mark4><br>
Give me your dress that I might try it <mark4>on.</mark4><br>
Oh it will not fit you mother, you are too <mark4>fat.</mark4><br>
<br>
I will not fit you <mark4>mother.</mark4><br>
I will not be the bride you can <mark1>dress,</mark1><br>
the obedient dutiful daughter you would <mark3>chew,</mark3><br>
<br>
a dog's leather bone to sharpen your <mark4>teeth.</mark4><br>
You strike me sometimes just to hear the <mark4>sound.</mark4><br>
Loneliness turns your fingers into <mark4>hooks</mark4><br>
<br>
barbed and drawing blood with their <mark4>caress.</mark4><br>
My twin, my sister, my lost love, <br>
I carry you in me like an embryo <br>
<br>
as once you carried <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
What is it we turn from, what is it we <mark4>fear?</mark4><br>
Did I truly think you could put me back <mark4>inside?</mark4><br>
<br>
Did I think I would fall into you as into a <mark4>molten</mark4><br>
furnace and be recast, that I would become <mark1>you?</mark1><br>
What did you fear in me, the child who <mark4>wore</mark4><br>
<br>
your <mark1>hair</mark1>, the woman who let that black <mark1>hair</mark1><br>
<br>
grow long as a banner of darkness, when <mark1>you</mark1><br>
a proper flapper wore yours <mark4>cropped?</mark4><br>
You pushed and you pulled on my <mark4>rubbery</mark4><br>
flesh, you kneaded me like a ball of <mark3>dough.</mark3><br>
Rise, rise, and then you pounded me <mark4>flat.</mark4><br>
<br>
Secretly the bones formed in the <mark4>bread.</mark4><br>
I became willful, private as a <mark3>cat.</mark3><br>
You never knew what alleys I had <mark1>wandered.</mark1><br>
You called me bad and I posed like a <mark4>gutter</mark4><br>
<br>
queen in a dress sewn of <mark4>knives.</mark4><br>
All I feared was being stuck in a <mark4>box</mark4><br>
with a lid. A good woman appeared to <mark1>me</mark1><br>
indistinguishable from a dead <mark4>one</mark4><br>
<br>
except that she worked all the <mark4>time.</mark4><br>
Your payday never came. Your dreams <mark4>ran</mark4><br>
with bright colors like Mexican <mark4>cottons</mark4><br>
that bled onto the drab sheets of the <mark1>day</mark1><br>
<br>
and would not bleach with <mark4>scrubbing.</mark4><br>
My dear, what you said was one <mark4>thing</mark4><br>
but what you sang was another, <mark4>sweetly</mark4><br>
subversive and dark as <mark4>blackberries</mark4><br>
<br>
and I became the daughter of your <mark4>dream.</mark4><br>
This body is your body, ashes now <br>
and roses, but alive in my eyes, my <mark4>breasts,</mark4><br>
my throat, my thighs. You run in <mark1>me</mark1><br>
<br>
a tang of salt in the creek waters of my <mark4>blood,</mark4><br>
you sing in my mind like wine. What <mark1>you</mark1><br>
did not dare in your life you dare in <mark4>mine.</mark4><br>
