Title : Town Eclogues: Thursday; the Bassette-Table <br>
Author : Lady Mary Wortley Montagu <br><br>

CARDELIA. THE bassette-table spread, the tallier <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
Why stays SMILINDA in the dressing-room <mark4>?</mark4><br>
Rise, pensive nymph ! the tallier stays for <mark3>you.</mark3><br>
<br>
SMILINDA. Ah ! Madam, since my SHARPER is <mark3>untrue,</mark3><br>
I joyless make my once ador'd alpieu.<br>
I saw him stand behind OMBRELIA's <mark3>Chair,</mark3><br>
And whisper with that soft deluding <mark3>air,</mark3><br>
And those feign'd sighs that cheat the list'ng fair <mark3>?</mark3><br>
<br>
CARDELIA. Is this the cause of your romantic strains <mark3>?</mark3><br>
A mightier grief my heavy heart <mark3>sustains.</mark3><br>
As you by love, so I by fortune <mark4>cross'd,</mark4><br>
In one bad deal three Septleva's I <mark4>lost.</mark4><br>
<br>
SMILINDA. Is that a grief which you compare with mine <mark3>?</mark3><br>
With ease the smiles of fortune I <mark3>resign.</mark3><br>
Wou'd all my gold in one bad deal were <mark4>gone,</mark4><br>
Were lovely SHARPFR <mark4>mine</mark4>, and mine <mark4>alone.</mark4><br>
<br>
CARDELIA. A lover lost, is but a common <mark3>care,</mark3><br>
And prudent nymphs against the change <mark3>prepare.</mark3><br>
The queen of Clubs thrice lost ! Oh ! who cou'd <mark3>guess</mark3><br>
This fatal stroke this unforeseen distress <mark3>!</mark3><br>
<br>
SMILINDA. See ! BETTY LOVEIT very a propos <mark5>!</mark5><br>
She all the pains of love and play does <mark3>know,</mark3><br>
Deeply experienc'd many years <mark3>ago.</mark3><br>
Dear BETTY shall th' important point <mark3>decide,</mark3><br>
BETTY, who oft the pains of each has try'd <mark4>:</mark4><br>
Impartial, she shall say who suffers <mark4>most,</mark4><br>
By cards, ill-usage, or by lovers <mark1>lost.</mark1><br>
<br>
LOVEIT. Tell, tell your griefs ; attentive will I <mark5>stay,</mark5><br>
Tho' time is precious, and I want some <mark5>tea.</mark5><br>
<br>
CARDELIA. Behold this equipage by MATHERS <mark4>wrought</mark4><br>
With fifty guineas (a great pen'orth !) bought <mark3>!</mark3><br>
See on the tooth-pick MARS and CUPID <mark5>strive,</mark5><br>
And both the struggling figures seem to liue.<br>
Upon the bottom see the Queen's bright face <mark4>;</mark4><br>
A myrtle foliage round the thimble case <mark3>;</mark3><br>
JOVE, JOVE himself does on the scissars <mark4>shine,</mark4><br>
The metal and the workmanship <mark3>divine.</mark3><br>
<br>
SMILINDA. This snuff-box once the pledge of SHARPER's <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
When rival beauties for the present <mark4>strove,</mark4><br>
(At CORTICELLI's he the raffle <mark4>won,</mark4><br>
There first his passion was in public shown <mark4>;</mark4><br>
HAZARDIA blush'd, and turn'd her head <mark3>aside,</mark3><br>
A rival's envy all in vain to <mark3>hide)</mark3><br>
This snuff-box ? on the hinge see diamonds shine <mark1>;</mark1><br>
This snuff-box will I stake, the prize is <mark1>mine.</mark1><br>
<br>
CARDELIA. Alas ! far lesser losses than I <mark3>bear,</mark3><br>
Have made a soldier sigh, a lover swear <mark3>:</mark3><br>
But oh ! what makes the disappointment <mark4>hard,</mark4><br>
'Twas my own Lord who drew the fatal card ! <mark3>?</mark3><br>
In complaisance I took the Queen he <mark4>gave,</mark4><br>
Tho' my own secret wish was for the Knave <mark3>:</mark3><br>
The Knave won son ecart that I had <mark4>chose,</mark4><br>
And the next pull my septleva I <mark4>lose.</mark4><br>
<br>
SMILINDA. But ah ! what aggravates the killing <mark4>smart,</mark4><br>
The cruel thought that stabs me to the <mark3>heart,</mark3><br>
This curs'd OMBRELIA, this undoing <mark1>fair,</mark1><br>
By whose vile arts this heavy grief I <mark1>bear,</mark1><br>
She, at whose name I shed these spiteful <mark4>tears,</mark4><br>
She owes to me, the very charms she wears <mark3>:</mark3><br>
An aukward thing when first she came to <mark4>town,</mark4><br>
Her shape unfinish'd and her face unknown <mark4>;</mark4><br>
She was my <mark4>friend</mark4>, I taught her first to <mark4>spread</mark4><br>
Upon her sallow cheeks enlivening <mark3>red,</mark3><br>
I introduc'd her to the park and <mark4>plays,</mark4><br>
And by my Interest COSINS made her stays <mark3>;</mark3><br>
Ungrateful wretch ! with mimick airs grown <mark4>pert,</mark4><br>
She dares to steal my favourite lover's <mark1>heart.</mark1><br>
<br>
CARDELIA. Wretch that I was ! how often have I <mark4>swore,</mark4><br>
When WINNALL tallied, I would punt no more <mark3>!</mark3><br>
I know the bite, yet to my ruin <mark4>run,</mark4><br>
And see the folly which I cannot <mark3>shun.</mark3><br>
<br>
SMILINDA. How many maids have SHARPER's vows deceiv'd <mark5>!</mark5><br>
How many curs'd the moment they believ'd !<br>
Yet, his known falshood could no warning prove <mark4>:</mark4><br>
Ah ! what are warnings to a maid in love <mark1>!</mark1><br>
<br>
CARDELIA. But of what marble must that breast be <mark4>form'd,</mark4><br>
Can gaze on Bassette, and remain unwarm'd ?<br>
When kings, queens, knaves are set in decent <mark3>rank,</mark3><br>
Expos'd in glorious heaps the tempting bank <mark3>!</mark3><br>
Guineas, half-guineas, all the shining <mark4>train,</mark4><br>
The Winner's pleasure and the Loser's pain <mark3>;</mark3><br>
In bright confusion open rouleaus <mark3>lie,</mark3><br>
They strike the soul, and glitter in the eye <mark3>;</mark3><br>
Fir'd by the sight, all reason I <mark3>disdain,</mark3><br>
My passions rise, and will not bear the rein <mark3>:</mark3><br>
Look upon <mark4>Bassette</mark4>, you who Reason <mark4>boast,</mark4><br>
And see if Reason may not there be lost <mark1>!</mark1><br>
<br>
SMILINDA. What more than marble must that breast <mark4>compose,</mark4><br>
That listens coldly to my SHARPER's vows <mark4>!</mark4><br>
Then when he trembles, when his blushes <mark4>rise,</mark4><br>
When awful Love seems melting in his eyes <mark3>!</mark3><br>
With eager beats his Mechlin cravat moves <mark4>:</mark4><br>
He loves, I whisper to myself, He loves <mark4>!</mark4><br>
Such unfeign'd passion in his look <mark4>appears,</mark4><br>
I lose all mem'ry of my former fears <mark3>;</mark3><br>
My panting heart confesses all his charms <mark4>;</mark4><br>
I yield at once, and sink into his <mark3>arms.</mark3><br>
Think of that <mark4>moment</mark4>, you who Prudence boast <mark1>!</mark1><br>
For such a <mark4>moment</mark4>, Prudence well were <mark1>lost.</mark1><br>
<br>
CARDELIA. At the Groom-porter's, batter'd bullies play <mark3>;</mark3><br>
Some Dukes at Marybon bowl time away <mark3>:</mark3><br>
But who the bowl or rattling dice <mark4>compares</mark4><br>
To Bassette's heavenly joys and pleasing cares <mark3>?</mark3><br>
<br>
SMILINDA. Soft SIMPLICETTA doats upon a beau <mark3>;</mark3><br>
PRUDINA likes a man, and laughs at show <mark3>:</mark3><br>
Their several graces in my SHARPER meet <mark4>;</mark4><br>
Strong as the footman, as the master <mark3>sweet.</mark3><br>
<br>
LOVEIT. Cease your contention, which has been too <mark3>long,</mark3><br>
I grow impatient, and the tea too strong <mark3>:</mark3><br>
<mark4>Attend</mark4>, and yield to what I now decide <mark1>;</mark1><br>
The equipage shall grace SMILINDA's side <mark3>;</mark3><br>
The snuff-box to CARDELIA I decree <mark3>;</mark3><br>
So leave complaining, and begin your <mark1>tea.</mark1><br>
