Title : She Dwelt among the Untrodden Ways <br>
Author : William Wordsworth <br><br>

She dwelt among the untrodden <mark3>ways</mark3><br>
Beside the springs of <mark3>Dove,</mark3><br>
A Maid whom there were none to <mark3>praise</mark3><br>
And very few to <mark3>love:</mark3><br>
<br>
A violet by a mossy <mark4>stone</mark4><br>
Half hidden from the <mark3>eye!</mark3><br>
--Fair as a star, when only <mark4>one</mark4><br>
Is shining in the <mark3>sky.</mark3><br>
<br>
She lived unknown, and few could <mark3>know</mark3><br>
When Lucy ceased to <mark3>be;</mark3><br>
But she is in her grave, and, <mark3>oh,</mark3><br>
The difference to <mark3>me!</mark3><br>
