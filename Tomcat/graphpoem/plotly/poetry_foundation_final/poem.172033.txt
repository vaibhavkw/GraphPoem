Title : from The Bridge: Quaker Hill <br>
Author : Hart Crane <br><br>

Perspective never withers from their <mark3>eyes;</mark3><br>
They keep that docile edict of the <mark3>Spring</mark3><br>
That blends March with August Antarctic <mark3>skies:</mark3><br>
These are but cows that see no other <mark3>thing</mark3><br>
Than grass and snow, and their own inner <mark4>being</mark4><br>
Through the rich halo that they do not <mark3>trouble</mark3><br>
Even to cast upon the seasons <mark4>fleeting</mark4><br>
Though they should thin and die on last year's <mark3>stubble.</mark3><br>
<br>
And they are awkward, ponderous and uncoy . . .    <br>
While we who press the cider mill, regarding <mark3>them--</mark3><br>
We, who with pledges taste the bright annoy   <br>
Of friendship's acid wine, retarding <mark3>phlegm,</mark3><br>
Shifting reprisals ('til who shall tell us <mark3>when</mark3><br>
The jest is too sharp to be kindly?) <mark3>boast</mark3><br>
Much of our store of faith in other <mark3>men</mark3><br>
Who would, ourselves, stalk down the merriest <mark3>ghost.</mark3><br>
<br>
Above them old Mizzentop, palatial <mark4>white</mark4><br>
Hostelry--floor by floor to cinquefoil <mark3>dormer</mark3><br>
Portholes the ceilings stack their stoic <mark3>height.</mark3><br>
Long tiers of windows staring out toward <mark3>former</mark3><br>
Faces--loose panes crown the hill and <mark4>gleam</mark4><br>
At sunset with a silent, cobwebbed patience . . <mark4>.</mark4><br>
<br>
See <mark4>them</mark4>, like eyes that still uphold some <mark3>dream</mark3><br>
Through mapled <mark4>vistas</mark4>, cancelled <mark4>reservations!</mark4><br>
<br>
High from the central cupola, they <mark3>say</mark3><br>
One's glance could cross the borders of three <mark4>states;</mark4><br>
But I have seen death's stare in slow <mark3>survey</mark3><br>
From four horizons that no one relates . . <mark3>.</mark3><br>
Weekenders avid of their turf-won <mark4>scores,</mark4><br>
Here three hours from the semaphores, the <mark4>Czars</mark4><br>
Of golf, by twos and threes in plaid plusfours   <br>
Alight with sticks abristle and <mark3>cigars.</mark3><br>
<br>
This was the Promised Land, and still it <mark4>is</mark4><br>
To the persuasive suburban land <mark4>agent</mark4><br>
In bootleg roadhouses where the gin <mark3>fizz</mark3><br>
Bubbles in time to Hollywood's new love-nest <mark4>pageant.</mark4><br>
Fresh from the radio in the old Meeting <mark4>House</mark4><br>
(Now the New Avalon Hotel) volcanoes <mark3>roar</mark3><br>
A welcome to highsteppers that no <mark3>mouse</mark3><br>
Who saw the Friends there ever heard <mark3>before.</mark3><br>
<br>
What cunning neighbors history has in <mark4>fine!</mark4><br>
The woodlouse mortgages the ancient <mark4>deal</mark4><br>
Table that Powitzky buys for only <mark3>nine-</mark3><br>
Ty-five at Adams' auction,--eats the <mark3>seal,</mark3><br>
The spinster polish of antiquity . . <mark4>.</mark4><br>
Who holds the lease on time and on <mark4>disgrace?</mark4><br>
What eats the pattern with <mark4>ubiquity?</mark4><br>
Where are my kinsmen and the patriarch <mark3>race?</mark3><br>
<br>
The resigned factions of the dead <mark3>preside.</mark3><br>
Dead rangers bled their comfort on the <mark3>snow;</mark3><br>
But I must ask slain Iroquois to <mark3>guide</mark3><br>
Me farther than scalped Yankees knew to <mark3>go:</mark3><br>
Shoulder the curse of sundered <mark4>parentage,</mark4><br>
Wait for the postman driving from Birch <mark4>Hill</mark4><br>
With birthright by blackmail, the arrant <mark4>page</mark4><br>
That unfolds a new destiny to fill . . . <mark3>.</mark3><br>
<br>
So, must we from the hawk's far stemming <mark3>view,</mark3><br>
Must we descend as worm's eye to <mark3>construe</mark3><br>
Our love of all we touch, and take it to the <mark4>Gate</mark4><br>
As humbly as a guest who knows himself too <mark3>late,</mark3><br>
His news already told? Yes, while the heart is <mark4>wrung,</mark4><br>
Arise--yes, take this sheaf of dust upon your <mark3>tongue!</mark3><br>
In one last angelus lift throbbing <mark4>throat--</mark4><br>
Listen, transmuting silence with that stilly <mark3>note</mark3><br>
<br>
Of pain that Emily, that Isadora <mark3>knew!</mark3><br>
While high from dim elm-chancels hung with <mark3>dew,</mark3><br>
That triple-noted clause of <mark4>moonlight--</mark4><br>
Yes, whip-poor-will, unhusks the heart of <mark4>fright,</mark4><br>
Breaks us and saves, yes, breaks the heart, yet <mark4>yields</mark4><br>
That patience that is armour and that <mark3>shields</mark3><br>
Love from despair--when love forsees the <mark4>end--</mark4><br>
Leaf after autumnal <mark4>leaf</mark4><br>
break <mark4>off,</mark4><br>
