Title : Paradise Regain'd: Book 4 (1671 version) <br>
Author : John Milton <br><br>

PErplex'd and troubl'd at his bad <mark4>success</mark4><br>
The Tempter stood, nor had what to <mark5>reply,</mark5><br>
Discover'd in his fraud, thrown from his <mark4>hope,</mark4><br>
So oft, and the perswasive <mark4>Rhetoric</mark4><br>
That sleek't his tongue, and won so much on <mark1>Eve,</mark1><br>
So little here, nay lost; but Eve was <mark1>Eve,</mark1><br>
This far his over-match, who self <mark5>deceiv'd</mark5><br>
And rash, before-hand had no better <mark4>weigh'd</mark4><br>
The strength he was to cope with, or his <mark4>own:</mark4><br>
But as a man who had been matchless <mark4>held</mark4><br>
In cunning, over-reach't where least he <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
To salve his <mark4>credit</mark4>, and for very <mark4>spight</mark4><br>
Still will be tempting him who foyls him <mark3>still,</mark3><br>
And never cease, though to his shame the <mark4>more;</mark4><br>
Or as a swarm of flies in vintage <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
About the wine-press where sweet moust is <mark5>powr'd,</mark5><br>
Beat off, returns as oft with humming <mark4>sound;</mark4><br>
Or surging waves against a solid <mark4>rock,</mark4><br>
Though all to shivers dash't, the assault <mark3>renew,</mark3><br>
Vain battry, and in froth or bubbles <mark4>end;</mark4><br>
So Satan, whom repulse upon <mark4>repulse</mark4><br>
Met ever; and to shameful silence <mark4>brought,</mark4><br>
Yet gives not o're though desperate of <mark1>success,</mark1><br>
And his vain importunity <mark4>pursues.</mark4><br>
He brought our Saviour to the western <mark4>side</mark4><br>
Of that high mountain, whence he might <mark4>behold</mark4><br>
Another plain, long but in bredth not <mark4>wide;</mark4><br>
Wash'd by the Southern Sea, and on the <mark4>North</mark4><br>
To equal length back'd with a ridge of <mark4>hills</mark4><br>
That screen'd the fruits of the earth and seats of <mark4>men</mark4><br>
From cold Septentrion blasts, thence in the <mark4>midst</mark4><br>
Divided by a river, of whose <mark4>banks</mark4><br>
On each side an Imperial City <mark4>stood,</mark4><br>
With Towers and Temples proudly <mark4>elevate</mark4><br>
On seven small <mark4>Hills</mark4>, with Palaces <mark4>adorn'd,</mark4><br>
Porches and Theatres, <mark4>Baths</mark4>, <mark4>Aqueducts,</mark4><br>
Statues and Trophees, and Triumphal <mark4>Arcs,</mark4><br>
Gardens and Groves presented to his <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
Above the highth of Mountains <mark5>interpos'd.</mark5><br>
By what strange Parallax or Optic <mark3>skill</mark3><br>
Of vision multiplyed through air, or <mark4>glass</mark4><br>
Of Telescope, were curious to <mark4>enquire:</mark4><br>
And now the Tempter thus his silence <mark4>broke.</mark4><br>
The City which thou seest no other <mark4>deem</mark4><br>
Then great and glorious Rome, Queen of the <mark4>Earth</mark4><br>
So far renown'd, and with the spoils enricht <br>
Of Nations; there the Capitol thou <mark5>seest</mark5><br>
Above the rest lifting his stately <mark4>head</mark4><br>
On the Tarpeian rock, her Cittadel <br>
Impregnable, and there Mount <mark4>Palatine</mark4><br>
The Imperial Palace, compass huge, and <mark3>high</mark3><br>
The Structure, skill of noblest <mark4>Architects,</mark4><br>
With gilded battlements, conspicuous <mark4>far,</mark4><br>
Turrets and Terrases, and glittering <mark4>Spires.</mark4><br>
Many a fair Edifice besides, more <mark4>like</mark4><br>
Houses of Gods (so well I have <mark5>dispos'd</mark5><br>
My Aerie Microscope) thou may'st <mark1>behold</mark1><br>
Outside and inside both, pillars and <mark4>roofs</mark4><br>
Carv'd work, the hand of fam'd <mark5>Artificers</mark5><br>
In Cedar, Marble, Ivory or <mark3>Gold.</mark3><br>
Thence to the gates cast round thine eye, and <mark5>see</mark5><br>
What conflux issuing forth, or entring <mark4>in,</mark4><br>
Pretors, Proconsuls to thir <mark4>Provinces</mark4><br>
Hasting or on return, in robes of <mark4>State;</mark4><br>
Lictors and rods the ensigns of thir <mark4>power,</mark4><br>
Legions and Cohorts, turmes of horse and <mark4>wings:</mark4><br>
Or Embassies from Regions far <mark4>remote</mark4><br>
In various habits on the Appian <mark4>road,</mark4><br>
Or on the AEmilian, some from farthest <mark4>South,</mark4><br>
Syene, and where the shadow both way <mark4>falls,</mark4><br>
Meroe Nilotic Isle, and more to <mark4>West,</mark4><br>
The Realm of Bocchus to the Black-moor <mark2>Sea;</mark2><br>
From the Asian Kings and Parthian among <mark4>these,</mark4><br>
From India and the golden Chersoness, <br>
And utmost Indian Isle Taprobane, <br>
Dusk faces with white silken Turbants <mark4>wreath'd:</mark4><br>
From Gallia, Gades, and the Brittish <mark1>West,</mark1><br>
Germans and Scythians, and Sarmatians <mark1>North</mark1><br>
Beyond Danubius to the Tauric <mark4>Pool.</mark4><br>
All Nations now to Rome obedience <mark3>pay,</mark3><br>
To Rome's great Emperour, whose wide <mark4>domain</mark4><br>
In ample Territory, wealth and <mark1>power,</mark1><br>
Civility of Manners, Arts, and <mark4>Arms,</mark4><br>
And long Renown thou justly may'st <mark1>prefer</mark1><br>
Before the Parthian; these two Thrones <mark4>except,</mark4><br>
The rest are barbarous, and scarce worth the <mark4>sight,</mark4><br>
Shar'd among petty Kings too far <mark5>remov'd;</mark5><br>
These having shewn thee, I have shewn thee <mark4>all</mark4><br>
The Kingdoms of the world, and all thir <mark4>glory.</mark4><br>
This Emperour hath no Son, and now is <mark4>old,</mark4><br>
Old, and lascivious, and from Rome <mark5>retir'd</mark5><br>
To Capreae an Island small but <mark4>strong</mark4><br>
On the Campanian <mark4>shore</mark4>, with purpose <mark4>there</mark4><br>
His horrid lusts in private to enjoy, <br>
Committing to a wicked <mark4>Favourite</mark4><br>
All publick cares, and yet of him <mark4>suspicious,</mark4><br>
Hated of all, and hating; with what <mark4>ease</mark4><br>
Indu'd with Regal Vertues as thou <mark4>art,</mark4><br>
Appearing, and beginning noble <mark4>deeds,</mark4><br>
Might'st thou expel this monster from his <mark4>Throne</mark4><br>
Now made a stye, and in his place <mark4>ascending</mark4><br>
A victor, people free from servile <mark4>yoke?</mark4><br>
And with my help thou may'st; to me the <mark1>power</mark1><br>
Is given, and by that right I give it <mark3>thee.</mark3><br>
Aim therefore at no less then all the <mark4>world,</mark4><br>
Aim at the highest, without the highest <mark4>attain'd</mark4><br>
Will be for thee no <mark4>sitting</mark4>, or not <mark4>long</mark4><br>
On David's Throne, be propheci'd what <mark4>will.</mark4><br>
To whom the Son of God unmov'd <mark4>reply'd.</mark4><br>
Nor doth this grandeur and majestic <mark5>show</mark5><br>
Of luxury, though call'd magnificence, <br>
More then of arms before, allure mine <mark3>eye,</mark3><br>
Much less my mind; though thou should'st add to <mark4>tell</mark4><br>
Thir sumptuous gluttonies, and gorgeous <mark4>feasts</mark4><br>
On Cittron tables or Atlantic <mark3>stone;</mark3><br>
(For I have also <mark4>heard</mark4>, perhaps have <mark4>read)</mark4><br>
Their wines of Setia, Cales, and Falerne, <br>
Chios and Creet, and how they quaff in <mark1>Gold,</mark1><br>
Crystal and Myrrhine cups imboss'd with <mark4>Gems</mark4><br>
And studs of Pearl, to me should'st tell who <mark4>thirst</mark4><br>
And hunger still: then Embassies thou <mark4>shew'st</mark4><br>
From Nations far and nigh; what honour <mark4>that,</mark4><br>
But tedious wast of time to sit and <mark4>hear</mark4><br>
So many hollow complements and <mark4>lies,</mark4><br>
Outlandish flatteries? then proceed'st to <mark4>talk</mark4><br>
Of the Emperour, how easily <mark5>subdu'd,</mark5><br>
How gloriously; I shall, thou say'st, <mark3>expel</mark3><br>
A brutish monster: what if I <mark5>withal</mark5><br>
Expel a Devil who first made him <mark5>such?</mark5><br>
Let his tormenter Conscience find him <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
For him I was not sent, nor yet to <mark3>free</mark3><br>
That people victor <mark4>once</mark4>, now vile and <mark4>base,</mark4><br>
Deservedly made vassal, who once <mark4>just,</mark4><br>
Frugal, and mild, and temperate, conquer'd <mark3>well,</mark3><br>
But govern ill the Nations under <mark1>yoke,</mark1><br>
Peeling thir Provinces, exhausted <mark1>all</mark1><br>
By lust and rapine; first ambitious <mark3>grown</mark3><br>
Of triumph that insulting <mark4>vanity;</mark4><br>
Then cruel, by thir sports to blood enur'd <br>
Of fighting beasts, and men to beasts <mark4>expos'd,</mark4><br>
Luxurious by thir wealth, and greedier <mark1>still,</mark1><br>
And from the daily Scene <mark4>effeminate.</mark4><br>
What wise and valiant man would seek to <mark1>free</mark1><br>
These thus degenerate, by themselves <mark5>enslav'd,</mark5><br>
Or could of inward slaves make outward <mark1>free?</mark1><br>
Know therefore when my season comes to <mark4>sit</mark4><br>
On David's Throne, it shall be like a <mark3>tree</mark3><br>
Spreading and over-shadowing all the <mark1>Earth,</mark1><br>
Or as a stone that shall to pieces dash <br>
All Monarchies besides throughout the <mark1>world,</mark1><br>
And of my Kingdom there shall be no <mark1>end:</mark1><br>
Means there shall be to this, but what the <mark4>means,</mark4><br>
Is not for thee to know, nor me to <mark1>tell.</mark1><br>
To whom the Tempter impudent <mark5>repli'd.</mark5><br>
I see all offers made by me how <mark4>slight</mark4><br>
Thou valu'st, because <mark4>offer'd</mark4>, and <mark4>reject'st:</mark4><br>
Nothing will please the difficult and <mark4>nice,</mark4><br>
Or nothing more then still to <mark4>contradict:</mark4><br>
On the other side know also thou, that <mark2>I</mark2><br>
On what I offer set as high <mark3>esteem,</mark3><br>
Nor what I part with mean to give for <mark4>naught;</mark4><br>
All these which in a moment thou <mark4>behold'st,</mark4><br>
The Kingdoms of the world to thee I <mark4>give;</mark4><br>
For giv'n to me, I give to whom I <mark4>please,</mark4><br>
No trifle; yet with this reserve, not <mark4>else,</mark4><br>
On this <mark4>condition</mark4>, if thou wilt fall <mark4>down,</mark4><br>
And worship me as thy superior <mark4>Lord,</mark4><br>
Easily done, and hold them all of <mark3>me;</mark3><br>
For what can less so great a gift <mark4>deserve?</mark4><br>
Whom thus our Saviour answer'd with <mark4>disdain.</mark4><br>
I never lik'd thy talk, thy offers <mark4>less,</mark4><br>
Now both abhor, since thou hast dar'd to <mark4>utter</mark4><br>
The abominable terms, impious <mark4>condition;</mark4><br>
But I endure the time, till which <mark5>expir'd,</mark5><br>
Thou hast permission on me.   It is <mark4>written</mark4><br>
The first of all Commandments, Thou shalt <mark4>worship</mark4><br>
The Lord thy God, and only him shalt <mark3>serve;</mark3><br>
And dar'st thou to the Son of God <mark4>propound</mark4><br>
To worship thee <mark1>accurst</mark1>, now more <mark1>accurst</mark1><br>
For this attempt bolder then that on <mark1>Eve,</mark1><br>
And more blasphemous? which expect to <mark3>rue.</mark3><br>
The Kingdoms of the world to thee were <mark5>giv'n,</mark5><br>
Permitted rather, and by thee <mark4>usurp't,</mark4><br>
Other donation none thou canst <mark4>produce:</mark4><br>
If given, by whom but by the King of <mark4>Kings,</mark4><br>
God over all supreme? if giv'n to <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
By thee how fairly is the Giver <mark1>now</mark1><br>
Repaid?   But gratitude in thee is <mark4>lost</mark4><br>
Long since.   Wert thou so void of fear or <mark4>shame,</mark4><br>
As offer them to me the Son of <mark4>God,</mark4><br>
To me my own, on such abhorred <mark4>pact,</mark4><br>
That I fall down and worship thee as <mark1>God?</mark1><br>
Get thee behind me; plain thou now <mark4>appear'st</mark4><br>
That Evil one, Satan for ever <mark4>damn'd.</mark4><br>
To whom the Fiend with fear abasht <mark1>reply'd.</mark1><br>
Be not so sore <mark4>offended</mark4>, Son of <mark1>God;</mark1><br>
Though Sons of God both Angels are and <mark1>Men,</mark1><br>
If I to try whether in higher <mark4>sort</mark4><br>
Then these thou bear'st that title, have <mark5>propos'd</mark5><br>
What both from Men and Angels I <mark3>receive,</mark3><br>
Tetrarchs of fire, air, flood, and on the <mark1>earth</mark1><br>
Nations besides from all the quarter'd <mark4>winds,</mark4><br>
God of this world invok't and world <mark4>beneath;</mark4><br>
Who then thou art, whose coming is <mark4>foretold</mark4><br>
To me so fatal, me it most <mark4>concerns.</mark4><br>
The tryal hath indamag'd thee no <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
Rather more honour left and more <mark1>esteem;</mark1><br>
Me naught advantag'd, missing what I <mark4>aim'd.</mark4><br>
Therefore let pass, as they are <mark4>transitory,</mark4><br>
The Kingdoms of this world; I shall no <mark1>more</mark1><br>
Advise thee, gain them as thou canst, or <mark4>not.</mark4><br>
And thou thy self seem'st otherwise <mark5>inclin'd</mark5><br>
Then to a worldly Crown, addicted <mark1>more</mark1><br>
To contemplation and profound <mark4>dispute,</mark4><br>
As by that early action may be judg'd, <br>
When slipping from thy Mothers eye thou <mark4>went'st</mark4><br>
Alone into the Temple; there was <mark4>found</mark4><br>
Among the gravest Rabbies <mark5>disputant</mark5><br>
On points and questions fitting Moses <mark4>Chair,</mark4><br>
Teaching not taught; the childhood shews the <mark4>man,</mark4><br>
As morning shews the day.   Be famous <mark4>then</mark4><br>
By wisdom; as thy Empire must <mark4>extend,</mark4><br>
So let extend thy mind o're all the <mark1>world,</mark1><br>
In knowledge, all things in it <mark4>comprehend,</mark4><br>
All knowledge is not couch't in Moses <mark3>Law,</mark3><br>
The Pentateuch or what the Prophets <mark4>wrote,</mark4><br>
The Gentiles also know, and write, and <mark4>teach</mark4><br>
To admiration, led by Natures <mark4>light;</mark4><br>
And with the Gentiles much thou must <mark4>converse,</mark4><br>
Ruling them by perswasion as thou <mark4>mean'st,</mark4><br>
Without thir learning how wilt thou with <mark4>them,</mark4><br>
Or they with thee hold conversation <mark4>meet?</mark4><br>
How wilt thou reason with them, how <mark4>refute</mark4><br>
Thir Idolisms, <mark4>Traditions</mark4>, <mark4>Paradoxes?</mark4><br>
Error by his own arms is best evinc't. <br>
Look once more e're we leave this specular <mark4>Mount</mark4><br>
Westward, much nearer by Southwest, <mark1>behold</mark1><br>
Where on the AEgean shore a City <mark4>stands</mark4><br>
Built nobly, pure the air, and light the <mark4>soil,</mark4><br>
Athens the eye of <mark4>Greece</mark4>, Mother of <mark4>Arts</mark4><br>
And <mark4>Eloquence</mark4>, native to famous <mark4>wits</mark4><br>
Or hospitable, in her sweet <mark4>recess,</mark4><br>
City or Suburban, studious walks and <mark4>shades;</mark4><br>
See there the Olive Grove of <mark4>Academe,</mark4><br>
Plato's retirement, where the Attic <mark4>Bird</mark4><br>
Trills her thick-warbl'd notes the summer <mark1>long,</mark1><br>
There flowrie hill Hymettus with the <mark1>sound</mark1><br>
Of Bees industrious murmur oft <mark4>invites</mark4><br>
To studious musing; there Ilissus <mark5>rouls</mark5><br>
His whispering stream; within the walls then <mark3>view</mark3><br>
The schools of antient Sages; his who <mark4>bred</mark4><br>
Great Alexander to subdue the <mark1>world,</mark1><br>
Lyceum there, and painted Stoa <mark4>next:</mark4><br>
There thou shalt hear and learn the secret <mark1>power</mark1><br>
Of harmony in tones and numbers <mark4>hit</mark4><br>
By voice or hand, and various-measur'd <mark4>verse,</mark4><br>
AEolian charms and Dorian Lyric <mark4>Odes,</mark4><br>
And his who gave them breath, but higher <mark4>sung,</mark4><br>
Blind Melesigenes thence Homer <mark4>call'd,</mark4><br>
Whose Poem Phoebus challeng'd for his <mark1>own.</mark1><br>
Thence what the lofty grave Tragoedians <mark4>taught</mark4><br>
In Chorus or Iambic, teachers <mark4>best</mark4><br>
Of moral prudence, with delight <mark5>receiv'd</mark5><br>
In brief sententious precepts, while they <mark4>treat</mark4><br>
Of fate, and chance, and change in human <mark1>life;</mark1><br>
High actions, and high passions best <mark4>describing:</mark4><br>
Thence to the famous Orators <mark3>repair,</mark3><br>
Those antient, whose resistless <mark4>eloquence</mark4><br>
Wielded at will that fierce Democratie, <br>
Shook the Arsenal and fulmin'd over <mark4>Greece,</mark4><br>
To Macedon, and Artaxerxes <mark1>Throne;</mark1><br>
To sage Philosophy next lend thine <mark4>ear,</mark4><br>
From Heaven descended to the low-rooft <mark4>house</mark4><br>
Of Socrates, see there his <mark4>Tenement,</mark4><br>
Whom well inspir'd the Oracle <mark5>pronounc'd</mark5><br>
Wisest of men; from whose mouth issu'd <mark4>forth</mark4><br>
Mellifluous streams that water'd all the <mark4>schools</mark4><br>
Of Academics old and new, with <mark4>those</mark4><br>
Sirnam'd Peripatetics, and the <mark4>Sect</mark4><br>
Epicurean, and the Stoic <mark3>severe;</mark3><br>
These here revolve, or, as thou lik'st, at <mark4>home,</mark4><br>
Till time mature thee to a Kingdom's waight; <br>
These rules will render thee a King <mark5>compleat</mark5><br>
Within thy self, much more with Empire <mark1>joyn'd.</mark1><br>
To whom our Saviour sagely thus <mark1>repli'd.</mark1><br>
Think not but that I know these things, or <mark4>think</mark4><br>
I know them <mark4>not</mark4>, not therefore am I <mark4>short</mark4><br>
Of knowing what I aught: he who <mark4>receives</mark4><br>
Light from above, from the fountain of <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
No other doctrine needs, though granted <mark3>true;</mark3><br>
But these are false, or little else but <mark4>dreams,</mark4><br>
Conjectures, fancies, built on nothing <mark4>firm.</mark4><br>
The first and wisest of them all <mark4>profess'd</mark4><br>
To know this only, that he nothing <mark3>knew;</mark3><br>
The next to fabling fell and smooth <mark5>conceits,</mark5><br>
A third sort doubted all things, though plain <mark1>sence;</mark1><br>
Others in vertue plac'd <mark4>felicity,</mark4><br>
But vertue joyn'd with riches and long <mark1>life,</mark1><br>
In corporal pleasure he, and careless <mark1>ease,</mark1><br>
The Stoic last in Philosophic <mark4>pride,</mark4><br>
By him call'd vertue; and his vertuous <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
Wise, perfect in himself, and all <mark4>possessing</mark4><br>
Equal to God, oft shames not to <mark1>prefer,</mark1><br>
As fearing God nor man, contemning <mark1>all</mark1><br>
Wealth, pleasure, pain or torment, death and <mark1>life,</mark1><br>
Which when he lists, he leaves, or boasts he <mark3>can,</mark3><br>
For all his tedious talk is but vain <mark4>boast,</mark4><br>
Or subtle shifts conviction to <mark4>evade.</mark4><br>
Alas what can they teach, and not <mark4>mislead;</mark4><br>
Ignorant of themselves, of God much <mark1>more,</mark1><br>
And how the world began, and how man <mark4>fell</mark4><br>
Degraded by himself, on grace <mark4>depending?</mark4><br>
Much of the Soul they talk, but all awrie, <br>
And in themselves seek vertue, and to <mark4>themselves</mark4><br>
All glory arrogate, to God give <mark4>none,</mark4><br>
Rather accuse him under usual <mark4>names,</mark4><br>
Fortune and <mark4>Fate</mark4>, as one regardless <mark4>quite</mark4><br>
Of mortal <mark4>things</mark4>, Who therefore seeks in <mark1>these</mark1><br>
True wisdom, finds her not, or by <mark4>delusion</mark4><br>
Far <mark4>worse</mark4>, her false resemblance only <mark4>meets,</mark4><br>
An empty cloud.   However many <mark4>books</mark4><br>
Wise men have said are wearisom; who <mark4>reads</mark4><br>
Incessantly, and to his reading brings <mark1>not</mark1><br>
A spirit and judgment equal or <mark4>superior,</mark4><br>
(And what he brings, what needs he elsewhere <mark4>seek)</mark4><br>
Uncertain and unsettl'd still <mark4>remains,</mark4><br>
Deep verst in books and shallow in <mark4>himself,</mark4><br>
Crude or intoxicate, collecting <mark4>toys,</mark4><br>
And trifles for choice matters, worth a spunge; <br>
As Children gathering pibles on the <mark3>shore.</mark3><br>
Or if I would delight my private <mark4>hours</mark4><br>
With Music or with Poem, where so <mark4>soon</mark4><br>
As in our native Language can I <mark4>find</mark4><br>
That solace?   All our Law and Story <mark4>strew'd</mark4><br>
With Hymns, our Psalms with artful terms inscrib'd, <br>
Our Hebrew Songs and Harps in <mark4>Babylon,</mark4><br>
That pleas'd so well our Victors <mark4>ear</mark4>, <mark4>declare</mark4><br>
That rather Greece from us these Arts deriv'd; <br>
Ill imitated, while they loudest <mark4>sing</mark4><br>
The vices of thir Deities, and thir <mark1>own</mark1><br>
In Fable, Hymn, or Song, so personating <br>
Thir Gods ridiculous, and themselves past <mark1>shame.</mark1><br>
Remove their swelling Epithetes thick <mark4>laid</mark4><br>
As varnish on a Harlots cheek, the <mark4>rest,</mark4><br>
Thin sown with aught of profit or <mark4>delight,</mark4><br>
Will far be found unworthy to <mark3>compare</mark3><br>
With Sion's songs, to all true tasts <mark4>excelling,</mark4><br>
Where God is prais'd aright, and Godlike <mark1>men,</mark1><br>
The Holiest of Holies, and his <mark4>Saints;</mark4><br>
Such are from God inspir'd, not such from <mark1>thee;</mark1><br>
Unless where moral vertue is <mark4>express't</mark4><br>
By light of Nature not in all quite <mark1>lost.</mark1><br>
Thir Orators thou then extoll'st, as <mark1>those</mark1><br>
The top of Eloquence, Statists <mark4>indeed,</mark4><br>
And lovers of thir Country, as may <mark4>seem;</mark4><br>
But herein to our Prophets far <mark1>beneath,</mark1><br>
As men divinely taught, and better <mark4>teaching</mark4><br>
The solid rules of Civil <mark4>Government</mark4><br>
In thir majestic unaffected <mark4>stile</mark4><br>
Then all the Oratory of Greece and <mark4>Rome.</mark4><br>
In them is plainest <mark4>taught</mark4>, and easiest <mark4>learnt,</mark4><br>
What makes a Nation happy, and keeps it <mark3>so,</mark3><br>
What ruins Kingdoms, and lays Cities <mark4>flat;</mark4><br>
These only with our Law best form a <mark4>King.</mark4><br>
So spake the Son of God; but Satan <mark1>now</mark1><br>
Quite at a loss, for all his darts were <mark4>spent,</mark4><br>
Thus to our Saviour with stern brow <mark1>reply'd.</mark1><br>
Since neither wealth, nor honour, arms nor <mark1>arts,</mark1><br>
Kingdom nor Empire pleases thee, nor <mark4>aught</mark4><br>
By me propos'd in life <mark4>contemplative,</mark4><br>
Or active, tended on by glory, or <mark4>fame,</mark4><br>
What dost thou in this World? the <mark4>Wilderness</mark4><br>
For thee is fittest place, I found thee <mark1>there,</mark1><br>
And thither will return thee, yet <mark4>remember</mark4><br>
What I foretell thee, soon thou shalt have <mark4>cause</mark4><br>
To wish thou never hadst rejected <mark4>thus</mark4><br>
Nicely or cautiously my offer'd <mark4>aid,</mark4><br>
Which would have set thee in short time with <mark1>ease</mark1><br>
On David's Throne; or Throne of all the <mark1>world,</mark1><br>
Now at full age, fulness of time, thy <mark4>season,</mark4><br>
When Prophesies of thee are best fullfill'd. <br>
Now contrary, if I read aught in <mark4>Heaven,</mark4><br>
Or Heav'n write aught of Fate, by what the <mark4>Stars</mark4><br>
Voluminous, or single <mark4>characters,</mark4><br>
In their conjunction met, give me to <mark4>spell,</mark4><br>
Sorrows, and labours, opposition, <mark4>hate,</mark4><br>
Attends thee, scorns, reproaches, <mark4>injuries,</mark4><br>
Violence and stripes, and lastly cruel <mark4>death,</mark4><br>
A Kingdom they portend thee, but what <mark4>Kingdom,</mark4><br>
Real or Allegoric I discern <mark1>not,</mark1><br>
Nor when, eternal sure, as without <mark1>end,</mark1><br>
Without beginning; for no date <mark5>prefixt</mark5><br>
Directs me in the Starry Rubric <mark4>set.</mark4><br>
So saying he took (for still he knew his <mark1>power</mark1><br>
Not yet expir'd) and to the <mark1>Wilderness</mark1><br>
Brought back the Son of God, and left him <mark1>there,</mark1><br>
Feigning to disappear.   Darkness now <mark4>rose,</mark4><br>
As day-light sunk, and brought in lowring <mark4>night</mark4><br>
Her shadowy off-spring unsubstantial <mark4>both,</mark4><br>
Privation meer of light and absent <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
Our Saviour meek and with untroubl'd <mark4>mind</mark4><br>
After his aerie jaunt, though hurried <mark4>sore,</mark4><br>
Hungry and cold betook him to his <mark1>rest,</mark1><br>
Wherever, under some concourse of <mark1>shades</mark1><br>
Whose branching arms thick intertwind might <mark4>shield</mark4><br>
From dews and damps of night his shelter'd <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
But shelter'd slept in vain, for at his <mark1>head</mark1><br>
The Tempter <mark4>watch'd</mark4>, and soon with ugly <mark1>dreams</mark1><br>
Disturb'd his sleep; and either Tropic <mark1>now</mark1><br>
Gan thunder, and both ends of Heav'n, the <mark4>Clouds</mark4><br>
From many a horrid rift abortive <mark4>pour'd</mark4><br>
Fierce rain with lightning mixt, water with <mark4>fire</mark4><br>
In ruine reconcil'd: nor slept the <mark1>winds</mark1><br>
Within thir stony caves, but rush'd <mark4>abroad</mark4><br>
From the four hinges of the world, and <mark1>fell</mark1><br>
On the vext Wilderness, whose tallest <mark4>Pines,</mark4><br>
Though rooted deep as high, and sturdiest <mark4>Oaks</mark4><br>
Bow'd their Stiff <mark4>necks</mark4>, loaden with stormy <mark4>blasts,</mark4><br>
Or torn up sheer: ill wast thou shrouded <mark1>then,</mark1><br>
O patient Son of God, yet only <mark5>stoodst</mark5><br>
Unshaken; nor yet staid the terror <mark1>there,</mark1><br>
Infernal Ghosts, and Hellish Furies, <mark4>round</mark4><br>
Environ'd thee, some howl'd, some <mark4>yell'd</mark4>, some <mark4>shriek'd,</mark4><br>
Some bent at thee thir fiery darts, while <mark3>thou</mark3><br>
Sat'st unappall'd in calm and sinless <mark4>peace.</mark4><br>
Thus pass'd the night so foul till morning <mark3>fair</mark3><br>
Came forth with Pilgrim steps in amice <mark3>gray;</mark3><br>
Who with her radiant finger still'd the <mark4>roar</mark4><br>
Of thunder, chas'd the <mark4>clouds</mark4>, and laid the <mark1>winds,</mark1><br>
And grisly Spectres, which the Fiend had <mark4>rais'd</mark4><br>
To tempt the Son of God with terrors <mark4>dire.</mark4><br>
And now the Sun with more effectual <mark4>beams</mark4><br>
Had chear'd the face of Earth, and dry'd the <mark4>wet</mark4><br>
From drooping plant, or dropping tree; the <mark4>birds</mark4><br>
Who all things now behold more fresh and <mark4>green,</mark4><br>
After a night of storm so <mark4>ruinous,</mark4><br>
Clear'd up their choicest notes in bush and <mark3>spray</mark3><br>
To gratulate the sweet return of <mark4>morn;</mark4><br>
Nor yet amidst this joy and brightest <mark1>morn</mark1><br>
Was absent, after all his mischief <mark4>done,</mark4><br>
The Prince of darkness, glad would also <mark1>seem</mark1><br>
Of this fair change, and to our Saviour <mark4>came,</mark4><br>
Yet with no new device, they all were <mark1>spent,</mark1><br>
Rather by this his last affront <mark5>resolv'd,</mark5><br>
Desperate of better course, to vent his rage, <br>
And mad despight to be so oft <mark5>repell'd.</mark5><br>
Him walking on a Sunny hill he <mark1>found,</mark1><br>
Back'd on the North and West by a thick <mark4>wood,</mark4><br>
Out of the wood he starts in wonted <mark4>shape;</mark4><br>
And in a careless mood thus to him <mark4>said.</mark4><br>
Fair morning yet betides thee Son of <mark1>God,</mark1><br>
After a dismal night; I heard the <mark4>rack</mark4><br>
As Earth and Skie would mingle; but my <mark3>self</mark3><br>
Was distant; and these flaws, though mortals fear <mark1>them</mark1><br>
As dangerous to the pillard frame of <mark1>Heaven,</mark1><br>
Or to the Earths dark basis <mark4>underneath,</mark4><br>
Are to the main as <mark5>inconsiderable,</mark5><br>
And harmless, if not wholsom, as a <mark4>sneeze</mark4><br>
To mans less universe, and soon are <mark4>gone;</mark4><br>
Yet as being oft times noxious where they <mark1>light</mark1><br>
On man, beast, <mark4>plant</mark4>, wastful and <mark4>turbulent,</mark4><br>
Like turbulencies in the affairs of <mark1>men,</mark1><br>
Over whose heads they rore, and seem to <mark4>point,</mark4><br>
They oft fore-signifie and threaten <mark4>ill:</mark4><br>
This Tempest at this Desert most was <mark4>bent;</mark4><br>
Of men at thee, for only thou here <mark4>dwell'st.</mark4><br>
Did I not tell thee, if thou didst <mark4>reject</mark4><br>
The perfet season offer'd with my <mark1>aid</mark1><br>
To win thy destin'd seat, but wilt <mark4>prolong</mark4><br>
All to the push of Fate, persue thy <mark1>way</mark1><br>
Of gaining David's Throne no man knows <mark3>when,</mark3><br>
For both the when and how is no where <mark4>told,</mark4><br>
Thou shalt be what thou art ordain'd, no <mark4>doubt;</mark4><br>
For Angels have proclaim'd it, but <mark4>concealing</mark4><br>
The time and means: each act is rightliest <mark1>done,</mark1><br>
Not when it <mark4>must</mark4>, but when it may be <mark1>best.</mark1><br>
If thou observe not this, be sure to <mark1>find,</mark1><br>
What I foretold thee, many a hard <mark4>assay</mark4><br>
Of <mark4>dangers</mark4>, and adversities and <mark4>pains,</mark4><br>
E're thou of Israel's Scepter get fast <mark4>hold;</mark4><br>
Whereof this ominous night that clos'd thee <mark1>round,</mark1><br>
So many terrors, <mark4>voices</mark4>, <mark4>prodigies</mark4><br>
May warn thee, as a sure fore-going <mark4>sign.</mark4><br>
So talk'd he, while the Son of God went <mark4>on</mark4><br>
And staid not, but in brief him answer'd <mark1>thus.</mark1><br>
Mee worse then wet thou find'st not; other <mark4>harm</mark4><br>
Those terrors which thou speak'st of, did me <mark1>none;</mark1><br>
I never fear'd they <mark4>could</mark4>, though noising <mark4>loud</mark4><br>
And threatning nigh; what they can do as <mark4>signs</mark4><br>
Betok'ning, or ill boding, I <mark5>contemn</mark5><br>
As false portents, not sent from God, but <mark1>thee;</mark1><br>
Who knowing I shall raign past thy <mark4>preventing,</mark4><br>
Obtrud'st thy offer'd aid, that I <mark4>accepting</mark4><br>
At least might seem to hold all power of <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
Ambitious spirit, and wouldst be thought my <mark1>God,</mark1><br>
And storm'st refus'd, thinking to terrifie <br>
Mee to thy will; desist, thou art <mark4>discern'd</mark4><br>
And toil'st in vain, nor me in vain <mark3>molest.</mark3><br>
To whom the Fiend now swoln with rage <mark1>reply'd:</mark1><br>
Then hear, O Son of David, <mark4>Virgin-born;</mark4><br>
For Son of God to me is yet in <mark1>doubt,</mark1><br>
Of the Messiah I have heard <mark1>foretold</mark1><br>
By all the Prophets; of thy birth at <mark4>length</mark4><br>
Announc't by Gabriel with the first I <mark1>knew,</mark1><br>
And of the Angelic Song in Bethlehem <mark4>field,</mark4><br>
On thy birth-night, that sung thee Saviour <mark3>born.</mark3><br>
From that time seldom have I ceas'd to <mark1>eye</mark1><br>
Thy infancy, thy childhood, and thy <mark4>youth,</mark4><br>
Thy manhood last, though yet in private <mark1>bred;</mark1><br>
Till at the Ford of Jordan whither <mark1>all</mark1><br>
Flock'd to the <mark4>Baptist</mark4>, I among the <mark1>rest,</mark1><br>
Though not to be Baptiz'd, by voice from <mark5>Heav'n</mark5><br>
Heard thee pronounc'd the Son of God <mark4>belov'd.</mark4><br>
Thenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer <mark1>view</mark1><br>
And narrower Scrutiny, that I might <mark4>learn</mark4><br>
In what degree or meaning thou art <mark1>call'd</mark1><br>
The Son of God, which bears no single <mark1>sence;</mark1><br>
The Son of God I also am, or <mark4>was,</mark4><br>
And if I was, I am; relation <mark1>stands;</mark1><br>
All men are Sons of God; yet thee I <mark1>thought</mark1><br>
In some respect far higher so <mark5>declar'd.</mark5><br>
Therefore I watch'd thy footsteps from that <mark4>hour,</mark4><br>
And follow'd thee still on to this wast <mark4>wild;</mark4><br>
Where by all best conjectures I <mark4>collect</mark4><br>
Thou art to be my fatal <mark4>enemy.</mark4><br>
Good reason then, if I before-hand <mark1>seek</mark1><br>
To understand my Adversary, <mark3>who</mark3><br>
And what he is; his wisdom, power, <mark4>intent,</mark4><br>
By parl, or composition, truce, or <mark5>league</mark5><br>
To win him, or win from him what I <mark1>can.</mark1><br>
And opportunity I here have <mark4>had</mark4><br>
To try <mark1>thee</mark1>, sift thee, and confess have found <mark1>thee</mark1><br>
Proof against all temptation as a <mark1>rock</mark1><br>
Of Adamant, and as a Center, <mark1>firm</mark1><br>
To the utmost of meer man both wise and <mark4>good,</mark4><br>
Not more; for Honours, Riches, Kingdoms, <mark1>Glory</mark1><br>
Have been before contemn'd, and may agen: <br>
Therefore to know what more thou art then <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
Worth naming Son of God by voice from <mark1>Heav'n,</mark1><br>
Another method I must now <mark4>begin.</mark4><br>
So saying he caught him up, and without <mark4>wing</mark4><br>
Of Hippogrif bore through the Air <mark4>sublime</mark4><br>
Over the Wilderness and o're the <mark4>Plain;</mark4><br>
Till underneath them fair <mark4>Jerusalem,</mark4><br>
The holy City lifted high her <mark4>Towers,</mark4><br>
And higher yet the glorious Temple <mark4>rear'd</mark4><br>
Her pile, far off appearing like a <mark1>Mount</mark1><br>
Of Alabaster, top't with Golden <mark1>Spires:</mark1><br>
There on the highest Pinacle he <mark1>set</mark1><br>
The Son of God; and added thus in <mark4>scorn:</mark4><br>
There stand, if thou wilt stand; to stand <mark4>upright</mark4><br>
Will ask thee skill; I to thy Fathers <mark1>house</mark1><br>
Have brought thee, and highest plac't, highest is <mark1>best,</mark1><br>
Now shew thy Progeny; if not to <mark4>stand,</mark4><br>
Cast thy self down; safely if Son of <mark1>God:</mark1><br>
For it is written, He will give <mark4>command</mark4><br>
Concerning thee to his <mark4>Angels</mark4>, in thir <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
They shall up lift thee, lest at any <mark1>time</mark1><br>
Thou chance to dash thy foot against a <mark1>stone.</mark1><br>
To whom thus Jesus: also it is <mark1>written,</mark1><br>
Tempt not the Lord thy <mark4>God</mark4>, he said and <mark1>stood.</mark1><br>
But Satan smitten with amazement <mark1>fell</mark1><br>
As when Earths Son Antaeus (to <mark1>compare</mark1><br>
Small things with greatest) in Irassa <mark4>strove</mark4><br>
With Joves Alcides, and oft foil'd still <mark1>rose,</mark1><br>
Receiving from his mother Earth new <mark4>strength,</mark4><br>
Fresh from his fall, and fiercer grapple <mark1>joyn'd,</mark1><br>
Throttl'd at length in the Air, expir'd and <mark1>fell;</mark1><br>
So after many a foil the Tempter <mark4>proud,</mark4><br>
Renewing fresh assaults, amidst his <mark1>pride</mark1><br>
Fell whence he stood to see his Victor <mark4>fall.</mark4><br>
And as that Theban Monster that <mark1>propos'd</mark1><br>
Her riddle, and him, who solv'd it not, <mark4>devour'd;</mark4><br>
That once found out and solv'd, for grief and <mark1>spight</mark1><br>
Cast her self headlong from th' Ismenian <mark4>steep,</mark4><br>
So strook with dread and anguish fell the <mark4>Fiend,</mark4><br>
And to his crew, that sat consulting, <mark1>brought</mark1><br>
Joyless triumphals of his hop't <mark1>success,</mark1><br>
Ruin, and desperation, and <mark3>dismay,</mark3><br>
Who durst so proudly tempt the Son of <mark1>God.</mark1><br>
So Satan fell and strait a fiery <mark5>Globe</mark5><br>
Of Angels on full sail of wing flew <mark3>nigh,</mark3><br>
Who on their plumy Vans receiv'd him <mark4>soft</mark4><br>
From his uneasie station, and upbore <br>
As on a floating couch through the blithe <mark3>Air,</mark3><br>
Then in a flowry valley set him <mark1>down</mark1><br>
On a green bank, and set before him <mark5>spred</mark5><br>
A table of Celestial Food, <mark4>Divine,</mark4><br>
Ambrosial, Fruits fetcht from the tree of <mark1>life,</mark1><br>
And from the fount of life Ambrosial <mark4>drink,</mark4><br>
That soon refresh'd him wearied, and <mark4>repair'd</mark4><br>
What hunger, if aught hunger had <mark3>impair'd,</mark3><br>
Or thirst, and as he fed, Angelic Quires <br>
Sung Heavenly Anthems of his <mark4>victory</mark4><br>
Over temptation, and the Tempter <mark1>proud.</mark1><br>
   True Image of the Father whether thron'd <br>
In the bosom of bliss, and light of <mark1>light</mark1><br>
Conceiving, or remote from Heaven, <mark5>enshrin'd</mark5><br>
In fleshly Tabernacle, and human <mark4>form,</mark4><br>
Wandring the <mark4>Wilderness</mark4>, whatever <mark4>place,</mark4><br>
Habit, or state, or motion, still <mark4>expressing</mark4><br>
The Son of God, with Godlike force <mark5>indu'd</mark5><br>
Against th' Attempter of thy Fathers <mark1>Throne,</mark1><br>
And Thief of Paradise; him long of <mark1>old</mark1><br>
Thou didst debel, and down from Heav'n <mark4>cast</mark4><br>
With all his Army, now thou hast aveng'd <br>
Supplanted Adam, and by <mark5>vanquishing</mark5><br>
Temptation, hast regain'd lost <mark4>Paradise,</mark4><br>
And frustrated the conquest <mark4>fraudulent:</mark4><br>
He never more henceforth will dare set <mark4>foot</mark4><br>
In Paradise to tempt; his snares are <mark1>broke:</mark1><br>
For though that seat of earthly bliss be <mark4>fail'd,</mark4><br>
A fairer Paradise is founded <mark1>now</mark1><br>
For Adam and his chosen Sons, whom <mark1>thou</mark1><br>
A Saviour art come down to <mark3>re-install.</mark3><br>
Where they shall dwell secure, when time shall <mark4>be</mark4><br>
Of Tempter and Temptation without <mark4>fear.</mark4><br>
But thou, Infernal Serpent, shalt not <mark1>long</mark1><br>
Rule in the Clouds; like an Autumnal <mark4>Star</mark4><br>
Or Lightning thou shalt fall from Heav'n trod <mark1>down</mark1><br>
Under his feet: for proof, e're this thou <mark4>feel'st</mark4><br>
Thy <mark1>wound</mark1>, yet not thy last and deadliest <mark4>wound</mark4><br>
By this repulse receiv'd, and hold'st in <mark4>Hell</mark4><br>
No triumph; in all her gates Abaddon <mark5>rues</mark5><br>
Thy bold attempt; hereafter learn with <mark3>awe</mark3><br>
To dread the Son of God: he all <mark4>unarm'd</mark4><br>
Shall chase thee with the terror of his <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
From thy Demoniac holds, possession <mark4>foul,</mark4><br>
Thee and thy Legions, yelling they shall <mark3>flye,</mark3><br>
And beg to hide them in a herd of <mark4>Swine,</mark4><br>
Lest he command them down into the <mark3>deep</mark3><br>
Bound, and to torment sent before thir <mark1>time.</mark1><br>
Hail Son of the most High, heir of both <mark4>worlds,</mark4><br>
Queller of Satan, on thy glorious <mark4>work</mark4><br>
Now enter, and begin to save <mark4>mankind.</mark4><br>
Thus they the Son of God our Saviour <mark4>meek</mark4><br>
Sung Victor, and from Heavenly Feast <mark5>refresht</mark5><br>
Brought on his way with joy; hee unobserv'd <br>
Home to his Mothers house private <mark4>return'd.</mark4><br>
