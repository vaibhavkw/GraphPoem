Title : Sonnet 30: When to the sessions of sweet silent thought <br>
Author : William Shakespeare <br><br>

When to the sessions of sweet silent <mark4>thought</mark4><br>
I summon up remembrance of things <mark4>past,</mark4><br>
I sigh the lack of many a thing I <mark4>sought,</mark4><br>
And with old woes new wail my dear time's <mark4>waste:</mark4><br>
Then can I drown an eye, unus'd to <mark3>flow,</mark3><br>
For precious friends hid in death's dateless <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd <mark3>woe,</mark3><br>
And moan th' expense of many a vanish'd <mark3>sight;</mark3><br>
Then can I grieve at grievances <mark4>foregone,</mark4><br>
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er <br>
The sad account of fore-bemoaned <mark4>moan,</mark4><br>
Which I new pay as if not paid before. <br>
But if the while I think on thee, dear <mark3>friend,</mark3><br>
All losses are restor'd, and sorrows <mark3>end.</mark3><br>
