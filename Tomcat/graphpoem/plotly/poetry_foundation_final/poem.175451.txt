Title : Native Woman <br>
Author : A. F. Moritz <br><br>

Her hair back from the wide round face <br>
flows, almost a girl's, so <mark4>thick,</mark4><br>
caught back in combs, <mark4>racing</mark4><br>
and curling through them with <mark4>blackest</mark4><br>
vigor, although it is pure <mark4>white.</mark4><br>
Cracked face, dusk-colored: not red <br>
but with a deep red struggling under <br>
the coming night. The eyes shift <mark4>quickly,</mark4><br>
the subway train jerks and <mark4>rattles,</mark4><br>
green vinyl, light flickering, silver <mark4>poles.</mark4><br>
Eyes driven from ancient calm, <br>
which may fear but is never <mark4>frantic</mark4><br>
and says nothing, such as looks <mark4>out</mark4><br>
from the old Indian portraits--calm <mark4>is</mark4><br>
the one thing missing from the <mark4>beauty</mark4><br>
of her face in the black window. <br>
Those unresting eyes there <br>
talk plainly: there's no <mark4>money</mark4><br>
at home, men young and old go <mark4>wrong,</mark4><br>
life almost at its end <mark1>is</mark1><br>
still day by day harried and <mark4>perplexed.</mark4><br>
