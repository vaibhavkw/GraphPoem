For I will consider my Cat Jeoffry.<br>
For he is the servant of the Living God duly and daily serving <mark5>him.</mark5><br>
For at the first glance of the glory of God in the East he worships in his way.<br>
For this is done by wreathing his body seven times round with elegant <mark4>quickness.</mark4><br>
For then he leaps up to catch the musk, which is the blessing of God upon his <mark3>prayer.</mark3><br>
For he rolls upon prank to work it <mark4>in.</mark4><br>
For having done duty and received blessing he begins to consider <mark5>himself.</mark5><br>
For this he performs in ten <mark4>degrees.</mark4><br>
For first he looks upon his forepaws to see if they are <mark4>clean.</mark4><br>
For secondly he kicks up behind to clear away <mark3>there.</mark3><br>
For thirdly he works it upon stretch with the forepaws <mark4>extended.</mark4><br>
For fourthly he sharpens his paws by <mark4>wood.</mark4><br>
For fifthly he washes <mark1>himself.</mark1><br>
For sixthly he rolls upon wash.<br>
For seventhly he fleas himself, that he may not be interrupted upon the <mark4>beat.</mark4><br>
For eighthly he rubs himself against a <mark4>post.</mark4><br>
For ninthly he looks up for his <mark4>instructions.</mark4><br>
For tenthly he goes in quest of <mark4>food.</mark4><br>
For having consider'd God and himself he will consider his <mark4>neighbour.</mark4><br>
For if he meets another cat he will kiss her in <mark4>kindness.</mark4><br>
For when he takes his prey he plays with it to give it a <mark4>chance.</mark4><br>
For one mouse in seven escapes by his dallying.<br>
For when his day's work is done his business more properly <mark4>begins.</mark4><br>
For he keeps the Lord's watch in the night against the <mark4>adversary.</mark4><br>
For he counteracts the powers of darkness by his electrical skin and glaring <mark4>eyes.</mark4><br>
For he counteracts the Devil, who is death, by brisking about the <mark4>life.</mark4><br>
For in his morning orisons he loves the sun and the sun loves <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
For he is of the tribe of <mark4>Tiger.</mark4><br>
For the Cherub Cat is a term of the Angel <mark1>Tiger.</mark1><br>
For he has the subtlety and hissing of a serpent, which in goodness he <mark4>suppresses.</mark4><br>
For he will not do destruction, if he is well-fed, neither will he spit without <mark4>provocation.</mark4><br>
For he purrs in thankfulness, when God tells him he's a good <mark4>Cat.</mark4><br>
For he is an instrument for the children to learn benevolence <mark4>upon.</mark4><br>
For every house is incomplete without him and a blessing is lacking in the <mark4>spirit.</mark4><br>
For the Lord commanded Moses concerning the cats at the departure of the Children of Israel from <mark4>Egypt.</mark4><br>
For every family had one cat at least in the bag.<br>
For the English Cats are the best in <mark4>Europe.</mark4><br>
For he is the cleanest in the use of his forepaws of any <mark1>quadruped.</mark1><br>
For the dexterity of his defence is an instance of the love of God to him <mark4>exceedingly.</mark4><br>
For he is the quickest to his mark of any <mark4>creature.</mark4><br>
For he is tenacious of his <mark4>point.</mark4><br>
For he is a mixture of gravity and waggery.<br>
For he knows that God is his Saviour.<br>
For there is nothing sweeter than his peace when at <mark4>rest.</mark4><br>
For there is nothing brisker than his life when in <mark4>motion.</mark4><br>
For he is of the Lord's poor and so indeed is he called by benevolence perpetually--Poor Jeoffry! poor Jeoffry! the rat has bit thy <mark4>throat.</mark4><br>
For I bless the name of the Lord Jesus that Jeoffry is <mark4>better.</mark4><br>
For the divine spirit comes about his body to sustain it in complete <mark1>cat.</mark1><br>
For his tongue is exceeding pure so that it has in purity what it wants in <mark1>music.</mark1><br>
For he is docile and can learn certain <mark4>things.</mark4><br>
For he can set up with gravity which is patience upon <mark4>approbation.</mark4><br>
For he can fetch and carry, which is patience in <mark4>employment.</mark4><br>
For he can jump over a stick which is patience upon proof <mark5>positive.</mark5><br>
For he can spraggle upon waggle at the word of <mark4>command.</mark4><br>
For he can jump from an eminence into his master's <mark4>bosom.</mark4><br>
For he can catch the cork and toss it <mark4>again.</mark4><br>
For he is hated by the hypocrite and <mark4>miser.</mark4><br>
For the former is afraid of <mark4>detection.</mark4><br>
For the latter refuses the <mark5>charge.</mark5><br>
For he camels his back to bear the first notion of <mark4>business.</mark4><br>
For he is good to think on, if a man would express himself <mark4>neatly.</mark4><br>
For he made a great figure in Egypt for his signal <mark4>services.</mark4><br>
For he killed the Ichneumon-rat very pernicious by <mark3>land.</mark3><br>
For his ears are so acute that they sting <mark1>again.</mark1><br>
For from this proceeds the passing quickness of his <mark4>attention.</mark4><br>
For by stroking of him I have found out <mark4>electricity.</mark4><br>
For I perceived God's light about him both wax and <mark4>fire.</mark4><br>
For the Electrical fire is the spiritual substance, which God sends from heaven to sustain the bodies both of man and <mark4>beast.</mark4><br>
For God has blessed him in the variety of his <mark4>movements.</mark4><br>
For, tho he cannot fly, he is an excellent clamberer.<br>
For his motions upon the face of the earth are more than any other <mark1>quadruped.</mark1><br>
For he can tread to all the measures upon the <mark1>music.</mark1><br>
For he can swim for <mark1>life.</mark1><br>
For he can <mark4>creep.</mark4><br>
