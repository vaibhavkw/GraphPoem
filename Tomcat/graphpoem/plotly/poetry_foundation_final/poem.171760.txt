Title : Maple Syrup <br>
Author : Donald Hall <br><br>

August, goldenrod blowing. We <mark1>walk</mark1><br>
into the <mark4>graveyard</mark4>, to <mark4>find</mark4><br>
my grandfather's grave. Ten years <mark1>ago</mark1><br>
I came here last, <mark4>bringing</mark4><br>
marigolds from the round <mark4>garden</mark4><br>
outside the <mark4>kitchen.</mark4><br>
I didn't know you <mark4>then.</mark4><br>
We <mark1>walk</mark1><br>
among carved names that go with <mark4>photographs</mark4><br>
on top of the piano at the <mark4>farm:</mark4><br>
Keneston, Wells, Fowler, Batchelder, <mark4>Buck.</mark4><br>
We pause at the new <mark5>grave</mark5><br>
of Grace Fenton, my <mark5>grandfather's</mark5><br>
<mark4>sister</mark4>, Last <mark4>summer</mark4><br>
we called on her at the nursing <mark4>home,</mark4><br>
eighty-seven, and <mark4>nodding</mark4><br>
in a blue housedress. We cannot <mark1>find</mark1><br>
my grandfather's <mark1>grave.</mark1><br>
Back at the <mark4>house</mark4><br>
where no one lives, we <mark4>potter</mark4><br>
and explore the back <mark4>chamber</mark4><br>
where everything comes to rest: spinning <mark4>wheels,</mark4><br>
pretty boxes, <mark4>quilts,</mark4><br>
bottles, books, albums of <mark4>postcards.</mark4><br>
Then with a flashlight we <mark4>descend</mark4><br>
firm steps to the root cellar--black,   <br>
cobwebby, huge, <br>
with dirt floors and fieldstone <mark4>walls,</mark4><br>
and above the walls, holding the <mark4>hewn</mark4><br>
sills of the <mark4>house</mark4>, <mark4>enormous</mark4><br>
granite foundation <mark4>stones.</mark4><br>
Past the empty <mark4>bins</mark4><br>
for squash, apples, carrots, and <mark4>potatoes,</mark4><br>
we discover the shelves for canning, a few <br>
pale <mark4>pints</mark4><br>
of tomato left, and--what <br>
is this?--syrup, maple <mark1>syrup</mark1><br>
in a quart jar, <mark1>syrup</mark1><br>
my grandfather made <mark4>twenty-five</mark4><br>
years <mark1>ago</mark1><br>
for the last <mark4>time.</mark4><br>
I <mark4>remember</mark4><br>
coming to the farm in March <br>
in sugaring time, as a small boy. <br>
He carried the pails of sap, <mark4>sixteen-quart</mark4><br>
buckets, dangling from each <mark3>end</mark3><br>
of a wooden <mark4>yoke</mark4><br>
that lay across his shoulders, and emptied <mark4>them</mark4><br>
into a vat in the <mark1>saphouse</mark1><br>
where fire burned day and <mark4>night</mark4><br>
for a <mark4>week.</mark4><br>
Now the <mark1>saphouse</mark1><br>
tilts, nearly to the <mark4>ground,</mark4><br>
like someone <mark4>exhausted</mark4><br>
to the point of death, and next <mark4>winter</mark4><br>
when snow piles three feet <mark4>thick</mark4><br>
on the roofs of the cold <mark1>farm,</mark1><br>
the saphouse will shudder and <mark4>slide</mark4><br>
with the snow to the <mark1>ground.</mark1><br>
<br>
we take my grandfather's <mark4>last</mark4><br>
quart of <mark1>syrup</mark1><br>
upstairs, holding it gingerly, <br>
and we wash off twenty-five <mark4>years</mark4><br>
of dirt, and we pull <br>
and pry the lid up, cutting the stiff,   <br>
dried rubber gasket, and dip our <mark4>fingers</mark4><br>
in, you and I both, and <mark4>taste</mark4><br>
the sweetness, you for the first <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
the sweetness preserved, of a dead <mark4>man</mark4><br>
in the kitchen he <mark4>left</mark4><br>
when his body <mark4>slid</mark4><br>
like anyone's into the <mark1>ground.</mark1><br>
