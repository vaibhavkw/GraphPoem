Title : Bed in Summer <br>
Author : Robert Louis Stevenson <br><br>

In winter I get up at <mark4>night</mark4><br>
And dress by yellow <mark4>candle-light.</mark4><br>
In summer, quite the other <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
I have to go to bed by <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
<br>
I have to go to bed and <mark3>see</mark3><br>
The birds still hopping on the <mark3>tree,</mark3><br>
Or hear the grown-up people's <mark4>feet</mark4><br>
Still going past me in the <mark3>street.</mark3><br>
<br>
And does it not seem hard to <mark3>you,</mark3><br>
When all the sky is clear and <mark3>blue,</mark3><br>
And I should like so much to <mark3>play,</mark3><br>
To have to go to bed by <mark1>day?</mark1><br>
