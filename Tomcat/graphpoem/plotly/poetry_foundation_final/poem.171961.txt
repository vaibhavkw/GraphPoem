Title : For Louis Pasteur <br>
Author : Edgar Bowers <br><br>

"Who is Apollo?" College <mark4>student</mark4><br>
How shall a generation know its <mark4>story</mark4><br>
If it will know no other? When, <mark4>among</mark4><br>
The scoffers at the Institute, <mark4>Pasteur</mark4><br>
Heard one deny the cause of child-birth <mark4>fever,</mark4><br>
Indignantly he drew upon the <mark4>blackboard,</mark4><br>
For all to see, the Streptococcus <mark3>chain.</mark3><br>
His mind was like Odysseus and Plato   <br>
Exploring a new cosmos in the <mark4>old</mark4><br>
As if he wrote a poem--his <mark4>enemy</mark4><br>
Suffering, disease, and death, the <mark4>battleground</mark4><br>
His introspection. "Science and peace," he <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
"Will win out over ignorance and <mark4>war,"</mark4><br>
But <mark4>then</mark4>, the virus mutant in his <mark3>vein,</mark3><br>
"Death to the Prussian!" and <mark2>"revenge</mark2>, <mark2>revenge!"</mark2><br>
<br>
How shall my generation tell its <mark1>story?</mark1><br>
Their fathers jobless, boys for the CCC <br>
And NYA, the future like a <mark4>stairwell</mark4><br>
To floors without a window or a <mark3>door,</mark3><br>
And then the army: bayonet drill and <mark4>foxhole;</mark4><br>
Bombing to rubble cities with textbook <mark4>names</mark4><br>
Later to bulldoze streets for; their green <mark4>bodies</mark4><br>
Drowned in the greener surfs of rumored <mark4>France.</mark4><br>
My childhood friend, George Humphreys, whom I still <mark3>see</mark3><br>
Still ten years old, his uncombed hair and <mark4>grin</mark4><br>
Moment by moment in the Hurtgen dark   <br>
Until the one step full in the sniper's <mark4>sight,</mark4><br>
His pastor father emptied by the <mark5>grief.</mark5><br>
Clark Harrison, at nineteen a <mark4>survivor,</mark4><br>
Never to walk or have a child or <mark3>be</mark3><br>
A senator or <mark4>governor</mark4>, Herr <mark4>Wegner,</mark4><br>
Who led his little troop, their standards <mark3>high</mark3><br>
And sabers drawn, against a panzer <mark4>corps,</mark4><br>
Emerging from among the shades at Dachau <br>
Stacked like firewood for someone else to <mark4>burn;</mark4><br>
And Gerd Radomski, listening to <mark4>broadcasts</mark4><br>
Of names, a yearlong babel of the <mark4>missing,</mark4><br>
To find his wife and children. Then they came <mark4>home,</mark4><br>
Near middle age at twenty-two, to <mark4>find</mark4><br>
A new reunion of the church and <mark4>state,</mark4><br>
Cynical Constantines who need no <mark4>name,</mark4><br>
Domestic tranquility beaten to a <mark4>sword,</mark4><br>
Sons wasted by another lie in Asia,   <br>
Or Strangeloves they had feared that August day;   <br>
And they like runners, stung, behind a flag,   <br>
Running within a circle, bereft of joy. <br>
<br>
Hearing of the disaster at <mark4>Sedan</mark4><br>
And the retreat worse than the one from Moscow,   <br>
Their son among the missing or the <mark4>dead,</mark4><br>
Pasteur and his wife Mary hired a <mark4>carriage</mark4><br>
And, traveling to the east where he might <mark3>try</mark3><br>
His way to Paris, stopping to ask each youth   <br>
And comfort every orphan of the <mark4>state's</mark4><br>
Irascibility, found him at <mark4>last</mark4><br>
And, unsurprised, embraced and took him <mark4>in.</mark4><br>
Two wars later, the <mark4>Prussian</mark4>, once <mark4>again</mark4><br>
The son of Mars, in Paris, Joseph <mark4>Meister--</mark4><br>
The first boy cured of rabies, now the <mark4>keeper</mark4><br>
Of Pasteur's mausoleum--when <mark4>commanded</mark4><br>
To open it for them, though over <mark4>seventy,</mark4><br>
Lest he betray the master, took his <mark4>life.</mark4><br>
<br>
I like to think of Pasteur in <mark4>Elysium</mark4><br>
Beneath the sunny pine of ripe <mark4>Provence</mark4><br>
Tenderly raising black sheep, <mark4>butterflies,</mark4><br>
Silkworms, and a new culture, for <mark4>delight,</mark4><br>
Teaching his daughter to use a microscope <br>
And musing through a wonder--sacred <mark4>passion,</mark4><br>
Practice and metaphysic all the <mark4>same.</mark4><br>
And, each year, honor three births: <mark4>Valery,</mark4><br>
Humbling his pride by trying to write <mark4>well,</mark4><br>
Mozart, who lives still, keeping my <mark4>attention</mark4><br>
Repeatedly outside the reach of <mark4>pride,</mark4><br>
And him whose mark I witness as a <mark4>trust.</mark4><br>
Others he saves but could not save <mark4>himself--</mark4><br>
Socrates, Galen, Hippocrates--the <mark4>spirit</mark4><br>
Fastened by love upon the human <mark4>cross.</mark4><br>
