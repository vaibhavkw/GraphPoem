Title : A Daughter of Eve <br>
Author : Christina Rossetti <br><br>

A fool I was to sleep at <mark3>noon,</mark3><br>
And wake when night is <mark3>chilly</mark3><br>
Beneath the comfortless cold <mark3>moon;</mark3><br>
A fool to pluck my rose too <mark3>soon,</mark3><br>
A fool to snap my <mark3>lily.</mark3><br>
<br>
My garden-plot I have not <mark3>kept;</mark3><br>
Faded and <mark4>all-forsaken,</mark4><br>
I weep as I have never <mark3>wept:</mark3><br>
Oh it was summer when I <mark3>slept,</mark3><br>
It's winter now I <mark3>waken.</mark3><br>
<br>
Talk what you please of future <mark4>spring</mark4><br>
         And sun-warm'd sweet to-morrow:?<br>
Stripp'd bare of hope and <mark4>everything,</mark4><br>
No more to laugh, no more to <mark4>sing,</mark4><br>
         I sit alone with sorrow.<br>
