Title : Carrie Leigh's Hugh Hefner Haikus <br>
Author : Lynn Crosbie <br><br>

Hef brings me <mark4>flowers</mark4><br>
tiger lilies, ochre veined <br>
downcast, sleek black <mark4>cups</mark4><br>
<br>
small shadows, are <mark1>the</mark1><br>
puckers in his <mark1>pyjamas</mark1><br>
where his skin caves <mark4>in</mark4><br>
<br>
tired profligate, I <br>
sigh and pour the oil along <br>
your circular <mark4>sheets</mark4><br>
<br>
thinking of all <mark1>the</mark1><br>
times, or women on this <mark4>bed</mark4><br>
glossy old <mark4>bunnies</mark4><br>
<br>
I imagine <mark5>their</mark5><br>
breasts, plate of fried eggs, a row <br>
of tonsured monks' <mark4>heads</mark4><br>
<br>
his tongue slithers, <mark4>gaunt</mark4><br>
voluptuary, <mark4>ugly</mark4><br>
old man, my eyes <mark4>close</mark4><br>
<br>
when I roll his name <br>
Ner. along my tongue, like <mark1>the</mark1><br>
line of cold test <mark4>tubes</mark4><br>
<br>
thin bottled <mark4>semen,</mark4><br>
he wants to plant it, <mark4>deeply</mark4><br>
in my flat <mark4>belly</mark4><br>
<br>
Hugh junior, and, <mark4>or</mark4><br>
Carietta, a child <mark4>is</mark4><br>
packed in dry blue <mark4>ice</mark4><br>
<br>
in silk <mark1>pyjamas</mark1><br>
they have an emperor's <mark4>crest</mark4><br>
it is dark in <mark4>there</mark4><br>
<br>
but it's cold <mark4>as</mark4><br>
the green jacuzzi, <mark4>bubbles</mark4><br>
are clouds on its <mark4>face</mark4><br>
<br>
I will crush the <mark4>glass</mark4><br>
with the fingers in his back <br>
and pile on my <mark4>rings</mark4><br>
<br>
and all the fur <mark4>coats</mark4><br>
and move down the <mark3>circular</mark3><br>
stairs, bloated with <mark4>gold</mark4><br>
<br>
the flowers are <mark3>a</mark3><br>
venus-flytrap, with red <mark4>curls</mark4><br>
flames and noxious breath <br>
<br>
his betrayal <mark4>gives</mark4><br>
me granite fists, girls <mark4>scatter</mark4><br>
movie stars <mark4>crumple</mark4><br>
<br>
as I run <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
from the gaudy prison <mark4>cell,</mark4><br>
of tinsel and <mark4>skin</mark4><br>
<br>
I'll sue him and <mark4>write</mark4><br>
and build a home, in <mark1>the</mark1><br>
desert, on the <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
<br>
a sequined <mark4>empress,</mark4><br>
a mirage--in loungewear <mark4>and</mark4><br>
harlequin <mark4>glasses</mark4><br>
