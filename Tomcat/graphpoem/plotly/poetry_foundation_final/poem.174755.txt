Title : In School-days <br>
Author : John Greenleaf Whittier <br><br>

Still sits the school-house by the <mark4>road,</mark4><br>
A ragged beggar <mark3>sleeping;</mark3><br>
Around it still the sumachs <mark3>grow,</mark3><br>
And blackberry-vines are <mark3>creeping.</mark3><br>
<br>
<mark4>Within</mark4>, the master's desk is <mark4>seen,</mark4><br>
Deep scarred by raps <mark3>official;</mark3><br>
The warping floor, the battered <mark4>seats,</mark4><br>
The jack-knife's carved <mark3>initial;</mark3><br>
<br>
The charcoal frescos on its <mark4>wall;</mark4><br>
Its door's worn sill, <mark4>betraying</mark4><br>
The feet that, creeping slow to <mark4>school,</mark4><br>
Went storming out to <mark3>playing!</mark3><br>
<br>
Long years ago a winter <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
Shone over it at <mark4>setting;</mark4><br>
Lit up its western <mark4>window-panes,</mark4><br>
And low eaves' icy <mark3>fretting.</mark3><br>
<br>
It touched the tangled golden <mark4>curls,</mark4><br>
And brown eyes full of <mark4>grieving,</mark4><br>
Of one who still her steps <mark4>delayed</mark4><br>
When all the school were <mark3>leaving.</mark3><br>
<br>
For near her stood the little boy <br>
Her childish favor <mark4>singled:</mark4><br>
His cap pulled low upon a <mark4>face</mark4><br>
Where pride and shame were <mark3>mingled.</mark3><br>
<br>
Pushing with restless feet the <mark3>snow</mark3><br>
To right and left, he <mark4>lingered;--</mark4><br>
As restlessly her tiny <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
The blue-checked apron <mark3>fingered.</mark3><br>
<br>
He saw her lift her eyes; he <mark5>felt</mark5><br>
The soft hand's light <mark4>caressing,</mark4><br>
And heard the tremble of her <mark4>voice,</mark4><br>
As if a fault <mark3>confessing.</mark3><br>
<br>
"I'm sorry that I spelt the <mark4>word:</mark4><br>
I hate to go above <mark1>you,</mark1><br>
Because,"--the brown eyes lower <mark4>fell,--</mark4><br>
"Because, you see, I love <mark1>you!"</mark1><br>
<br>
Still memory to a gray-haired <mark4>man</mark4><br>
That sweet child-face is <mark4>showing.</mark4><br>
Dear girl! the grasses on her grave <br>
Have forty years been <mark3>growing!</mark3><br>
<br>
He lives to learn, in life's hard <mark1>school,</mark1><br>
How few who pass above <mark1>him</mark1><br>
Lament their triumph and his <mark4>loss,</mark4><br>
Like her,--because they love <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
