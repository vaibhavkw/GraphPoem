Title : Ben Jonson Entertains a Man from Stratford <br>
Author : Edwin Arlington Robinson <br><br>

You are a friend then, as I make it <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
Of our man Shakespeare, who alone of <mark4>us</mark4><br>
Will put an ass's head in <mark4>Fairyland</mark4><br>
As he would add a shilling to more <mark4>shillings,</mark4><br>
All most harmonious, -- and out of <mark4>his</mark4><br>
Miraculous inviolable <mark4>increase</mark4><br>
Fills Ilion, Rome, or any town you <mark4>like</mark4><br>
Of olden time with timeless <mark4>Englishmen;</mark4><br>
And I must wonder what you think of him <mark1>--</mark1><br>
All you down there where your small Avon <mark4>flows</mark4><br>
By Stratford, and where you're an <mark4>Alderman.</mark4><br>
Some, for a guess, would have him riding <mark4>back</mark4><br>
To be a farrier there, or say a <mark4>dyer;</mark4><br>
Or maybe one of your adept <mark4>surveyors;</mark4><br>
Or like enough the wizard of all tanners. <br>
Not you -- no fear of that; for I <mark4>discern</mark4><br>
In you a kindling of the flame that saves <mark4>--</mark4><br>
The nimble element, the true <mark4>caloric;</mark4><br>
I see it, and was told of it, <mark4>moreover,</mark4><br>
By our discriminate friend himself, no <mark4>other.</mark4><br>
Had you been one of the sad average, <br>
As he would have it, -- meaning, as I take <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
The sinew and the solvent of our <mark4>Island,</mark4><br>
You'd not be buying beer for this Terpander's <br>
Approved and estimated friend Ben <mark4>Jonson;</mark4><br>
He'd never foist it as a part of <mark1>his</mark1><br>
Contingent entertainment of a <mark4>townsman</mark4><br>
While he goes off rehearsing, as he <mark4>must,</mark4><br>
If he shall ever be the Duke of <mark4>Stratford.</mark4><br>
And my words are no shadow on your town <mark4>--</mark4><br>
Far from it; for one town's as like <mark3>another</mark3><br>
As all are unlike London. Oh, he knows it, <mark1>--</mark1><br>
And there's the Stratford in him; he denies <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
And there's the Shakespeare in him. So, God help <mark1>him!</mark1><br>
I tell him he needs Greek; but neither <mark4>God</mark4><br>
Nor Greek will help him. Nothing will help that <mark4>man.</mark4><br>
You see the fates have given him so much, <br>
He must have all or perish, -- or look <mark1>out</mark1><br>
Of London, where he sees too many <mark4>lords.</mark4><br>
They're part of half what ails him: I <mark4>suppose</mark4><br>
There's nothing fouler down among the <mark4>demons</mark4><br>
Than what it is he feels when he <mark4>remembers</mark4><br>
The dust and sweat and ointment of his <mark5>calling</mark5><br>
With his lords looking on and laughing at <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
King as he is, he can't be king de <mark4>facto,</mark4><br>
And that's as well, because he wouldn't like <mark1>it;</mark1><br>
He'd frame a lower rating of men <mark4>then</mark4><br>
Than he has now; and after that would <mark4>come</mark4><br>
An abdication or an <mark4>apoplexy.</mark4><br>
He can't be king, not even king of Stratford, <mark1>--</mark1><br>
Though half the world, if not the whole of <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
May crown him with a crown that fits no <mark4>king</mark4><br>
Save Lord Apollo's homesick <mark4>emissary:</mark4><br>
Not there on Avon, or on any <mark4>stream</mark4><br>
Where Naiads and their white arms are no <mark5>more,</mark5><br>
Shall he find home again. It's all too <mark4>bad.</mark4><br>
But there's a comfort, for he'll have that House <mark4>--</mark4><br>
The best you ever saw; and he'll be <mark4>there</mark4><br>
Anon, as you're an Alderman. Good <mark1>God!</mark1><br>
He makes me lie awake o'nights and <mark4>laugh.</mark4><br>
<br>
And you have known him from his <mark4>origin,</mark4><br>
You tell me; and a most uncommon <mark4>urchin</mark4><br>
He must have been to the few seeing ones <mark4>--</mark4><br>
A trifle terrifying, I dare <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
Discovering a world with his man's <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
Quite as another lad might see some <mark4>finches,</mark4><br>
If he looked hard and had an eye for <mark4>nature.</mark4><br>
But this one had his eyes and their <mark4>foretelling,</mark4><br>
And he had you to fare with, and what <mark4>else?</mark4><br>
He must have had a father and a mother <mark4>--</mark4><br>
In fact I've heard him say so -- and a <mark1>dog,</mark1><br>
As a boy should, I venture; and the <mark1>dog,</mark1><br>
Most likely, was the only man who knew <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
A dog, for all I know, is what he <mark4>needs</mark4><br>
As much as anything right here <mark3>to-day,</mark3><br>
To counsel him about his <mark5>disillusions,</mark5><br>
Old aches, and parturitions of what's coming, <mark4>--</mark4><br>
A dog of orders, an <mark4>emeritus,</mark4><br>
To wag his tail at him when he comes <mark4>home,</mark4><br>
And then to put his paws up on his <mark4>knees</mark4><br>
And say, "For God's sake, what's it all <mark4>about?"</mark4><br>
<br>
I don't know whether he needs a dog or not <mark4>--</mark4><br>
Or what he needs. I tell him he needs <mark4>Greek;</mark4><br>
I'll talk of rules and Aristotle with <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
And if his tongue's at home he'll say to <mark4>that,</mark4><br>
I have your word that Aristotle <mark4>knows,</mark4><br>
And you mine that I don't know <mark4>Aristotle."</mark4><br>
He's all at odds with all the unities, <br>
And what's yet worse, it doesn't seem to <mark4>matter;</mark4><br>
He treads along through Time's old <mark4>wilderness</mark4><br>
As if the tramp of all the <mark4>centuries</mark4><br>
Had left no roads -- and there are none, for <mark1>him;</mark1><br>
He doesn't see them, even with those eyes, <mark1>--</mark1><br>
And that's a pity, or I say it <mark4>is.</mark4><br>
Accordingly we have him as we have him <mark1>--</mark1><br>
Going his way, the way that he goes <mark4>best,</mark4><br>
A pleasant animal with no great <mark4>noise</mark4><br>
Or nonsense anywhere to set him off <mark4>--</mark4><br>
Save only divers and inclement <mark4>devils</mark4><br>
Have made of late his heart their dwelling <mark4>place.</mark4><br>
A flame half ready to fly out <mark4>sometimes</mark4><br>
At some annoyance may be fanned up in <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
But soon it falls, and when it falls goes <mark1>out;</mark1><br>
He knows how little room there is in <mark1>there</mark1><br>
For crude and futile <mark4>animosities,</mark4><br>
And how much for the joy of being <mark4>whole,</mark4><br>
And how much for long sorrow and old <mark4>pain.</mark4><br>
On our side there are some who may be <mark4>given</mark4><br>
To grow old wondering what he thinks of <mark1>us</mark1><br>
And some above us, who are, in his <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
Above himself, -- and that's quite right and <mark5>English.</mark5><br>
Yet here we smile, or disappoint the <mark4>gods</mark4><br>
Who made it so: the gods have always <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
To see men scratch; and they see one down <mark4>here</mark4><br>
Who itches, manor-bitten to the <mark4>bone,</mark4><br>
Albeit he knows himself -- yes, yes, he knows <mark1>--</mark1><br>
The lord of more than England and of <mark1>more</mark1><br>
Than all the seas of England in all <mark4>time</mark4><br>
Shall ever wash. D'ye wonder that I <mark1>laugh?</mark1><br>
He sees me, and he doesn't seem to <mark4>care;</mark4><br>
And why the devil should he? I can't tell <mark3>you.</mark3><br>
<br>
I'll meet him out alone of a bright Sunday, <br>
Trim, rather spruce, and quite the <mark4>gentleman.</mark4><br>
"What ho, my lord!" say I. He doesn't hear <mark3>me;</mark3><br>
Wherefore I have to pause and look at <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
He's not enormous, but one looks at <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
A little on the round if you <mark4>insist,</mark4><br>
For now, God save the mark, he's growing <mark4>old;</mark4><br>
He's five and forty, and to hear him <mark4>talk</mark4><br>
These days you'd call him eighty; then you'd <mark4>add</mark4><br>
More years to that. He's old enough to <mark3>be</mark3><br>
The father of a world, and so he <mark1>is.</mark1><br>
"Ben, you're a scholar, what's the time of <mark3>day?"</mark3><br>
Says he; and there shines out of him <mark4>again</mark4><br>
An aged light that has no age or station <mark4>--</mark4><br>
The mystery that's his -- a <mark4>mischievous</mark4><br>
Half-mad serenity that laughs at <mark4>fame</mark4><br>
For being won so easy, and at <mark4>friends</mark4><br>
Who laugh at him for what he wants the <mark4>most,</mark4><br>
And for his dukedom down in Warwickshire; -- <br>
By which you see we're all a little jealous <mark4>...</mark4><br>
Poor Greene! I fear the color of his <mark3>name</mark3><br>
Was even as that of his ascending <mark3>soul;</mark3><br>
And he was one where there are many others, <mark4>--</mark4><br>
Some scrivening to the end against their <mark4>fate,</mark4><br>
Their puppets all in ink and all to die <mark1>there;</mark1><br>
And some with hands that once would shade an <mark5>eye</mark5><br>
That scanned Euripides and AEschylus <br>
Will reach by this time for a pot-house <mark4>mop</mark4><br>
To slush their first and last of <mark4>royalties.</mark4><br>
Poor devils! and they all play to his <mark4>hand;</mark4><br>
For so it was in Athens and old <mark4>Rome.</mark4><br>
But that's not here or there; I've wandered <mark1>off.</mark1><br>
Greene does it, or I'm careful. Where's that <mark5>boy?</mark5><br>
<br>
Yes, he'll go back to Stratford. And we'll miss <mark1>him?</mark1><br>
Dear sir, there'll be no London here without <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
We'll all be riding, one of these fine <mark4>days,</mark4><br>
Down there to see him -- and his wife won't like <mark1>us;</mark1><br>
And then we'll think of what he never <mark4>said</mark4><br>
Of women -- which, if taken all in <mark4>all</mark4><br>
With what he did say, would buy many <mark4>horses.</mark4><br>
Though nowadays he's not so much for <mark4>women:</mark4><br>
"So few of them," he says, "are worth the <mark4>guessing."</mark4><br>
But there's a worm at work when he says <mark1>that,</mark1><br>
And while he says it one feels in the <mark3>air</mark3><br>
A deal of circumambient <mark4>hocus-pocus.</mark4><br>
They've had him dancing till his toes were <mark4>tender,</mark4><br>
And he can feel 'em now, come chilly <mark4>rains.</mark4><br>
There's no long cry for going into <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
However, and we don't know much about <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
But you in Stratford, like most here in <mark4>London,</mark4><br>
Have more now in the Sonnets than you paid <mark4>for;</mark4><br>
He's put one there with all her poison <mark4>on,</mark4><br>
To make a singing fiction of a <mark5>shadow</mark5><br>
That's in his life a fact, and always will <mark1>be.</mark1><br>
But she's no care of ours, though Time, I <mark4>fear,</mark4><br>
Will have a more reverberant <mark3>ado</mark3><br>
About her than about another <mark4>one</mark4><br>
Who seems to have decoyed <mark1>him</mark1>, married <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
And sent him scuttling on his way to London, <mark1>--</mark1><br>
With much already learned, and more to <mark4>learn,</mark4><br>
And more to follow. Lord! how I see him <mark1>now,</mark1><br>
Pretending, maybe trying, to be like <mark1>us.</mark1><br>
Whatever he may have meant, we never had <mark1>him;</mark1><br>
He failed us, or escaped, or what you will, <mark4>--</mark4><br>
And there was that about him (God knows what, <mark4>--</mark4><br>
We'd flayed another had he tried it on <mark1>us)</mark1><br>
That made as many of us as had <mark4>wits</mark4><br>
More fond of all his easy <mark4>distances</mark4><br>
Than one another's noise and <mark4>clap-your-shoulder.</mark4><br>
But think you not, my friend, he'd never <mark1>talk!</mark1><br>
Talk? He was eldritch at it; and we listened <mark4>--</mark4><br>
Thereby acquiring much we knew <mark3>before</mark3><br>
About ourselves, and hitherto had <mark4>held</mark4><br>
Irrelevant, or not prime to the <mark4>purpose.</mark4><br>
And there were some, of course, and there be <mark1>now,</mark1><br>
Disordered and reduced amazedly <br>
To resignation by the mystic <mark4>seal</mark4><br>
Of young finality the gods had <mark4>laid</mark4><br>
On everything that made him a young <mark4>demon;</mark4><br>
And one or two shot looks at him <mark4>already</mark4><br>
As he had been their <mark4>executioner;</mark4><br>
And once or twice he was, not knowing it, <mark1>--</mark1><br>
Or knowing, being sorry for poor <mark3>clay</mark3><br>
And saying nothing ... Yet, for all his <mark4>engines,</mark4><br>
You'll meet a thousand of an <mark4>afternoon</mark4><br>
Who strut and sun themselves and see around <mark4>'em</mark4><br>
A world made out of more that has a <mark4>reason</mark4><br>
Than his, I swear, that he sees here <mark1>to-day;</mark1><br>
Though he may scarcely give a Fool an <mark3>exit</mark3><br>
But we mark how he sees in <mark4>everything</mark4><br>
A law that, given we flout it once too <mark4>often,</mark4><br>
Brings fire and iron down on our naked <mark4>heads.</mark4><br>
To me it looks as if the power that made <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
For fear of giving all things to one <mark4>creature,</mark4><br>
Left out the first, -- faith, innocence, <mark4>illusion,</mark4><br>
Whatever 'tis that keeps us out o' Bedlam, <mark4>--</mark4><br>
And thereby, for his too consuming <mark4>vision,</mark4><br>
Empowered him out of nature; though to see <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
You'd never guess what's going on inside <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
He'll break out some day like a keg of <mark4>ale</mark4><br>
With too much independent frenzy in <mark1>it;</mark1><br>
And all for collaring what he knows won't <mark4>keep,</mark4><br>
And what he'd best forget -- but that he <mark4>can't.</mark4><br>
You'll have it, and have more than I'm <mark1>foretelling;</mark1><br>
And there'll be such a roaring at the Globe <br>
As never stunned the bleeding <mark4>gladiators.</mark4><br>
He'll have to change the color of its <mark4>hair</mark4><br>
A bit, for now he calls it <mark1>Cleopatra.</mark1><br>
Black hair would never do for <mark1>Cleopatra.</mark1><br>
But you and I are not yet two old <mark1>women,</mark1><br>
And you're a man of office. What he <mark4>does</mark4><br>
Is more to you than how it is he does it, <mark1>--</mark1><br>
And that's what the Lord God has never told <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
They work together, and the Devil helps <mark1>'em;</mark1><br>
They do it of a morning, or if <mark1>not,</mark1><br>
They do it of a <mark4>night</mark4>, in which <mark4>event</mark4><br>
He's peevish of a morning. He seems <mark1>old;</mark1><br>
He's not the proper stomach or the sleep <mark3>--</mark3><br>
And they're two sovran agents to conserve <mark1>him</mark1><br>
Against the fiery art that has no <mark4>mercy</mark4><br>
But what's in that prodigious grand new <mark1>House.</mark1><br>
I gather something happening in his <mark4>boyhood</mark4><br>
Fulfilled him with a boy's <mark4>determination</mark4><br>
To make all Stratford 'ware of him. <mark1>Well</mark1>, <mark4>well,</mark4><br>
I hope at last he'll have his joy of <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
And all his pigs and sheep and bellowing beeves, <br>
And frogs and owls and unicorns, <mark1>moreover,</mark1><br>
Be less than hell to his attendant <mark4>ears.</mark4><br>
Oh, past a doubt we'll all go down to see <mark1>him.</mark1><br>
<br>
He may be wise. With London two days <mark1>off,</mark1><br>
Down there some wind of heaven may yet revive <mark1>him;</mark1><br>
But there's no quickening breath from <mark4>anywhere</mark4><br>
Small make of him again the poised young faun <br>
From Warwickshire, who'd made, it seems, <mark1>already</mark1><br>
A legend of himself before I <mark4>came</mark4><br>
To blink before the last of his first <mark4>lightning.</mark4><br>
Whatever there be, there'll be no more of <mark1>that;</mark1><br>
The coming on of his old monster <mark1>Time</mark1><br>
Has made him a still man; and he has <mark4>dreams</mark4><br>
Were fair to think on once, and all found <mark4>hollow.</mark4><br>
He knows how much of what men paint <mark4>themselves</mark4><br>
Would blister in the light of what they <mark4>are;</mark4><br>
He sees how much of what was great now <mark4>shares</mark4><br>
An eminence transformed and <mark4>ordinary;</mark4><br>
He knows too much of what the world has <mark4>hushed</mark4><br>
In others, to be loud now for <mark4>himself;</mark4><br>
He knows now at what height low <mark4>enemies</mark4><br>
May reach his heart, and high friends let him <mark4>fall;</mark4><br>
But what not even such as he may <mark5>know</mark5><br>
Bedevils him the worst: his lark may <mark4>sing</mark4><br>
At heaven's gate how he will, and for as <mark4>long</mark4><br>
As joy may listen, but he sees no <mark4>gate,</mark4><br>
Save one whereat the spent clay waits a <mark4>little</mark4><br>
Before the churchyard has it, and the <mark4>worm.</mark4><br>
Not long ago, late in an <mark1>afternoon,</mark1><br>
I came on him unseen down Lambeth <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
And on my life I was afear'd of <mark1>him:</mark1><br>
He gloomed and mumbled like a soul from Tophet, <br>
His hands behind him and his head bent <mark4>solemn.</mark4><br>
"What is it now," said I, -- "another <mark4>woman?"</mark4><br>
That made him sorry for me, and he <mark4>smiled.</mark4><br>
"No, Ben," he mused; "it's <mark1>Nothing</mark1>, It's all <mark4>Nothing.</mark4><br>
We come, we go; and when we're <mark1>done</mark1>, we're <mark4>done."</mark4><br>
Spiders and flies -- we're mostly one or t'other <mark4>--</mark4><br>
We come, we go; and when we're <mark1>done</mark1>, we're <mark1>done;</mark1><br>
"By God, you sing that song as if you knew <mark1>it!"</mark1><br>
Said I, by way of cheering him; "what ails <mark3>ye?"</mark3><br>
"I think I must have come down here to <mark4>think,"</mark4><br>
Says he to that, and pulls his little <mark4>beard;</mark4><br>
"Your fly will serve as well as <mark4>anybody,</mark4><br>
And what's his hour? He <mark1>flies</mark1>, and flies, and <mark4>flies,</mark4><br>
And in his fly's mind has a brave <mark4>appearance;</mark4><br>
And then your spider gets him in her <mark4>net,</mark4><br>
And eats him out, and hangs him up to <mark3>dry.</mark3><br>
That's Nature, the kind mother of us <mark1>all.</mark1><br>
And then your slattern housemaid swings her <mark4>broom,</mark4><br>
And where's your spider? And that's Nature, <mark4>also.</mark4><br>
It's Nature, and it's <mark1>Nothing</mark1>, It's all <mark1>Nothing.</mark1><br>
It's all a world where bugs and <mark4>emperors</mark4><br>
Go singularly back to the same <mark4>dust,</mark4><br>
Each in his time; and the old, ordered <mark4>stars</mark4><br>
That sang together, Ben, will sing the <mark4>same</mark4><br>
Old stave <mark3>to-morrow."</mark3><br>
<br>
When he talks like <mark1>that,</mark1><br>
There's nothing for a human man to <mark3>do</mark3><br>
But lead him to some grateful nook like <mark4>this</mark4><br>
Where we be now, and there to make him <mark3>drink.</mark3><br>
He'll drink, for love of me, and then be <mark4>sick;</mark4><br>
A sad sign always in a man of <mark4>parts,</mark4><br>
And always very ominous. The <mark4>great</mark4><br>
Should be as large in liquor as in love, <mark3>--</mark3><br>
And our great friend is not so large in <mark3>either:</mark3><br>
One disaffects <mark1>him</mark1>, and the other fails <mark1>him;</mark1><br>
Whatso he drinks that has an antic in <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
He's wondering what's to pay in his <mark4>insides;</mark4><br>
And while his eyes are on the <mark4>Cyprian</mark4><br>
He's fribbling all the time with that damned <mark1>House.</mark1><br>
We laugh here at his thrift, but after <mark1>all</mark1><br>
It may be thrift that saves him from the <mark4>devil;</mark4><br>
God gave it, anyhow, -- and we'll <mark1>suppose</mark1><br>
He knew the compound of his <mark4>handiwork.</mark4><br>
To-day the clouds are with him, but <mark5>anon</mark5><br>
He'll out of 'em enough to shake the <mark3>tree</mark3><br>
Of life itself and bring down fruit unheard-of, <mark3>--</mark3><br>
And, throwing in the bruised and whole <mark4>together,</mark4><br>
Prepare a wine to make us drunk with <mark4>wonder;</mark4><br>
And if he live, there'll be a sunset <mark4>spell</mark4><br>
Thrown over him as over a glassed <mark4>lake</mark4><br>
That yesterday was all a black wild <mark4>water.</mark4><br>
<br>
God send he live to give us, if no <mark1>more,</mark1><br>
What now's a-rampage in him, and <mark3>exhibit,</mark3><br>
With a decent half-allegiance to the <mark4>ages</mark4><br>
An earnest of at least a casual <mark1>eye</mark1><br>
Turned once on what he owes to <mark4>Gutenberg,</mark4><br>
And to the fealty of more <mark1>centuries</mark1><br>
Than are as yet a picture in our <mark1>vision.</mark1><br>
"There's time enough, -- I'll do it when I'm <mark1>old,</mark1><br>
And we're immortal men," he says to <mark1>that;</mark1><br>
And then he says to me, "Ben, what's 'immortal'? <br>
Think you by any force of <mark4>ordination</mark4><br>
It may be nothing of a sort more <mark4>noisy</mark4><br>
Than a small oblivion of component <mark4>ashes</mark4><br>
That of a dream-addicted world was <mark4>once</mark4><br>
A moving atomy much like your friend <mark1>here?"</mark1><br>
Nothing will help that man. To make him <mark1>laugh,</mark1><br>
I said then he was a mad mountebank, -- <br>
And by the Lord I nearer made him <mark3>cry.</mark3><br>
I could have eat an eft then, on my <mark1>knees,</mark1><br>
Tail, claws, and all of him; for I had <mark4>stung</mark4><br>
The king of men, who had no sting for <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
And I had hurt him in his <mark4>memories;</mark4><br>
And I say now, as I shall say <mark1>again,</mark1><br>
I love the man this side <mark4>idolatry.</mark4><br>
<br>
He'll do it when he's old, he says. I <mark1>wonder.</mark1><br>
He may not be so ancient as all <mark1>that.</mark1><br>
For such as he, the thing that is to <mark1>do</mark1><br>
Will do itself, -- but there's a <mark4>reckoning;</mark4><br>
The sessions that are now too much his <mark4>own,</mark4><br>
The roiling inward of a stilled <mark4>outside,</mark4><br>
The churning out of all those blood-fed <mark4>lines,</mark4><br>
The nights of many schemes and little <mark1>sleep,</mark1><br>
The full brain hammered hot with too much <mark4>thinking,</mark4><br>
The vexed heart over-worn with too much aching, <mark4>--</mark4><br>
This weary jangling of conjoined <mark4>affairs</mark4><br>
Made out of elements that have no <mark4>end,</mark4><br>
And all confused at once, I <mark4>understand,</mark4><br>
Is not what makes a man to live <mark4>forever.</mark4><br>
O no, not now! He'll not be going <mark1>now:</mark1><br>
There'll be time yet for God knows what <mark4>explosions</mark4><br>
Before he goes. He'll stay awhile. Just <mark4>wait:</mark4><br>
Just wait a year or two for <mark1>Cleopatra,</mark1><br>
For she's to be a balsam and a <mark4>comfort;</mark4><br>
And that's not all a jape of mine now, <mark1>either.</mark1><br>
For granted once the old way of <mark4>Apollo</mark4><br>
Sings in a man, he may then, if he's <mark4>able,</mark4><br>
Strike unafraid whatever strings he <mark1>will</mark1><br>
Upon the last and wildest of new lyres; <br>
Nor out of his new magic, though it <mark2>hymn</mark2><br>
The shrieks of dungeoned hell, shall he <mark4>create</mark4><br>
A madness or a gloom to shut quite <mark1>out</mark1><br>
A cleaving daylight, and a last great <mark4>calm</mark4><br>
Triumphant over shipwreck and all <mark4>storms.</mark4><br>
He might have given Aristotle <mark4>creeps,</mark4><br>
But surely would have given him his katharsis. <br>
<br>
He'll not be going <mark1>yet</mark1>, There's too much <mark4>yet</mark4><br>
Unsung within the man. But when he <mark4>goes,</mark4><br>
I'd stake ye coin o' the realm his only <mark1>care</mark1><br>
For a phantom world he sounded and found <mark4>wanting</mark4><br>
Will be a portion <mark4>here</mark4>, a portion <mark1>there,</mark1><br>
Of this or that thing or some other <mark4>thing</mark4><br>
That has a patent and intrinsical <br>
Equivalence in those egregious <mark1>shillings.</mark1><br>
And yet he knows, God help him! Tell me, <mark1>now,</mark1><br>
If ever there was anything let <mark4>loose</mark4><br>
On earth by gods or devils <mark4>heretofore</mark4><br>
Like this mad, careful, proud, indifferent <mark4>Shakespeare!</mark4><br>
Where was it, if it ever was? By <mark4>heaven,</mark4><br>
'Twas never yet in Rhodes or Pergamon <mark4>--</mark4><br>
In Thebes or Nineveh, a thing like <mark1>this!</mark1><br>
No thing like this was ever out of <mark4>England;</mark4><br>
And that he <mark4>knows</mark4>, I wonder if he <mark4>cares.</mark4><br>
Perhaps he does .... O <mark4>Lord</mark4>, that House in <mark1>Stratford!</mark1><br>
