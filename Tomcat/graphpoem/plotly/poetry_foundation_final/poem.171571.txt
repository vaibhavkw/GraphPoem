Title : For No Clear Reason <br>
Author : Robert Creeley <br><br>

I dreamt last <mark4>night</mark4><br>
the fright was over, <mark4>that</mark4><br>
the dust came, and then <mark4>water,</mark4><br>
and women and men, <mark4>together</mark4><br>
again, and all was <mark4>quiet</mark4><br>
in the dim moon's <mark4>light.</mark4><br>
<br>
A paean of such patience-- <br>
laughing, laughing at me,   <br>
and the days extend <mark4>over</mark4><br>
the earth's great <mark4>cover,</mark4><br>
grass, trees, and <mark4>flower-</mark4><br>
ing <mark3>season</mark3>, for no clear <mark3>reason.</mark3><br>
