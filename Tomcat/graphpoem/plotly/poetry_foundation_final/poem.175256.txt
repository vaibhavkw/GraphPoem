Title : A New York Child's Garden of Verses <br>
Author : Franklin Pierce Adams <br><br>

(With the usual.)<br>
<br>
In winter I get up at <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
And dress by an electric <mark3>light.</mark3><br>
In summer, autumn, ay, and <mark3>spring,</mark3><br>
I have to do the self-same <mark3>thing.</mark3><br>
I have to go to bed and <mark3>hear</mark3><br>
<br>
Pianos pounding in my <mark3>ear,</mark3><br>
And hear the janitor <mark4>cavort</mark4><br>
With garbage cans within the <mark3>court.</mark3><br>
And does it not seem hard to <mark3>you</mark3><br>
<br>
That I should have these things to <mark3>do?</mark3><br>
Is it not hard for us Manhat- <br>
Tan children in a stuffy <mark4>flat?</mark4><br>
It is very nice to <mark5>think</mark5><br>
<br>
The world is full of food and <mark3>drink;</mark3><br>
<br>
But, oh, my father says to me <br>
They cost all of his salaree. <br>
When I am grown to man's <mark4>estate</mark4><br>
I shall be very proud and <mark3>great;</mark3><br>
<br>
E'en now I have no <mark4>reverence,</mark4><br>
<br>
'Cause I read comic <mark4>supplements.</mark4><br>
New York is so full of a number of <mark4>kids</mark4><br>
I'm sure pretty soon we shall be <mark4>invalids.</mark4><br>
A child should always say what's <mark3>true,</mark3><br>
<br>
And speak when he is spoken <mark3>to;</mark3><br>
<br>
And then, when manhood's age he <mark4>strikes,</mark4><br>
He may be boorish as he <mark3>likes.</mark3><br>
