Title : Pink Slip at Tool & Dye <br>
Author : Dave Smith <br><br>

He can only drink tea now, screwed and <mark4>filed.</mark4><br>
She is dead, in metal <mark4>flecks.</mark4><br>
<br>
55 years old and look like a bad nail <br>
by God they yanked me <mark4>out</mark4><br>
I can tell you<br>
<br>
soon as the hurt come son shut <mark4>up</mark4><br>
it don't mean <mark4>nothing</mark4><br>
but listen: you got time for a <mark4>ride?</mark4><br>
<br>
Habit's put the glass in his hands, the brown <br>
tasteless tea, slime, and <mark4>cigarettes.</mark4><br>
<br>
Every Sunday the same, old dog<br>
fat at his <mark4>feet.</mark4><br>
Ain't so much me I'm asking <mark4>for</mark4><br>
dog like to get out and <mark4>piss</mark4><br>
think they <mark4>remember.</mark4><br>
<br>
Near the main gate of Gary Steel I <mark4>stop.</mark4><br>
The amber light pours out of stacked <mark4>horizons,</mark4><br>
monstrous cranes hang over <mark4>suburbs.</mark4><br>
<br>
She think that piss mean <mark4>something</mark4><br>
it don't mean <mark1>nothing.</mark1><br>
Turning back in the dark, headlights flash <br>
on our faces, bent, light of a woman's <mark4>hair.</mark4><br>
