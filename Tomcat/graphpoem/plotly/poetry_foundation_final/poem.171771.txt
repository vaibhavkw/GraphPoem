Title : Giant Night <br>
Author : Anne Waldman <br><br>

Awake in a giant <mark4>night</mark4><br>
is where I <mark4>am</mark4><br>
There is a river where my <mark4>soul,</mark4><br>
hungry as a horse drinks beside <mark1>me</mark1><br>
<br>
An hour of immense possibility flies <mark3>by</mark3><br>
and I do nothing but sit in the <mark4>present</mark4><br>
which keeps changing moment to <mark4>moment</mark4><br>
<br>
How can I tell you my mind is a <mark4>blanket?</mark4><br>
<br>
It is an amazing story you won't <mark4>believe</mark4><br>
and a beautiful <mark4>land</mark4><br>
where something is always doing in the <mark4>barns</mark4><br>
especially in <mark4>autumn</mark4><br>
                         Sliding down the hayrick! <br>
<br>
By March the sun is lingering and the land turns <mark4>wet</mark4><br>
<br>
Brooks grow <mark4>loud</mark4><br>
The eddies fill with green <mark4>scum</mark4><br>
Crocuses lift their heads to say <mark3>hello</mark3><br>
<br>
Soon it is good to be <mark4>planting</mark4><br>
By then the woods are <mark4>overflowing</mark4><br>
with dogwood, redbud, hickory, red and white <mark4>oaks,</mark4><br>
hazelnut bushes, violets, <mark4>jacks-in-the-pulpit,</mark4><br>
skunk <mark4>cabbages</mark4>, pawpaws and May <mark4>apples</mark4><br>
whose names thrill you because you can name <mark4>them!</mark4><br>
<br>
There are quail and rabbits too--but I go on too <mark4>long</mark4><br>
<br>
Like the animal, I must stop by the water's edge   <br>
to have a drink and think things <mark5>over</mark5><br>
<br>
That was good. The drink I <mark4>mean</mark4><br>
<br>
I feel refreshed and ready for <mark4>anything</mark4><br>
Though I'm not in Vermont or Kentucky <mark4>unfortunately</mark4><br>
but in New York City, the toughest place in the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
And it's <mark4>December</mark4><br>
<br>
Here someone is always weeping, including <mark1>me</mark1><br>
<br>
though I tend to cry in monster waves then turn into a fish   <br>
wallowing in my own <mark4>salty</mark4><br>
Puddle! Look <mark4>out</mark4><br>
If you aren't wearing boots you'll be <mark4>sorry</mark4><br>
and soggy <mark3>too</mark3><br>
This season's cruelty hurts <mark1>me</mark1><br>
<br>
and others, I'm sure, who'd rather be elsewhere but <mark4>can't</mark4><br>
<br>
because of their jobs, families, friends, <mark4>money</mark4><br>
It's rough anyway you look at <mark4>it</mark4><br>
But what can you <mark3>do?</mark3><br>
It's worse <mark4>elsewhere</mark4>, I'm <mark4>sure</mark4><br>
<br>
Take <mark4>Vietnam</mark4><br>
<br>
No <mark4>thanks</mark4><br>
<br>
I think about Vietnam a lot, <mark4>however</mark4><br>
<br>
and wonder if I'll ever "see" <mark1>it</mark1><br>
<br>
The way I've seen Europe, I <mark1>mean</mark1><br>
Those pretty Dutch <mark4>girls!</mark4><br>
They all ride <mark4>bicycles</mark4><br>
<br>
In Venice you travel by boat or <mark4>foot</mark4><br>
The metro and the underground register like the <mark4>names</mark4><br>
<br>
in connection with <mark1>them:</mark1><br>
<br>
Hugo, Stephen, Stuart, Larry, Lee, Harry, David, <mark3>Maxine</mark3><br>
What does it all <mark1>mean?</mark1><br>
<br>
I never ask that, being <mark3>shy</mark3><br>
<br>
In this apartment in which I dwell these thoughts pass <mark1>by</mark1><br>
I hope you won't mind the mess when you do <mark1>too</mark1><br>
<br>
You just walk in up a flight and you're in <mark4>paradise</mark4><br>
<br>
A cup of coffee, an easy chair, a loving person waiting for <mark3>you</mark3><br>
<br>
who's washing the dishes, reading a book <br>
<br>
Outside someone's worrying about love and not sitting down <mark4>either</mark4><br>
<br>
He's probably freezing his ass off right now! <br>
And other vital parts which would feel great in the <mark4>country,</mark4><br>
<br>
taking a walk, a hike, shoveling <mark3>snow</mark3><br>
<br>
Though you can do that right <mark4>here</mark4><br>
The hub of the universe is where I am in a night whose <mark4>promise</mark4><br>
grows with me, unlike the snow melting in the <mark4>gutter</mark4><br>
<br>
Whatever I do, it is beside <mark1>me</mark1><br>
<br>
I look out the window, there is <mark1>night</mark1><br>
<br>
I sit in this lighted room knowing this <mark1>night</mark1><br>
Night! Night! I wish you'd go so I could <mark3>go</mark3><br>
<br>
to the post office, the bank, the <mark4>supermarket</mark4><br>
<br>
Why aren't they open at night? I <mark4>wonder</mark4><br>
Then realize I'm not the only person <mark4>who's</mark4><br>
considered in the grand scope of daily <mark4>living</mark4><br>
There are those fast asleep who want to be and would be <mark4>horrified</mark4><br>
<br>
if the post office, the bank, and the <mark1>supermarket</mark1><br>
were only open at <mark1>night</mark1><br>
for you can't be all there all the <mark4>time</mark4><br>
<br>
I myself am only here part of the <mark1>time</mark1><br>
which is enough <br>
For there are other places to run <mark3>to</mark3><br>
Uptown, for example, where energy rushes <mark1>you</mark1><br>
like some hideous but intriguing <mark4>chemical</mark4><br>
you can't <mark4>ignore</mark4><br>
and you want to absorb the wisdom these buildings <mark4>have</mark4><br>
<br>
How do they feel so high up like <mark4>that?</mark4><br>
Pretty good, they seem to say in their absolute <mark5>way</mark5><br>
But it's the people inside who turn us <mark4>on</mark4><br>
By then you are gone off in a cab   <br>
<br>
and you are not <mark4>alone</mark4><br>
<br>
I am beside <mark1>you</mark1><br>
The streets are familiar from just traveling <mark3>through</mark3><br>
<br>
We rarely stop and when we do there's a <mark4>reason</mark4><br>
Which is too <mark4>bad</mark4><br>
<br>
We miss a lot for this same <mark1>reason</mark1><br>
<br>
They're probably feeding the chickens about this <mark1>time</mark1><br>
The smell of chicken feed overwhelms <mark1>me</mark1><br>
<br>
The rooster crows on a 7th Street fire <mark4>escape</mark4><br>
Breakfast is <mark4>ready</mark4><br>
<br>
There is a forest by the river near the <mark4>barn</mark4><br>
<br>
where things are <mark4>happening,</mark4><br>
a whole new world on the edge of <mark4>dawn</mark4><br>
My little world goes on St. Mark's <mark4>Place</mark4><br>
To be not tired, but elated, I sing this <mark4>song</mark4><br>
I think of The Beatles and The Beach <mark4>Boys</mark4><br>
and the songs they <mark4>sing</mark4><br>
It is a different thing to be behind the <mark4>sound</mark4><br>
<br>
then leave it <mark4>forever</mark4><br>
<br>
and it goes on without them, needing only you and <mark1>me</mark1><br>
<br>
Here I am, though you are <mark4>asleep</mark4><br>
<br>
The morning of December 3rd dawns on <mark1>me</mark1><br>
in the shape of a poem called "Giant <mark1>Night"</mark1><br>
<br>
It must end before it is too <mark4>late</mark4><br>
All over the world children will celebrate <mark4>Christmas</mark4><br>
And families will gather together to give and take this <mark4>season</mark4><br>
<br>
Other religions and customs will prevail in their own separate <mark4>ways</mark4><br>
<br>
having nothing to do with <mark1>Christmas</mark1><br>
Soldiers will cease <mark4>fire</mark4><br>
<br>
Some won't know the difference but might be able to sense <mark1>it</mark1><br>
<br>
in the <mark4>air</mark4><br>
The smell of holly, pine, eggnog <br>
<br>
The friendly faces of Santa and his <mark4>elves</mark4><br>
All these will add up to something and be gone <mark1>forever</mark1><br>
<br>
Just like what is here one minute and not the <mark4>next.</mark4><br>
