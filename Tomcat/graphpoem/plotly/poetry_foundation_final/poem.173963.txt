Title : The Tropics in New York <br>
Author : Claude McKay <br><br>

Bananas ripe and green, and <mark3>ginger-root,</mark3><br>
Cocoa in pods and alligator <mark3>pears,</mark3><br>
And tangerines and mangoes and grape <mark3>fruit,</mark3><br>
Fit for the highest prize at parish <mark3>fairs,</mark3><br>
<br>
Set in the window, bringing <mark4>memories</mark4><br>
      Of fruit-trees laden by low-singing rills,<br>
And dewy <mark4>dawns</mark4>, and mystical blue <mark4>skies</mark4><br>
In benediction over nun-like <mark4>hills.</mark4><br>
<br>
My eyes grew dim, and I could no more <mark4>gaze;</mark4><br>
A wave of longing through my body <mark4>swept,</mark4><br>
And, hungry for the old, familiar <mark3>ways,</mark3><br>
I turned aside and bowed my head and <mark3>wept.</mark3><br>
