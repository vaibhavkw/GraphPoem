Author : Michael Drayton <br><br>

You brave Heroique <mark3>Minds,</mark3><br>
Worthy your countries <mark3>name,</mark3><br>
That honour still <mark3>pursue,</mark3><br>
Goe, and <mark3>subdue,</mark3><br>
Whilst loyt'ring <mark3>Hinds</mark3><br>
Lurke here at <mark4>home</mark4>, with <mark3>shame.</mark3><br>
<br>
Britans, you stay too <mark3>long,</mark3><br>
Quickly aboord bestow <mark3>you,</mark3><br>
And with a merry <mark3>Gale</mark3><br>
Swell your stretch'd <mark3>Sayle,</mark3><br>
With Vowes as <mark3>strong,</mark3><br>
As the Winds that blow <mark1>you.</mark1><br>
<br>
Your Course securely <mark4>steere,</mark4><br>
West and by South forth keepe,<br>
Rocks, <mark4>Lee-shores</mark4>, nor <mark4>Sholes,</mark4><br>
    When Eolus scowles,<br>
You need not feare,<br>
So absolute the Deepe.<br>
<br>
And cheerfully at <mark3>Sea,</mark3><br>
Successe you still intice,<br>
To get the Pearle and <mark3>Gold,</mark3><br>
And ours to <mark3>hold,</mark3><br>
<br>
Earth's onely <mark4>Paradise.</mark4><br>
<br>
Where nature hath in <mark4>store</mark4><br>
Fowle, Venison, and <mark3>Fish,</mark3><br>
    And the fruitfull'st Soyle,<br>
    Without your Toyle,<br>
Three Harvests <mark3>more,</mark3><br>
All greater than your <mark3>wish.</mark3><br>
<br>
And the ambitious <mark3>Vine</mark3><br>
Crownes with his purple <mark4>Masse,</mark4><br>
    The Cedar reaching hie<br>
    To kisse the Sky,<br>
The Cypresse, <mark3>Pine</mark3><br>
And use-full <mark4>Sassafras.</mark4><br>
<br>
To whose, the golden <mark1>Age</mark1><br>
Still Natures lawes doth <mark3>give,</mark3><br>
No other Cares that <mark4>tend,</mark4><br>
But Them to <mark3>defend</mark3><br>
From Winters <mark1>age,</mark1><br>
That long there doth not <mark3>live.</mark3><br>
<br>
When as the Lushious <mark4>smell</mark4><br>
Of that delicious <mark4>Land,</mark4><br>
    Above the Seas that flowes,<br>
    The cleere Wind throwes,<br>
Your Hearts to <mark3>swell</mark3><br>
Approching the deare <mark3>Strand.</mark3><br>
<br>
In kenning of the <mark3>Shore,</mark3><br>
(Thanks to God first <mark4>given,)</mark4><br>
O you, the happy'st <mark4>men,</mark4><br>
Be Frolike <mark3>then,</mark3><br>
Let Cannons roare,<br>
Frighting the wide <mark4>Heaven.</mark4><br>
<br>
And in Regions farre<br>
Such Heroes bring yee foorth,<br>
As those from whom We <mark3>came,</mark3><br>
And plant Our <mark1>name,</mark1><br>
Under that Starre<br>
Not knowne unto our North.<br>
<br>
And as there Plenty growes<br>
Of Lawrell every <mark4>where,</mark4><br>
Apollo's Sacred <mark3>tree,</mark3><br>
You it may <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
A Poets Browes<br>
To crowne, that may sing <mark3>there.</mark3><br>
<br>
Thy Voyage <mark4>attend,</mark4><br>
<br>
Whose Reading shall <mark3>inflame</mark3><br>
Men to seeke <mark3>Fame,</mark3><br>
And much <mark3>commend</mark3><br>
To after-times thy Wit.<br>
