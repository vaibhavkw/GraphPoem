Title : I Abide and Abide and Better Abide <br>
Author : Sir Thomas Wyatt <br><br>

I abide and abide and better <mark3>abide,</mark3><br>
And after the old proverb, the happy <mark3>day;</mark3><br>
And ever my lady to me doth <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
"Let me alone and I will <mark3>provide."</mark3><br>
I abide and abide and tarry the <mark3>tide,</mark3><br>
And with abiding speed well ye <mark3>may.</mark3><br>
Thus do I abide I wot alway, <br>
Nother obtaining nor yet <mark3>denied.</mark3><br>
Ay me! this long <mark5>abiding</mark5><br>
Seemeth to me, as who <mark5>sayeth,</mark5><br>
A prolonging of a dying death, <br>
Or a refusing of a desir'd <mark4>thing.</mark4><br>
Much were it better for to be <mark3>plain</mark3><br>
Than to say "abide" and yet shall not <mark3>obtain.</mark3><br>
