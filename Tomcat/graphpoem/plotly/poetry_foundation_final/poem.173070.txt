Title : Tam Glen <br>
Author : Robert Burns <br><br>

My heart is a-breaking, dear Tittie, <br>
Some counsel unto me come <mark3>len';</mark3><br>
To anger them a' is a <mark4>pity,</mark4><br>
But what will I do wi' Tam <mark3>Glen?</mark3><br>
<br>
I'm thinking, wi' sic a braw <mark4>fellow,</mark4><br>
In poortith I might mak a <mark3>fen':</mark3><br>
What care I in riches to <mark4>wallow,</mark4><br>
If I mauna marry Tam <mark1>Glen?</mark1><br>
<br>
There's Lowrie, the laird o' Dumeller, <br>
"Guid-day to you,"--brute! he comes <mark3>ben:</mark3><br>
He brags and he blaws o' his siller, <br>
But when will he dance like Tam <mark1>Glen?</mark1><br>
<br>
My minnie does constantly deave <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
And bids me beware o' young <mark3>men;</mark3><br>
They flatter, she says, to deceive <mark1>me;</mark1><br>
But wha can think sae o' Tam <mark1>Glen?</mark1><br>
<br>
My daddie says, gin I'll forsake <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
He'll gie me guid hunder marks <mark3>ten:</mark3><br>
But, if it's ordain'd I maun take <mark1>him,</mark1><br>
O wha will I get but Tam <mark1>Glen?</mark1><br>
<br>
Yestreen at the valentines' <mark4>dealing,</mark4><br>
My heart to my mou gied a <mark3>sten:</mark3><br>
For thrice I drew ane without <mark4>failing,</mark4><br>
And thrice it was <mark4>written</mark4>, "Tam <mark1>Glen"!</mark1><br>
<br>
The last Halloween I was waukin <br>
My droukit sark-sleeve, as ye <mark3>ken:</mark3><br>
His likeness cam up the house staukin, <br>
And the very gray breeks o' Tam <mark1>Glen!</mark1><br>
<br>
Come counsel, dear Tittie, don't <mark4>tarry;</mark4><br>
I'll gie ye my bonie black <mark3>hen,</mark3><br>
Gif ye will advise me to <mark3>marry</mark3><br>
The lad I lo'e dearly, Tam <mark1>Glen.</mark1><br>
