Title : [love is more thicker than forget]<br>
Author : E. E. Cummings<br><br>

love is more thicker than <mark3>forget</mark3><br>
more thinner than <mark4>recall</mark4><br>
more seldom than a wave is <mark3>wet</mark3><br>
more frequent than to <mark4>fail</mark4><br>
<br>
it is most mad and moonly<br>
and less it shall unbe<br>
than all the sea which <mark1>only</mark1><br>
is deeper than the sea<br>
<br>
love is less always than to <mark3>win</mark3><br>
less never than <mark4>alive</mark4><br>
less bigger than the least <mark3>begin</mark3><br>
less littler than <mark4>forgive</mark4><br>
<br>
it is most sane and sunly<br>
and more it cannot <mark3>die</mark3><br>
than all the sky which <mark1>only</mark1><br>
is higher than the <mark3>sky</mark3><br>
