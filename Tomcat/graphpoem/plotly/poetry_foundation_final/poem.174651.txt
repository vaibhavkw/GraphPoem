Title : from The Princess: Tears, Idle Tears <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

Tears, idle tears, I know not what they <mark4>mean,</mark4><br>
Tears from the depth of some divine <mark4>despair</mark4><br>
Rise in the heart, and gather to the <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
In looking on the happy <mark4>Autumn-fields,</mark4><br>
And thinking of the days that are no <mark4>more.</mark4><br>
<br>
         Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail, <br>
That brings our friends up from the underworld, <br>
Sad as the last which reddens over <mark4>one</mark4><br>
That sinks with all we love below the verge; <br>
So sad, so fresh, the days that are no <mark1>more.</mark1><br>
<br>
Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer <mark4>dawns</mark4><br>
The earliest pipe of half-awaken'd <mark4>birds</mark4><br>
To dying <mark4>ears</mark4>, when unto dying <mark1>eyes</mark1><br>
The casement slowly grows a glimmering <mark4>square;</mark4><br>
So sad, so strange, the days that are no <mark1>more.</mark1><br>
<br>
         Dear as remember'd kisses after death, <br>
And sweet as those by hopeless fancy <mark4>feign'd</mark4><br>
On lips that are for others; deep as love, <br>
Deep as first love, and wild with all regret; <br>
O Death in Life, the days that are no <mark1>more!</mark1><br>
