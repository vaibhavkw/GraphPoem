Title : March: An Ode <br>
Author : Algernon Charles Swinburne <br><br>

<br>
Ere frost-flower and snow-blossom faded and fell, and the splendour of winter had passed out of <mark3>sight,</mark3><br>
The ways of the woodlands were fairer and stranger than dreams that fulfil us in sleep with <mark3>delight;</mark3><br>
The breath of the mouths of the winds had hardened on tree-tops and branches that glittered and <mark3>swayed</mark3><br>
Such wonders and glories of blossomlike snow or of frost that outlightens all flowers till it <mark3>fade</mark3><br>
That the sea was not lovelier than here was the land, nor the night than the day, nor the day than the <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
Nor the winter sublimer with storm than the spring: such mirth had the madness and might in thee <mark3>made,</mark3><br>
March, master of winds, bright minstrel and marshal of storms that enkindle the season they smite. <br>
<br>
And now that the rage of thy rapture is satiate with revel and ravin and spoil of the <mark3>snow,</mark3><br>
And the branches it brightened are broken, and shattered the tree-tops that only thy wrath could lay <mark3>low,</mark3><br>
How should not thy lovers rejoice in thee, leader and lord of the year that exults to be <mark3>born</mark3><br>
So strong in thy strength and so glad of thy gladness whose laughter puts winter and sorrow to <mark3>scorn?</mark3><br>
Thou hast shaken the snows from thy wings, and the frost on thy forehead is molten: thy lips are <mark3>aglow</mark3><br>
As a lover's that kindle with kissing, and earth, with her raiment and tresses yet wasted and <mark3>torn,</mark3><br>
Takes breath as she smiles in the grasp of thy passion to feel through her spirit the sense of thee <mark3>flow.</mark3><br>
Fain, fain would we see but again for an hour what the wind and the sun have dispelled and <mark4>consumed,</mark4><br>
<br>
Those full deep swan-soft feathers of snow with whose luminous burden the branches implumed <br>
Hung heavily, curved as a half-bent bow, and fledged not as birds are, but petalled as <mark5>flowers,</mark5><br>
Each tree-top and branchlet a pinnacle jewelled and carved, or a fountain that shines as it <mark3>showers,</mark3><br>
But fixed as a fountain is fixed not, and wrought not to last till by time or by tempest <mark3>entombed,</mark3><br>
As a pinnacle carven and gilded of men: for the date of its doom is no more than an <mark3>hour's,</mark3><br>
One hour of the sun's when the warm wind wakes him to wither the snow-flowers that froze as they <mark3>bloomed.</mark3><br>
As the sunshine quenches the snowshine; as April subdues thee, and yields up his kingdom to <mark3>May;</mark3><br>
So time overcomes the regret that is born of delight as it passes in passion <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
<br>
And leaves but a dream for desire to rejoice in or mourn for with tears or thanksgivings; but <mark3>thou,</mark3><br>
Bright god that art gone from us, maddest and gladdest of months, to what goal hast thou gone from us <mark3>now?</mark3><br>
For somewhere surely the storm of thy laughter that lightens, the beat of thy wings that <mark3>play,</mark3><br>
Must flame as a fire through the world, and the heavens that we know not rejoice in thee: surely thy <mark3>brow</mark3><br>
Hath lost not its radiance of empire, thy spirit the joy that impelled it on quest as for <mark3>prey.</mark3><br>
Are thy feet on the ways of the limitless waters, thy wings on the winds of the waste north <mark3>sea?</mark3><br>
Are the fires of the false north dawn over heavens where summer is stormful and strong like <mark3>thee</mark3><br>
Now bright in the sight of thine eyes? are the bastions of icebergs assailed by the blast of thy <mark3>breath?</mark3><br>
<br>
Is it March with the wild north world when April is waning? the word that the changed year saith, <br>
Is it echoed to northward with rapture of passion reiterate from spirits triumphant as <mark3>we</mark3><br>
Whose hearts were uplift at the blast of thy clarions as men's rearisen from a sleep that was <mark3>death</mark3><br>
And kindled to life that was one with the world's and with thine? hast thou set not the whole world <mark3>free?</mark3><br>
For the breath of thy lips is freedom, and freedom's the sense of thy spirit, the sound of thy <mark3>song,</mark3><br>
Glad god of the north-east wind, whose heart is as high as the hands of thy kingdom are <mark3>strong,</mark3><br>
Thy kingdom whose empire is terror and joy, twin-featured and fruitful of births <mark4>divine,</mark4><br>
Days lit with the flame of the lamps of the flowers, and nights that are drunken with dew for <mark3>wine,</mark3><br>
<br>
And sleep not for joy of the stars that deepen and quicken, a denser and fierier <mark3>throng,</mark3><br>
And the world that thy breath bade whiten and tremble rejoices at heart as they strengthen and <mark3>shine,</mark3><br>
And earth gives thanks for the glory bequeathed her, and knows of thy reign that it wrought not <mark3>wrong.</mark3><br>
Thy spirit is quenched not, albeit we behold not thy face in the crown of the steep sky's <mark3>arch,</mark3><br>
And the bold first buds of the whin wax golden, and witness arise of the thorn and the <mark3>larch:</mark3><br>
Wild April, enkindled to laughter and storm by the kiss of the wildest of winds that <mark3>blow,</mark3><br>
Calls loud on his brother for witness; his hands that were laden with blossom are sprinkled with <mark1>snow,</mark1><br>
And his lips breathe winter, and laugh, and relent; and the live woods feel not the frost's flame <mark3>parch;</mark3><br>
<br>
For the flame of the spring that consumes not but quickens is felt at the heart of the forest <mark1>aglow,</mark1><br>
And the sparks that enkindled and fed it were strewn from the hands of the gods of the winds of <mark3>March.</mark3><br>
