Title : When 'Midst the Gay I Meet <br>
Author : Thomas Moore <br><br>

When 'midst the gay I <mark3>meet</mark3><br>
That gentle smile of <mark3>thine,</mark3><br>
Though still on me it turns most <mark3>sweet,</mark3><br>
I scarce can call it <mark3>mine:</mark3><br>
But when to me <mark4>alone</mark4><br>
Your secret tears you <mark3>show,</mark3><br>
Oh, then I feel those tears my <mark3>own,</mark3><br>
And claim them while they <mark3>flow.</mark3><br>
Then still with bright looks <mark3>bless</mark3><br>
The gay, the cold, the <mark3>free;</mark3><br>
Give smiles to those who love you <mark3>less,</mark3><br>
But keep your tears for <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
<br>
The snow on Jura's <mark3>steep</mark3><br>
Can smile in many a <mark3>beam,</mark3><br>
Yet still in chains of coldness <mark3>sleep,</mark3><br>
How bright soe'er it <mark3>seem.</mark3><br>
But, when some deep-felt <mark3>ray,</mark3><br>
Whose touch is fire, <mark3>appears,</mark3><br>
Oh, then the smile is warm'd <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
And, melting, turns to <mark3>tears.</mark3><br>
Then still with bright looks <mark1>bless</mark1><br>
The gay, the cold, the <mark1>free;</mark1><br>
Give smiles to those who love you <mark1>less,</mark1><br>
But keep your tears for <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
