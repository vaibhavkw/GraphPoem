Title : The Virgin Considered as a Picture <br>
Author : Edgar Bowers <br><br>

Her unawed face, whose pose so long <mark3>assumed</mark3><br>
Is touched with what reality we <mark3>feel,</mark3><br>
Bends to itself <mark4>and</mark4>, to itself <mark3>resumed,</mark3><br>
Restores a tender fiction to the <mark3>real.</mark3><br>
<br>
And in her artful posture movement <mark3>lies</mark3><br>
Whose timeless motion flesh must so <mark3>conceal;</mark3><br>
Yet what her pose conceals we might <mark3>surmise</mark3><br>
And might pretend to gather from her <mark3>eyes</mark3><br>
<br>
The final motion flesh gives up to <mark3>art.</mark3><br>
But slowly, if we watch her long <mark1>enough,</mark1><br>
The nerves grow subtler, and she moves <mark3>apart</mark3><br>
<br>
Into a space too dim with time and <mark4>blood</mark4><br>
For our set eyes to follow true <mark1>enough,</mark1><br>
Or nerves to guess about her, if they <mark4>would.</mark4><br>
