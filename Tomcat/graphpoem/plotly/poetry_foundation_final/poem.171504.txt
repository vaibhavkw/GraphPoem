Title : In the Deep Channel <br>
Author : William E. Stafford <br><br>

Setting a trotline after sundown <br>
if we went far enough away in the <mark4>night</mark4><br>
sometimes up out of deep <mark4>water</mark4><br>
would come a secret-headed channel <mark4>cat,</mark4><br>
<br>
Eyes that were still eyes in the rush of darkness,   <br>
flowing feelers noncommittal and <mark3>black,</mark3><br>
and hidden in the fins those rasping bone daggers,   <br>
with one spiking upward on its <mark3>back.</mark3><br>
<br>
We would come at daylight and find the line sag,   <br>
the fishbelly gleam and the rush on the <mark4>tether:</mark4><br>
to feel the swerve and the deep <mark4>current</mark4><br>
which tugged at the tree roots below the <mark4>river.</mark4><br>
