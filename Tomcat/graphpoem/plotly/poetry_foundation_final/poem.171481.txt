Title : Sentimental <br>
Author : Albert Goldbarth <br><br>

The light has traveled unthinkable thousands of miles to <mark3>be</mark3><br>
condensed, recharged, and poured off the white white <mark4>pages</mark4><br>
of an open Bible the country parson holds in front of this <mark4>couple</mark4><br>
in a field, in <mark1>July</mark1>, in the sap and the flyswirl of <mark1>July</mark1><br>
in upper Wisconsin, where their vows buzz in a ring in the <mark3>air</mark3><br>
like the flies, and are as sweet as the sap, in these rich and ritual <mark4>minutes.</mark4><br>
Is it sentimental? Oops. And out of that Bible the light <mark4>continues</mark4><br>
to rush as if from a faucet. There will be a piecrust <mark4>cooling</mark4><br>
out of its own few x'ed-out cuts. And will it make us <mark4>run</mark4><br>
for the picklier taste of irony rolled around protectively on our <mark4>tongues</mark4><br>
like a grab of Greek olives? My students and I discuss <mark4>this</mark4><br>
slippery phenomenon. Does "context" matter? <mark4>Does</mark4><br>
"earned" count? If a balled-up fidget of <mark4>snakes</mark4><br>
in the underbrush dies in a freeze is it sentimental? No,   <br>
yes, maybe. What if a litter of cocker spaniels? <mark4>What</mark4><br>
if we called them "puppydogs" in the same poem in that same <mark4>hard,</mark4><br>
hammering winter? When my father was <mark4>buried,</mark4><br>
the gray snow in the cemetery was sheet tin. If I <mark4>said</mark4><br>
that? Yes, no, what does "tone" or "history" <mark3>do</mark3><br>
to the Hollywood hack violinists who patiently wait to play   <br>
the taut nerves of the closest human body until from <mark4>that</mark4><br>
lush cue alone, the eyes swell moistly, and the griefs <br>
we warehouse daily take advantage of this <mark4>thinning</mark4><br>
of our systems, then the first sloppy gushes begin . . <mark4>.</mark4><br>
Is that "wrong"? Did I tell you the <mark4>breaths</mark4><br>
of the gravediggers puffed out like <mark5>factorysmoke</mark5><br>
as they bent and <mark1>straightened</mark1>, bent and <mark4>straightened,</mark4><br>
mechanically? Are wise old (toothless) Black blues <mark4>singers</mark4><br>
sentimental?--"gran'ma"? "country cookin'"? <mark4>But</mark4><br>
they have their validity, don't they, yes? <mark3>their</mark3><br>
sweat-in-the-creases, picking up the <mark4>lighting</mark4><br>
in a fine-lined mesh of what it means to have gone through <mark4>time</mark4><br>
alive a little bit on this planet. Hands shoot up . . . opinions . . <mark4>.</mark4><br>
questions . . . What if the sun wept? the moon? Why, in the <mark4>face</mark4><br>
of those open faces, are we so squeamish? Call <mark4>out</mark4><br>
the crippled girl and her only friend the up-for-sale <mark4>foal,</mark4><br>
and let her tootle her woeful pennywhistle <mark4>musics.</mark4><br>
What if some chichi streetwise junkass from the demimonde <br>
gave forth with the story of orphans forced through howling <mark4>storm</mark4><br>
to the workhouse, letting it swing between the <mark3>icy-blue</mark3><br>
quotation marks of cynicism--then? What if   <br>
I wept? What if I simply put the page <mark4>down,</mark4><br>
rocked my head in my own folded elbows, <mark4>forgot</mark4><br>
the rest of it all, and wept? What if I stepped <mark3>into</mark3><br>
the light of that page, a burnished and <mark4>uncompromising</mark4><br>
light, and walked back up to his stone a final <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
just that, no drama, and it was so <mark4>cold,</mark4><br>
and the air was so brittle, metal <mark4>buckled</mark4><br>
out song like a bandsaw, and there, from inside <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
where they'd been lost in shame and sophistry <br>
all these years now, every last one of my <mark4>childhood's</mark4><br>
heartwormed puppydogs found its natural <mark4>voice.</mark4><br>
