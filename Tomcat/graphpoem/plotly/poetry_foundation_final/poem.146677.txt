Title : Little God Origami <br>
Author : Stefi Weisburd <br><br>

The number of corners in the soul <mark4>can't</mark4><br>
compare with the universe's dimensions <mark4>folded</mark4><br>
neatly into <mark4>swans</mark4>, In the <mark4>soul's</mark4><br>
space, one word on a thousand <mark4>pieces</mark4><br>
of paper the size of cookie fortunes <mark4>falls</mark4><br>
from the heavens. At last, the oracular<br>
answer, you cry, pawing at the scraps that twirl<br>
like seed-pod helicopters. Alas, the window<br>
to your soul needs a good scrubbing, so<br>
the letters doodle into indecipherables <mark4>just</mark4><br>
like every answer that has <mark4>rained</mark4><br>
down through history, and you realize, <mark4>in</mark4><br>
your little smog of thought that death<br>
will simply be the cessation of asking, a <mark4>thousand</mark4><br>
cranes unfolding themselves and returning to the <mark4>trees.</mark4><br>
