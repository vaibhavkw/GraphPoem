Title : Blind Curse <br>
Author : Simon J. Ortiz <br><br>

You could drive <mark4>blind</mark4><br>
for those two <mark1>seconds</mark1><br>
and they would be forever. <br>
I think that as a diesel <mark4>truck</mark4><br>
passes us eight miles east of <mark4>Mission.</mark4><br>
Churning through the storm, heedless <br>
of the hill sliding away. <br>
There isn't much use to curse but I do. <br>
Words fly away, tumbling invisibly <br>
toward the unseen point <mark4>where</mark4><br>
the prairie and sky <mark4>meet.</mark4><br>
The road is like that in those <mark1>seconds,</mark1><br>
nothing but the blind white <mark4>side</mark4><br>
of <mark4>creation.</mark4><br>
<br>
You're there <mark4>somewhere,</mark4><br>
a tiny struggling cell. <br>
You just might be <mark4>significant</mark4><br>
but you might not be anything. <br>
Forever is a space of split <mark4>time</mark4><br>
from which to recover after the mass <mark4>passes.</mark4><br>
My curse flies out there <mark1>somewhere,</mark1><br>
and then I send my prayer into the <mark4>wake</mark4><br>
of the diesel truck headed for Sioux <mark4>Falls</mark4><br>
one hundred and eighty miles through the <mark4>storm.</mark4><br>
