Title : The Worship of Nature <br>
Author : John Greenleaf Whittier <br><br>

The harp at Nature's advent <mark3>strung</mark3><br>
Has never ceased to <mark3>play;</mark3><br>
The song the stars of morning <mark3>sung</mark3><br>
Has never died <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
<br>
And prayer is made, and praise is <mark4>given,</mark4><br>
By all things near and <mark3>far;</mark3><br>
The ocean looketh up to <mark4>heaven,</mark4><br>
And mirrors every <mark3>star.</mark3><br>
<br>
Its waves are kneeling on the <mark5>strand,</mark5><br>
As kneels the human <mark3>knee,</mark3><br>
Their white locks bowing to the <mark3>sand,</mark3><br>
The priesthood of the <mark3>sea!</mark3><br>
<br>
They pour their glittering treasures <mark4>forth,</mark4><br>
Their gifts of pearl they <mark4>bring,</mark4><br>
And all the listening hills of <mark4>earth</mark4><br>
Take up the song they <mark3>sing.</mark3><br>
<br>
The green earth sends its incense <mark3>up</mark3><br>
From many a mountain <mark4>shrine;</mark4><br>
From folded leaf and dewy <mark3>cup</mark3><br>
She pours her sacred <mark3>wine.</mark3><br>
<br>
The mists above the morning rills <br>
Rise white as wings of <mark4>prayer;</mark4><br>
The altar-curtains of the <mark4>hills</mark4><br>
Are sunset's purple <mark3>air.</mark3><br>
<br>
The winds with hymns of praise are <mark4>loud,</mark4><br>
Or low with sobs of <mark4>pain,--</mark4><br>
The thunder-organ of the <mark3>cloud,</mark3><br>
The dropping tears of <mark3>rain.</mark3><br>
<br>
With drooping head and branches <mark4>crossed</mark4><br>
The twilight forest <mark4>grieves,</mark4><br>
Or speaks with tongues of <mark4>Pentecost</mark4><br>
From all its sunlit <mark3>leaves.</mark3><br>
<br>
The blue sky is the temple's <mark3>arch,</mark3><br>
Its transept earth and <mark1>air,</mark1><br>
The music of its starry <mark3>march</mark3><br>
The chorus of a <mark1>prayer.</mark1><br>
<br>
So Nature keeps the reverent <mark3>frame</mark3><br>
With which her years <mark4>began,</mark4><br>
And all her signs and voices <mark3>shame</mark3><br>
The prayerless heart of <mark3>man.</mark3><br>
