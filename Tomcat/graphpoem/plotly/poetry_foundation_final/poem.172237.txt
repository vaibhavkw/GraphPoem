Title : The Copper Beech <br>
Author : Daryl Hine <br><br>

It is half past ten in Stonington. <br>
The trees droop apprehensive of the <mark4>heat</mark4><br>
And the sky has turned that pale suspicious <mark4>colour</mark4><br>
That means that it cannot support more <mark4>light.</mark4><br>
Here on the terrace I and a <mark4>companion</mark4><br>
Each pretends to read. The papers <mark3>say</mark3><br>
That it is 90 in New York <mark3>today.</mark3><br>
<br>
Across the street work is going <mark4>forward</mark4><br>
On the abominable house that once I <mark4>fancied,</mark4><br>
Half, might be mine, and which was in fact the <mark4>home</mark4><br>
Of the anonymous couple I used to <mark5>hear</mark5><br>
At night arguing in their unhappy <mark4>bedroom.</mark4><br>
Now they are throwing out another <mark3>wing</mark3><br>
And the site of overlooked love is changed beyond <mark4>recognition.</mark4><br>
<br>
What will the day, what will the summer <mark3>bring?</mark3><br>
Psychic storms or calm productive <mark4>doldrums?</mark4><br>
Our neighbours are no saner than <mark4>ourselves.</mark4><br>
Perhaps it is time to give the Stones a <mark3>ring</mark3><br>
Or to complain of the view from the gallery <mark4>tower</mark4><br>
Falling like a shadow across the calm veranda <br>
Rich with malice and the threat of accidental <mark4>meeting.</mark4><br>
<br>
This is not a house but a <mark4>collection</mark4><br>
(The largest in private hands?) of sacred <mark4>objects,</mark4><br>
A spiritual boutique where <mark4>anyone,</mark4><br>
Even the wrecker who had come to spoil, <br>
May find himself spending more than he <mark4>expected</mark4><br>
On something he cannot quite identify. <br>
Here the little horrors become the household <mark4>gods.</mark4><br>
<br>
For the work of love requires a rule of <mark4>thumb,</mark4><br>
Not no laws in particular but its <mark4>own</mark4><br>
Whose pseudonym, at least here and now, is <mark4>pleasure:</mark4><br>
The morning wasted in work and misquotation,   <br>
A light but leisurely lunch, then <mark4>reading</mark4><br>
Walking or just watching the sun all <mark4>afternoon</mark4><br>
Till, hungry, we draw to evening and ombre. <br>
<br>
Who are we to thank for all of <mark4>this?</mark4><br>
The greatest favours are conferred in <mark4>absence</mark4><br>
Sometimes, as a syllable gives <mark4>comfort</mark4><br>
Dependent on the time and place and <mark4>person.</mark4><br>
When pleasure and reality occur <br>
Is there room for extra <mark4>contemplation</mark4><br>
Or the lyrical promenade? It is enough <br>
<br>
To know (and this is surely <mark1>recognition)</mark1><br>
That the world is spherical and <mark4>perfect.</mark4><br>
Now I wish to introduce the copper beech <br>
We saw on our walk, English and native here as I <mark4>am,</mark4><br>
Whose shade is not the green of <mark1>contemplation</mark1><br>
But the imagination's rich metallic <mark1>colour</mark1><br>
Wherein, under libido, we live.<br>
