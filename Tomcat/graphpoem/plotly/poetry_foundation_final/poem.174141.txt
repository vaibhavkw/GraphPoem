Title : Thoughts <br>
Author : Marjorie Pickthall <br><br>

I gave my thoughts a golden <mark3>peach,</mark3><br>
A silver citron <mark3>tree;</mark3><br>
They clustered dumbly out of <mark3>reach</mark3><br>
And would not sing for <mark3>me.</mark3><br>
<br>
I built my thoughts a roof of <mark3>rush,</mark3><br>
A little byre beside; <br>
They left my music to the <mark3>thrush</mark3><br>
And flew at eveningtide. <br>
<br>
I went my way and would not <mark3>care</mark3><br>
If they should come and <mark3>go;</mark3><br>
A thousand birds seemed up in <mark3>air,</mark3><br>
My thoughts were singing <mark3>so.</mark3><br>
