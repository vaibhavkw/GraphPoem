Title : The Good-Morrow <br>
Author : John Donne <br><br>

I wonder, by my troth, what thou and <mark1>I</mark1><br>
Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till <mark3>then?</mark3><br>
But sucked on country pleasures, childishly? <br>
Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers' <mark3>den?</mark3><br>
'Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies <mark3>be.</mark3><br>
If ever any beauty I did <mark3>see,</mark3><br>
Which I desired, and got, 'twas but a dream of <mark3>thee.</mark3><br>
<br>
And now good-morrow to our waking <mark3>souls,</mark3><br>
Which watch not one another out of <mark4>fear;</mark4><br>
For love, all love of other sights <mark3>controls,</mark3><br>
And makes one little room an <mark4>everywhere.</mark4><br>
Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have <mark4>gone,</mark4><br>
Let maps to other, worlds on worlds have <mark4>shown,</mark4><br>
Let us possess one world, each hath <mark1>one</mark1>, and is <mark4>one.</mark4><br>
<br>
My face in thine eye, thine in mine <mark4>appears,</mark4><br>
And true plain hearts do in the faces <mark3>rest;</mark3><br>
Where can we find two better hemispheres, <br>
Without sharp north, without declining <mark3>west?</mark3><br>
Whatever dies, was not mixed <mark4>equally;</mark4><br>
If our two loves be one, or, thou and <mark1>I</mark1><br>
Love so alike, that none do slacken, none can <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
