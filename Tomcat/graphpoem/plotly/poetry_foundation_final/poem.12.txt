Title : Failure<br>
Author : A. E. Stallings<br><br>

You humble in. It's just as you remember: <br>
The sallow walls, formica counter top, <br>
<br>
The circular argument of time beneath <br>
Fluorescent flickering--doubt, faith, and <mark3>doubt.</mark3><br>
<br>
She knows you've been to see the gilded girl <br>
Who's always promising and walking <mark3>out</mark3><br>
<br>
With someone else. She knew that you'd <mark3>return,</mark3><br>
With nothing in your pockets but your fists. <br>
<br>
Why do you resist? When will you <mark3>learn</mark3><br>
That this is what your weary dreams are <mark3>of--</mark3><br>
<br>
Succumbing to Her unconditional <mark3>love?</mark3><br>
