Title : The Performance <br>
Author : James L. Dickey <br><br>

The last time I saw Donald <mark4>Armstrong</mark4><br>
He was staggering oddly off into the <mark1>sun,</mark1><br>
Going down, off the Philippine <mark4>Islands.</mark4><br>
I let my shovel fall, and put that <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
Above my eyes, and moved some way to one <mark4>side</mark4><br>
That his body might pass through the <mark1>sun,</mark1><br>
<br>
And I saw how well he was <mark4>not</mark4><br>
Standing there on his <mark4>hands,</mark4><br>
On his spindle-shanked forearms <mark4>balanced,</mark4><br>
Unbalanced, with his big feet looming and <mark4>waving</mark4><br>
In the great, untrustworthy <mark3>air</mark3><br>
He flew in each night, when it <mark4>darkened.</mark4><br>
<br>
Dust fanned in scraped puffs from the <mark4>earth</mark4><br>
Between his arms, and blood turned his face inside <mark4>out,</mark4><br>
To demonstrate its suppleness <br>
Of veins, as he perfected his <mark4>role.</mark4><br>
Next day, he toppled his head <mark4>off</mark4><br>
On an island beach to the <mark4>south,</mark4><br>
<br>
And the enemy's two-handed <mark4>sword</mark4><br>
Did not fall from anyone's <mark1>hands</mark1><br>
At that miraculous <mark4>sight,</mark4><br>
As the head rolled over <mark4>upon</mark4><br>
Its wide-eyed face, and <mark4>fell</mark4><br>
Into the inadequate grave <br>
<br>
He had dug for himself, under <mark4>pressure.</mark4><br>
Yet I put my flat hand to my <mark4>eyebrows</mark4><br>
Months later, to see him <mark4>again</mark4><br>
In the sun, when I learned how he <mark4>died,</mark4><br>
And imagined him, <mark3>there,</mark3><br>
Come, judged, before his small <mark4>captors,</mark4><br>
<br>
Doing all his lean tricks to amaze <mark5>them--</mark5><br>
The back somersault, the kip-up-- <br>
And at last, the stand on his <mark1>hands,</mark1><br>
Perfect, with his feet <mark4>together,</mark4><br>
His head down, evenly <mark4>breathing,</mark4><br>
As the sun poured from the sea <br>
<br>
And the headsman broke <mark4>down</mark4><br>
In a blaze of tears, in that <mark3>light</mark3><br>
Of the thin, long human <mark4>frame</mark4><br>
Upside down in its own strange joy, <br>
And, if some other one had not told <mark4>him,</mark4><br>
Would have cut off the <mark4>feet</mark4><br>
<br>
Instead of the <mark4>head,</mark4><br>
And if Armstrong had not presently <mark4>risen</mark4><br>
In kingly, round-shouldered attendance,   <br>
And then knelt down in <mark4>himself</mark4><br>
Beside his hacked, glittering grave, having <mark4>done</mark4><br>
All things in this life that he <mark4>could.</mark4><br>
