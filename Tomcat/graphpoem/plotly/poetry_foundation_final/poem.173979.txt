Title : Song in the Songless <br>
Author : George Meredith <br><br>

They have no song, the sedges <mark3>dry,</mark3><br>
And still they <mark1>sing.</mark1><br>
It is within my breast they <mark1>sing,</mark1><br>
As I pass <mark3>by.</mark3><br>
Within my breast they touch a <mark3>string,</mark3><br>
They wake a <mark3>sigh.</mark3><br>
There is but sound of sedges <mark1>dry;</mark1><br>
In me they <mark1>sing.</mark1><br>
