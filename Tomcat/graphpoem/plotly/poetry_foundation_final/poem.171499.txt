Title : At the Bomb Testing Site <br>
Author : William E. Stafford <br><br>

At noon in the desert a panting <mark4>lizard</mark4><br>
waited for history, its elbows <mark4>tense,</mark4><br>
watching the curve of a particular <mark4>road</mark4><br>
as if something might <mark4>happen.</mark4><br>
<br>
It was looking at something farther off   <br>
than people could see, an important <mark4>scene</mark4><br>
acted in stone for little <mark4>selves</mark4><br>
at the flute end of <mark4>consequences.</mark4><br>
<br>
There was just a continent without much on <mark4>it</mark4><br>
under a sky that never cared <mark4>less.</mark4><br>
Ready for a change, the elbows <mark4>waited.</mark4><br>
The hands gripped hard on the <mark4>desert.</mark4><br>
