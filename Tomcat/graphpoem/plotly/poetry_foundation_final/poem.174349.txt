Title : The Shooting of Dan McGrew <br>
Author : Robert W. Service <br><br>

A bunch of the boys were whooping it up in the Malamute <mark3>saloon;</mark3><br>
The kid that handles the music-box was hitting a jag-time <mark3>tune;</mark3><br>
Back of the bar, in a solo game, sat Dangerous Dan <mark3>McGrew,</mark3><br>
And watching his luck was his light-o'-love, the lady that's known as <mark3>Lou.</mark3><br>
<br>
When out of the night, which was fifty below, and into the din and the <mark3>glare,</mark3><br>
There stumbled a miner fresh from the creeks, dog-dirty, and loaded for <mark3>bear.</mark3><br>
He looked like a man with a foot in the grave and scarcely the strength of a <mark3>louse,</mark3><br>
Yet he tilted a poke of dust on the bar, and he called for drinks for the <mark3>house.</mark3><br>
There was none could place the stranger's face, though we searched ourselves for a <mark3>clue;</mark3><br>
But we drank his health, and the last to drink was Dangerous Dan <mark1>McGrew.</mark1><br>
<br>
There's men that somehow just grip your eyes, and hold them hard like a <mark3>spell;</mark3><br>
And such was he, and he looked to me like a man who had lived in <mark3>hell;</mark3><br>
With a face most hair, and the dreary stare of a dog whose day is <mark4>done,</mark4><br>
As he watered the green stuff in his glass, and the drops fell one by <mark3>one.</mark3><br>
Then I got to figgering who he was, and wondering what he'd <mark3>do,</mark3><br>
And I turned my head -- and there watching him was the lady that's known as <mark1>Lou.</mark1><br>
<br>
His eyes went rubbering round the room, and he seemed in a kind of <mark3>daze,</mark3><br>
Till at last that old piano fell in the way of his wandering <mark3>gaze.</mark3><br>
The rag-time kid was having a drink; there was no one else on the <mark4>stool,</mark4><br>
So the stranger stumbles across the room, and flops down there like a <mark3>fool.</mark3><br>
In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat, and I saw him <mark3>sway;</mark3><br>
Then he clutched the keys with his talon hands -- my God! but that man could <mark3>play.</mark3><br>
<br>
Were you ever out in the Great Alone, when the moon was awful <mark4>clear,</mark4><br>
And the icy mountains hemmed you in with a silence you most could <mark4>hear;</mark4><br>
With only the howl of a timber wolf, and you camped there in the <mark3>cold,</mark3><br>
A half-dead thing in a stark, dead <mark4>world</mark4>, clean mad for the muck called <mark3>gold;</mark3><br>
While high overhead, green, yellow and red, the North Lights swept in bars? <mark4>--</mark4><br>
Then you've a hunch what the music meant. . . hunger and night and the <mark3>stars.</mark3><br>
<br>
And hunger not of the belly kind, that's banished with bacon and <mark4>beans,</mark4><br>
But the gnawing hunger of lonely men for a home and all that it <mark3>means;</mark3><br>
For a fireside far from the cares that are, four walls and a roof <mark3>above;</mark3><br>
But oh! so cramful of cosy joy, and crowned with a woman's love <mark3>--</mark3><br>
A woman dearer than all the world, and true as Heaven is true <mark3>--</mark3><br>
(God! how ghastly she looks through her rouge, -- the lady that's known as <mark1>Lou.)</mark1><br>
<br>
Then on a sudden the music changed, so soft that you scarce could <mark1>hear;</mark1><br>
But you felt that your life had been looted clean of all that it once held <mark4>dear;</mark4><br>
That someone had stolen the woman you loved; that her love was a devil's <mark3>lie;</mark3><br>
That your guts were gone, and the best for you was to crawl away and <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
'Twas the crowning cry of a heart's despair, and it thrilled you through and through <mark3>--</mark3><br>
"I guess I'll make it a spread misere", said Dangerous Dan <mark1>McGrew.</mark1><br>
<br>
The music almost died away ... then it burst like a pent-up <mark4>flood;</mark4><br>
And it seemed to say, "Repay, repay," and my eyes were blind with <mark3>blood.</mark3><br>
The thought came back of an ancient wrong, and it stung like a frozen <mark3>lash,</mark3><br>
And the lust awoke to kill, to kill ... then the music stopped with a <mark3>crash,</mark3><br>
And the stranger turned, and his eyes they burned in a most peculiar <mark3>way;</mark3><br>
In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat, and I saw him <mark1>sway;</mark1><br>
Then his lips went in in a kind of grin, and he spoke, and his voice was <mark4>calm,</mark4><br>
And "Boys," says he, "you don't know me, and none of you care a <mark4>damn;</mark4><br>
But I want to state, and my words are straight, and I'll bet my poke they're <mark1>true,</mark1><br>
That one of you is a hound of hell. . .and that one is Dan <mark1>McGrew."</mark1><br>
<br>
Then I ducked my head, and the lights went out, and two guns blazed in the <mark3>dark,</mark3><br>
And a woman screamed, and the lights went up, and two men lay stiff and <mark3>stark.</mark3><br>
Pitched on his head, and pumped full of lead, was Dangerous Dan <mark1>McGrew,</mark1><br>
While the man from the creeks lay clutched to the breast of the lady that's known as <mark1>Lou.</mark1><br>
<br>
These are the simple facts of the case, and I guess I ought to <mark3>know.</mark3><br>
They say that the stranger was crazed with "hooch," and I'm not denying it's <mark3>so.</mark3><br>
I'm not so wise as the lawyer guys, but strictly between us two <mark3>--</mark3><br>
The woman that kissed him and -- pinched his poke -- was the lady that's known as <mark1>Lou.</mark1><br>
