Title : A New Reality Is Better Than a New Movie! <br>
Author : Amiri Baraka <br><br>

How will it go, crumbling earthquake, towering inferno, juggernaut, volcano, smashup, <br>
in reality, other than the feverish nearreal fantasy of the capitalist flunky film <mark4>hacks</mark4><br>
tho they sense its reality breathing a quake inferno scar on their throat even snorts <mark1>of</mark1><br>
100% pure cocaine cant cancel the cold cut of impending death to this <mark4>society</mark4>, On all <mark4>the</mark4><br>
screens of america, the joint blows up every hour and a half for two dollars an fifty <mark4>cents.</mark4><br>
They have taken the niggers out to lunch, for a minute, made us partners nigger Charlie) <mark2>or</mark2><br>
surrogates (boss nigger) for their horror. But just as superafrikan mobutu cannot leop <br>
ardskinhat <mark4>his</mark4><br>
way out of responsibility for lumumba's death, nor even with his incredible <mark4>billions</mark4><br>
<br>
cannot even save his pale ho's titties in the crushing weight <mark1>of</mark1><br>
things as they really <mark2>are.</mark2><br>
How will it go, does it reach you, getting up, sitting on the <mark4>side</mark4><br>
of the bed, getting ready to go to work.   Hypnotized by the ma- <br>
chine, and the cement floor, the jungle treachery <mark1>of</mark1><br>
<br>
to survive with no money in a money world, of making the <mark4>boss</mark4><br>
100,000 for every 200 <br>
<br>
you get, and then having his brother get you for the rent, and <mark4>if</mark4><br>
you want to buy the <mark3>car</mark3><br>
<br>
helped build, your downpayment paid for it, the rest goes to buy   <br>
his old lady a foam <br>
<br>
rhinestone set of boobies for special occasions when <mark3>kissinger</mark3><br>
drunkenly fumbles with her blouse, forgetting <mark4>himself.</mark4><br>
If you don't like it, what you gonna do about it. That was <mark1>the</mark1><br>
question we asked each <br>
other, <mark4>&</mark4><br>
still right regularly need to ask. You don't like it? Whatcha   <br>
gonna do, about <mark4>it??</mark4><br>
The real terror of nature is humanity enraged, the <mark3>true</mark3><br>
technicolor spectacle <mark4>that</mark4><br>
<br>
cant record. They cant even show you how you look when <mark3>you</mark3><br>
go to work, or when <mark1>you</mark1><br>
    come back. <br>
They cant even show you thinking or demanding the new so- <br>
cialist reality, its the <mark4>ultimate</mark4><br>
<br>
wave. When all over the planet, men and <mark4>women</mark4>, with heat <mark4>in</mark4><br>
their hands, demand <mark1>that</mark1><br>
<br>
be planned to include the lives and self determination of all <mark1>the</mark1><br>
people ever to <mark4>live</mark4>, That is the scalding scenario with a cast <mark1>of</mark1><br>
just under two billion that they dare not even whisper. Its <mark4>called,</mark4><br>
"We Want It All . . . The Whole <mark4>World!"</mark4><br>
