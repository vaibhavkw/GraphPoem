Title : Sonnet 106: When in the chronicle of wasted time <br>
Author : William Shakespeare <br><br>

When in the chronicle of wasted <mark3>time</mark3><br>
I see descriptions of the fairest wights, <br>
And beauty making beautiful old <mark3>rhyme</mark3><br>
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights, <br>
Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best, <br>
Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of <mark3>brow,</mark3><br>
I see their antique pen would have <mark4>express'd</mark4><br>
Even such a beauty as you master <mark3>now.</mark3><br>
So all their praises are but <mark4>prophecies</mark4><br>
Of this our time, all you prefiguring; <br>
And, for they look'd but with divining <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
They had not skill enough your worth to sing: <br>
For we, which now behold these present <mark4>days,</mark4><br>
Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to <mark3>praise.</mark3><br>
