Title : Easter, 1916 <br>
Author : William Butler Yeats <br><br>

I have met them at close of <mark3>day</mark3><br>
Coming with vivid <mark4>faces</mark4><br>
From counter or desk among <mark3>grey</mark3><br>
Eighteenth-century <mark4>houses.</mark4><br>
I have passed with a nod of the <mark3>head</mark3><br>
Or polite meaningless <mark4>words,</mark4><br>
Or have lingered awhile and <mark3>said</mark3><br>
Polite meaningless <mark1>words,</mark1><br>
And thought before I had <mark4>done</mark4><br>
Of a mocking tale or a <mark4>gibe</mark4><br>
To please a <mark4>companion</mark4><br>
Around the fire at the <mark4>club,</mark4><br>
Being certain that they and I   <br>
But lived where motley is <mark4>worn:</mark4><br>
All changed, changed <mark4>utterly:</mark4><br>
A terrible beauty is <mark3>born.</mark3><br>
<br>
That woman's days were <mark4>spent</mark4><br>
In ignorant <mark3>good-will,</mark3><br>
Her nights in <mark4>argument</mark4><br>
Until her voice grew <mark3>shrill.</mark3><br>
What voice more sweet than <mark4>hers</mark4><br>
When, young and <mark4>beautiful,</mark4><br>
She rode to harriers? <br>
This man had kept a <mark4>school</mark4><br>
And rode our winged <mark3>horse;</mark3><br>
This other his helper and <mark4>friend</mark4><br>
Was coming into his <mark3>force;</mark3><br>
He might have won fame in the <mark3>end,</mark3><br>
So sensitive his nature <mark4>seemed,</mark4><br>
So daring and sweet his <mark4>thought.</mark4><br>
This other man I had <mark3>dreamed</mark3><br>
A drunken, vainglorious <mark4>lout.</mark4><br>
He had done most bitter <mark3>wrong</mark3><br>
To some who are near my <mark4>heart,</mark4><br>
Yet I number him in the <mark3>song;</mark3><br>
He, too, has resigned his <mark3>part</mark3><br>
In the casual <mark4>comedy;</mark4><br>
He, too, has been changed in his <mark4>turn,</mark4><br>
Transformed <mark1>utterly:</mark1><br>
A terrible beauty is <mark1>born.</mark1><br>
<br>
Hearts with one purpose <mark4>alone</mark4><br>
Through summer and winter <mark5>seem</mark5><br>
Enchanted to a <mark3>stone</mark3><br>
To trouble the living <mark3>stream.</mark3><br>
The horse that comes from the <mark4>road,</mark4><br>
The rider, the birds that <mark3>range</mark3><br>
From cloud to tumbling <mark4>cloud,</mark4><br>
Minute by minute they <mark3>change;</mark3><br>
A shadow of cloud on the <mark1>stream</mark1><br>
Changes minute by <mark4>minute;</mark4><br>
A horse-hoof slides on the <mark4>brim,</mark4><br>
And a horse plashes within <mark4>it;</mark4><br>
The long-legged moor-hens <mark3>dive,</mark3><br>
And hens to moor-cocks <mark4>call;</mark4><br>
Minute by minute they <mark3>live:</mark3><br>
The stone's in the midst of <mark3>all.</mark3><br>
<br>
Too long a <mark4>sacrifice</mark4><br>
Can make a stone of the <mark1>heart.</mark1><br>
O when may it <mark4>suffice?</mark4><br>
That is Heaven's <mark1>part</mark1>, our <mark1>part</mark1><br>
To murmur name upon <mark4>name,</mark4><br>
As a mother names her <mark4>child</mark4><br>
When sleep at last has <mark4>come</mark4><br>
On limbs that had run <mark3>wild.</mark3><br>
What is it but <mark4>nightfall?</mark4><br>
No, no, not night but <mark4>death;</mark4><br>
Was it needless death after <mark1>all?</mark1><br>
For England may keep <mark4>faith</mark4><br>
For all that is done and <mark1>said.</mark1><br>
We know their dream; enough <br>
To know they dreamed and are <mark3>dead;</mark3><br>
And what if excess of <mark4>love</mark4><br>
Bewildered them till they <mark4>died?</mark4><br>
I write it out in a <mark4>verse--</mark4><br>
MacDonagh and <mark3>MacBride</mark3><br>
And Connolly and <mark3>Pearse</mark3><br>
Now and in time to <mark4>be,</mark4><br>
Wherever green is <mark1>worn,</mark1><br>
Are changed, changed <mark1>utterly:</mark1><br>
A terrible beauty is <mark1>born.</mark1><br>
