Title : Octaves <br>
Author : Edwin Arlington Robinson <br><br>

<br>
We thrill too strangely at the master's <mark4>touch;</mark4><br>
We shrink too sadly from the larger <mark3>self</mark3><br>
Which for its own completeness agitates<br>
And undetermines us; we do not <mark4>feel?</mark4><br>
We dare not feel it yet?the splendid <mark4>shame</mark4><br>
Of uncreated failure; we <mark4>forget,</mark4><br>
The while we groan, that God's <mark4>accomplishment</mark4><br>
Is always and unfailingly at <mark4>hand.</mark4><br>
<br>
Tumultuously void of a clean <mark4>scheme</mark4><br>
Whereon to build, whereof to <mark4>formulate,</mark4><br>
The legion life that riots in <mark4>mankind</mark4><br>
Goes ever plunging upward, up and <mark4>down,</mark4><br>
Most like some crazy regiment at <mark4>arms,</mark4><br>
Undisciplined of aught but <mark4>Ignorance,</mark4><br>
And ever led resourcelessly <mark4>along</mark4><br>
To brainless carnage by drunk trumpeters.<br>
To me the groaning of <mark4>world-worshippers</mark4><br>
<br>
Rings like a lonely music played in <mark4>hell</mark4><br>
By one with art enough to cleave the <mark4>walls</mark4><br>
Of heaven with his cadence, but <mark4>without</mark4><br>
The wisdom or the will to <mark4>comprehend</mark4><br>
The strangeness of his own <mark4>perversity,</mark4><br>
And all without the courage to <mark3>deny</mark3><br>
The profit and the pride of his <mark4>defeat.</mark4><br>
While we are drilled in error, we are <mark4>lost</mark4><br>
Alike to truth and usefulness. We <mark4>think</mark4><br>
<br>
We are great warriors now, and we can <mark4>brag</mark4><br>
Like Titans; but the world is growing <mark4>young,</mark4><br>
And we, the fools of time, are growing with <mark4>it:?</mark4><br>
We do not fight to-day, we only <mark3>die;</mark3><br>
We are too proud of death, and too <mark4>ashamed</mark4><br>
Of God, to know enough to be <mark4>alive.</mark4><br>
There is one battle-field whereon we <mark4>fall</mark4><br>
Triumphant and unconquered; but, <mark4>alas!</mark4><br>
We are too fleshly fearful of <mark4>ourselves</mark4><br>
<br>
To fight there till our days are whirled and <mark4>blurred</mark4><br>
By sorrow, and the ministering <mark4>wheels</mark4><br>
Of anguish take us eastward, where the <mark4>clouds</mark4><br>
Of human gloom are lost against the <mark3>gleam</mark3><br>
That shines on Thought's impenetrable <mark4>mail.</mark4><br>
When we shall hear no more the <mark4>cradle-songs</mark4><br>
Of ages?when the timeless hymns of <mark4>Love</mark4><br>
Defeat them and outsound them?we shall <mark1>know</mark1><br>
The rapture of that large release which <mark4>all</mark4><br>
<br>
Right science comprehends; and we shall <mark4>read,</mark4><br>
With unoppressed and unoffended <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
That record of All-Soul whereon God <mark4>writes</mark4><br>
In everlasting runes the truth of <mark4>Him.</mark4><br>
The guerdon of new childhood is <mark4>repose:?</mark4><br>
Once he has read the primer of right <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
A man may claim between two smithy <mark4>strokes</mark4><br>
Beatitude enough to <mark4>realize</mark4><br>
God's parallel completeness in the <mark4>vague</mark4><br>
<br>
And incommensurable <mark4>excellence</mark4><br>
That equitably uncreates <mark3>itself</mark3><br>
And makes a whirlwind of the <mark4>Universe.</mark4><br>
There is no loneliness:?no matter <mark5>where</mark5><br>
We go, nor whence we come, nor what good <mark4>friends</mark4><br>
Forsake us in the seeming, we are <mark1>all</mark1><br>
At one with a complete <mark5>companionship;</mark5><br>
And though forlornly joyless be the <mark4>ways</mark4><br>
We travel, the compensate <mark4>spirit-gleams</mark4><br>
<br>
Of Wisdom shaft the darkness here and <mark3>there,</mark3><br>
Like scattered lamps in unfrequented <mark4>streets.</mark4><br>
When one that you and I had all but <mark4>sworn</mark4><br>
To be the purest thing God ever <mark4>made</mark4><br>
Bewilders us until at last it <mark3>seems</mark3><br>
An angel has come back restigmatized,?<br>
Faith wavers, and we wonder what there <mark4>is</mark4><br>
On earth to make us faithful any <mark4>more,</mark4><br>
But never are quite wise enough to <mark1>know</mark1><br>
<br>
The wisdom that is in that <mark4>wonderment.</mark4><br>
Where does a dead man go??The dead man <mark4>dies;</mark4><br>
But the free life that would no longer <mark4>feed</mark4><br>
On fagots of outburned and shattered flesh<br>
Wakes to a thrilled invisible <mark4>advance,</mark4><br>
Unchained (or fettered else) of <mark4>memory;</mark4><br>
And when the dead man goes it seems to <mark1>me</mark1><br>
'T were better for us all to do away<br>
With weeping, and be glad that he is <mark4>gone.</mark4><br>
<br>
So through the dusk of dead, blank-legended,<br>
And unremunerative years we <mark4>search</mark4><br>
To get where life begins, and still we <mark4>groan</mark4><br>
Because we do not find the living <mark4>spark</mark4><br>
Where no spark ever was; and thus we <mark1>die,</mark1><br>
Still searching, like poor old <mark4>astronomers</mark4><br>
Who totter off to bed and go to <mark4>sleep,</mark4><br>
To dream of untriangulated <mark4>stars.</mark4><br>
With conscious eyes not yet sincere <mark4>enough</mark4><br>
<br>
To pierce the glimmered cloud that <mark4>fluctuates</mark4><br>
Between me and the glorifying <mark4>light</mark4><br>
That screens itself with knowledge, I <mark4>discern</mark4><br>
The searching rays of wisdom that reach <mark1>through</mark1><br>
The mist of shame's infirm <mark4>credulity,</mark4><br>
And infinitely wonder if hard <mark4>words</mark4><br>
Like mine have any message for the <mark4>dead.</mark4><br>
I grant you friendship is a royal <mark4>thing,</mark4><br>
But none shall ever know that <mark4>royalty</mark4><br>
<br>
For what it is till he has <mark4>realized</mark4><br>
His best friend in himself. 'T is then, <mark4>perforce,</mark4><br>
That man's unfettered faith indemnifies<br>
Of its own conscious freedom the old <mark1>shame,</mark1><br>
And love's revealed infinitude <mark4>supplants</mark4><br>
Of its own wealth and wisdom the old <mark4>scorn.</mark4><br>
Though the sick beast infect us, we are <mark4>fraught</mark4><br>
Forever with indissoluble Truth,<br>
Wherein redress reveals itself <mark4>divine,</mark4><br>
<br>
Transitional, transcendent. Grief and <mark4>loss,</mark4><br>
Disease and desolation, are the <mark4>dreams</mark4><br>
Of wasted excellence; and every <mark4>dream</mark4><br>
Has in it something of an ageless <mark4>fact</mark4><br>
That flouts deformity and laughs at <mark4>years.</mark4><br>
We lack the courage to be where we <mark4>are:?</mark4><br>
We love too much to travel on old <mark4>roads,</mark4><br>
To triumph on old fields; we love too <mark4>much</mark4><br>
To consecrate the magic of dead <mark4>things,</mark4><br>
<br>
And yieldingly to linger by long <mark1>walls</mark1><br>
Of ruin, where the ruinous <mark4>moonlight</mark4><br>
That sheds a lying glory on old <mark4>stones</mark4><br>
Befriends us with a wizard's <mark4>enmity.</mark4><br>
Something as one with eyes that look <mark3>below</mark3><br>
The battle-smoke to glimpse the foeman's <mark4>charge,</mark4><br>
We through the dust of downward years may <mark4>scan</mark4><br>
The onslaught that awaits this idiot <mark4>world</mark4><br>
Where blood pays blood for nothing, and where <mark4>life</mark4><br>
<br>
Pays life to <mark4>madness</mark4>, till at last the <mark4>ports</mark4><br>
Of gilded helplessness be battered <mark1>through</mark1><br>
By the still crash of salvatory <mark4>steel.</mark4><br>
To you that sit with Sorrow like chained <mark4>slaves,</mark4><br>
And wonder if the night will ever <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
I would say this: The night will never <mark1>come,</mark1><br>
And sorrow is not <mark4>always</mark4>, But my <mark1>words</mark1><br>
Are not <mark1>enough</mark1>, your eyes are not <mark1>enough;</mark1><br>
The soul itself must insulate the <mark3>Real,</mark3><br>
<br>
Or ever you do cherish in this <mark1>life?</mark1><br>
In this life or in any <mark5>life?repose.</mark5><br>
Like a white wall whereon forever <mark4>breaks</mark4><br>
Unsatisfied the tumult of green <mark4>seas,</mark4><br>
Man's unconjectured godliness <mark4>rebukes</mark4><br>
With its imperial silence the lost <mark4>waves</mark4><br>
Of insufficient grief. This mortal <mark4>surge</mark4><br>
That beats against us now is nothing <mark4>else</mark4><br>
Than plangent <mark4>ignorance</mark4>, Truth neither <mark4>shakes</mark4><br>
<br>
Nor wavers; but the world shakes, and we <mark4>shriek.</mark4><br>
Nor jewelled phrase nor mere mellifluous <mark4>rhyme</mark4><br>
Reverberates aright, or ever <mark4>shall,</mark4><br>
One cadence of that infinite <mark4>plain-song</mark4><br>
Which is itself all music. Stronger <mark4>notes</mark4><br>
Than any that have ever touched the <mark1>world</mark1><br>
Must ring to tell it?ring like <mark4>hammer-blows,</mark4><br>
Right-echoed of a chime <mark4>primordial,</mark4><br>
On anvils, in the gleaming of God's <mark4>forge.</mark4><br>
<br>
The prophet of dead words defeats <mark4>himself:</mark4><br>
Whoever would acknowledge and <mark4>include</mark4><br>
The foregleam and the glory of the <mark1>real,</mark1><br>
Must work with something else than pen and <mark4>ink</mark4><br>
And painful preparation: he must <mark4>work</mark4><br>
With unseen implements that have no <mark4>names,</mark4><br>
And he must win withal, to do that <mark1>work,</mark1><br>
Good fortitude, clean wisdom, and strong <mark4>skill.</mark4><br>
To curse the chilled insistence of the <mark4>dawn</mark4><br>
<br>
Because the free gleam lingers; to <mark4>defraud</mark4><br>
The constant opportunity that <mark4>lives</mark4><br>
Unchallenged in all sorrow; to <mark1>forget</mark1><br>
For this large prodigality of <mark4>gold</mark4><br>
That larger generosity of <mark1>thought,?</mark1><br>
These are the fleshly clogs of human <mark4>greed,</mark4><br>
The fundamental blunders of <mark1>mankind.</mark1><br>
Forebodings are the fiends of Recreance;<br>
The master of the moment, the clean <mark4>seer</mark4><br>
<br>
Of <mark3>ages</mark3>, too securely scans what <mark1>is,</mark1><br>
Ever to be appalled at what is <mark4>not;</mark4><br>
He sees beyond the groaning borough <mark4>lines</mark4><br>
Of Hell, God's highways gleaming, and he <mark4>knows</mark4><br>
That Love's complete communion is the <mark4>end</mark4><br>
Of anguish to the liberated <mark4>man.</mark4><br>
Here by the windy docks I stand <mark4>alone,</mark4><br>
But yet companioned. There the vessel <mark3>goes,</mark3><br>
And there my friend goes with it; but the <mark4>wake</mark4><br>
<br>
That melts and ebbs between that friend and <mark1>me</mark1><br>
Love's earnest is of Life's <mark4>all-purposeful</mark4><br>
And all-triumphant sailing, when the <mark4>ships</mark4><br>
Of Wisdom loose their fretful chains and <mark4>swing</mark4><br>
Forever from the crumbled wharves of <mark3>Time.</mark3><br>
