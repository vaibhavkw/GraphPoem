Title : The Wreck of the Hesperus <br>
Author : Henry Wadsworth Longfellow <br><br>

It was the schooner <mark1>Hesperus,</mark1><br>
That sailed the wintry <mark2>sea;</mark2><br>
And the skipper had taken his little <mark4>daughter,</mark4><br>
To bear him <mark3>company.</mark3><br>
<br>
Blue were her eyes as the <mark4>fairy-flax,</mark4><br>
Her cheeks like the dawn of <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
And her bosom white as the hawthorn <mark4>buds,</mark4><br>
That ope in the month of <mark3>May.</mark3><br>
<br>
The skipper he stood beside the helm, <br>
His pipe was in his <mark3>mouth,</mark3><br>
And he watched how the veering flaw did <mark3>blow</mark3><br>
The smoke now West, now <mark3>South.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then up and spake an old <mark4>Sailor,</mark4><br>
Had sailed to the Spanish <mark4>Main,</mark4><br>
"I pray thee, put into yonder <mark4>port,</mark4><br>
For I fear a <mark4>hurricane.</mark4><br>
<br>
"Last night, the moon had a golden <mark1>ring,</mark1><br>
And to-night no moon we <mark2>see!"</mark2><br>
The skipper, he blew a whiff from his pipe, <br>
And a scornful laugh laughed <mark3>he.</mark3><br>
<br>
Colder and louder blew the <mark4>wind,</mark4><br>
A gale from the <mark4>Northeast,</mark4><br>
The snow fell hissing in the <mark4>brine,</mark4><br>
And the billows frothed like <mark3>yeast.</mark3><br>
<br>
Down came the storm, and smote amain <br>
The vessel in its <mark4>strength;</mark4><br>
She shuddered and <mark4>paused</mark4>, like a frighted <mark4>steed,</mark4><br>
Then leaped her cable's <mark3>length.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Come hither! come hither! my little <mark1>daughter,</mark1><br>
And do not tremble <mark3>so;</mark3><br>
For I can weather the roughest <mark4>gale</mark4><br>
That ever wind did <mark1>blow."</mark1><br>
<br>
He wrapped her warm in his seaman's <mark4>coat</mark4><br>
Against the stinging <mark4>blast;</mark4><br>
He cut a rope from a broken <mark4>spar,</mark4><br>
And bound her to the <mark3>mast.</mark3><br>
<br>
"O father! I hear the church-bells <mark1>ring,</mark1><br>
Oh say, what may it <mark3>be?"</mark3><br>
"'T is a fog-bell on a rock-bound coast!" <mark4>--</mark4><br>
And he steered for the open <mark1>sea.</mark1><br>
<br>
"O father! I hear the sound of <mark4>guns,</mark4><br>
Oh say, what may it <mark1>be?"</mark1><br>
"Some ship in distress, that cannot <mark4>live</mark4><br>
In such an angry <mark1>sea!"</mark1><br>
<br>
"O father! I see a gleaming <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
Oh say, what may it <mark1>be?"</mark1><br>
But the father answered never a <mark4>word,</mark4><br>
A frozen corpse was <mark1>he.</mark1><br>
<br>
Lashed to the helm, all stiff and <mark4>stark,</mark4><br>
With his face turned to the <mark4>skies,</mark4><br>
The lantern gleamed through the gleaming <mark3>snow</mark3><br>
On his fixed and glassy <mark3>eyes.</mark3><br>
<br>
Then the maiden clasped her hands and <mark4>prayed</mark4><br>
That saved she might <mark1>be;</mark1><br>
And she thought of Christ, who stilled the <mark4>wave</mark4><br>
On the Lake of <mark3>Galilee.</mark3><br>
<br>
And fast through the midnight dark and drear, <br>
Through the whistling sleet and <mark1>snow,</mark1><br>
Like a sheeted <mark4>ghost</mark4>, the vessel <mark4>swept</mark4><br>
Tow'rds the reef of Norman's <mark3>Woe.</mark3><br>
<br>
And ever the fitful gusts <mark4>between</mark4><br>
A sound came from the <mark4>land;</mark4><br>
It was the sound of the trampling surf <br>
On the rocks and the hard <mark3>sea-sand.</mark3><br>
<br>
The breakers were right beneath her <mark4>bows,</mark4><br>
She drifted a dreary <mark4>wreck,</mark4><br>
And a whooping billow swept the crew <br>
Like icicles from her <mark3>deck.</mark3><br>
<br>
She struck where the white and fleecy <mark4>waves</mark4><br>
Looked soft as carded <mark4>wool,</mark4><br>
But the cruel rocks, they gored her <mark4>side</mark4><br>
Like the horns of an angry <mark3>bull.</mark3><br>
<br>
Her rattling shrouds, all sheathed in <mark4>ice,</mark4><br>
With the masts went by the <mark4>board;</mark4><br>
Like a vessel of glass, she stove and <mark4>sank,</mark4><br>
Ho! ho! the breakers <mark3>roared!</mark3><br>
<br>
At daybreak, on the bleak <mark5>sea-beach,</mark5><br>
A fisherman stood <mark4>aghast,</mark4><br>
To see the form of a maiden <mark4>fair,</mark4><br>
Lashed close to a drifting <mark1>mast.</mark1><br>
<br>
The salt sea was frozen on her <mark4>breast,</mark4><br>
The salt tears in her <mark1>eyes;</mark1><br>
And he saw her hair, like the brown <mark4>sea-weed,</mark4><br>
On the billows fall and <mark3>rise.</mark3><br>
<br>
Such was the wreck of the <mark1>Hesperus,</mark1><br>
In the midnight and the <mark1>snow!</mark1><br>
Christ save us all from a death like <mark4>this,</mark4><br>
On the reef of Norman's <mark1>Woe!</mark1><br>
