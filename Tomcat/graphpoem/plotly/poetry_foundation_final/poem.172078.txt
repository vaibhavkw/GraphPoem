Title : Constructive <br>
Author : Heather McHugh <br><br>

You take a rock, your hand is <mark4>hard.</mark4><br>
You raise your eyes, and there's a <mark5>pair</mark5><br>
of small beloveds, caught in <mark5>pails.</mark5><br>
The monocle and eyepatch <mark4>correspond.</mark4><br>
<br>
You take a glove, your hand is <mark4>soft.</mark4><br>
The ocean floor was <mark3>done</mark3><br>
in lizardskin. Around a log or snag   <br>
the surface currents <mark3>run</mark3><br>
<br>
like lumber about a <mark4>knot</mark4>, A <mark4>boat</mark4><br>
is bent to sea--we favor the <mark4>medium</mark4><br>
we're in, our <mark4>shape's</mark4><br>
around us. It takes <mark4>time.</mark4><br>
<br>
At night, the bed alive, <mark4>what</mark4><br>
teller of truth could tell <br>
the two apart? Lover, <mark4>beloved,</mark4><br>
hope is <mark3>command</mark3>, Your <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
<br>
is given, when you take a <mark1>hand.</mark1><br>
