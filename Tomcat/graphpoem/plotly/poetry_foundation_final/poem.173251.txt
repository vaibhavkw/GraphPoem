Title : The Pains of Sleep <br>
Author : Samuel Taylor Coleridge <br><br>

Ere on my bed my limbs I <mark3>lay,</mark3><br>
It hath not been my use to <mark3>pray</mark3><br>
With moving lips or bended <mark3>knees;</mark3><br>
But silently, by slow <mark3>degrees,</mark3><br>
My spirit I to Love <mark4>compose,</mark4><br>
In humble trust mine eye-lids <mark3>close,</mark3><br>
With reverential <mark4>resignation</mark4><br>
No wish conceived, no thought exprest,<br>
Only a sense of supplication;<br>
A sense o'er all my soul imprest<br>
That I am weak, yet not unblest,<br>
Since in me, round me, every <mark4>where</mark4><br>
Eternal strength and Wisdom <mark4>are.</mark4><br>
<br>
But yester-night I prayed <mark3>aloud</mark3><br>
In anguish and in <mark4>agony,</mark4><br>
Up-starting from the fiendish <mark3>crowd</mark3><br>
Of shapes and thoughts that tortured <mark1>me:</mark1><br>
A lurid light, a trampling <mark3>throng,</mark3><br>
Sense of intolerable <mark3>wrong,</mark3><br>
And whom I scorned, those only <mark3>strong!</mark3><br>
Thirst of revenge, the powerless <mark3>will</mark3><br>
Still baffled, and yet burning <mark3>still!</mark3><br>
Desire with loathing strangely <mark3>mixed</mark3><br>
On wild or hateful objects <mark3>fixed.</mark3><br>
Fantastic passions! maddening <mark4>brawl!</mark4><br>
And shame and terror over <mark3>all!</mark3><br>
Deeds to be hid which were not <mark4>hid,</mark4><br>
Which all confused I could not <mark3>know</mark3><br>
Whether I <mark4>suffered</mark4>, or I <mark3>did:</mark3><br>
For all seemed guilt, remorse or <mark3>woe,</mark3><br>
My own or others still the <mark3>same</mark3><br>
Life-stifling fear, soul-stifling <mark3>shame.</mark3><br>
<br>
So two nights passed: the night's <mark3>dismay</mark3><br>
Saddened and stunned the coming <mark3>day.</mark3><br>
Sleep, the wide blessing, seemed to <mark1>me</mark1><br>
Distemper's worst <mark4>calamity.</mark4><br>
The third night, when my own loud <mark4>scream</mark4><br>
Had waked me from the fiendish <mark3>dream,</mark3><br>
O'ercome with sufferings strange and <mark4>wild,</mark4><br>
I wept as I had been a <mark3>child;</mark3><br>
And having thus by tears <mark4>subdued</mark4><br>
My anguish to a milder <mark3>mood,</mark3><br>
Such punishments, I said, were <mark3>due</mark3><br>
To natures deepliest stained with <mark4>sin,?</mark4><br>
For aye entempesting <mark3>anew</mark3><br>
The unfathomable hell <mark3>within,</mark3><br>
The horror of their deeds to <mark3>view,</mark3><br>
To know and loathe, yet wish and <mark3>do!</mark3><br>
Such griefs with such men well <mark3>agree,</mark3><br>
But wherefore, wherefore fall on <mark1>me?</mark1><br>
To be loved is all I <mark4>need,</mark4><br>
And whom I love, I love <mark3>indeed.</mark3><br>
