Title : First Kiss <br>
Author : Kim Addonizio <br><br>

Afterwards you had that <mark4>drunk</mark4>, drugged <mark4>look</mark4><br>
my daughter used to get, when she had let go <br>
of my nipple, her mouth gone slack and her eyes   <br>
turned vague and filmy, as though behind them   <br>
the milk was rising up to fill <mark1>her</mark1><br>
whole head, that would loll on the <mark4>small</mark4><br>
white stalk of her neck so I would have to hold <mark1>her</mark1><br>
<mark4>closer</mark4>, amazed at the sheer <mark4>power</mark4><br>
of satiety, which was nothing like the <mark4>needing</mark4><br>
to be <mark4>fed</mark4>, the wild flailing and crying until she <mark4>fastened</mark4><br>
herself to me and made the seal <mark4>tight</mark4><br>
between us, and sucked, drawing the liquid <mark4>down</mark4><br>
and out of my body; no, this was the <mark4>crowning</mark4><br>
moment, this giving of herself, <mark4>knowing</mark4><br>
she could show me how <mark4>helpless</mark4><br>
she was--that's what I saw, that night when you   <br>
pulled your mouth from mine <mark3>and</mark3><br>
leaned back against a chain-link <mark4>fence,</mark4><br>
in front of a burned-out church: a <mark4>man</mark4><br>
who was going to be that <mark4>vulnerable,</mark4><br>
that easy and impossible to <mark4>hurt.</mark4><br>
