Title : Ave Maria <br>
Author : Frank O'Hara <br><br>

Mothers of <mark4>America</mark4><br>
let your kids go to the <mark4>movies!</mark4><br>
get them out of the house so they won't know what you're up <mark4>to</mark4><br>
it's true that fresh air is good for the <mark4>body</mark4><br>
                                                                             but what about the soul   <br>
that grows in darkness, embossed by silvery <mark4>images</mark4><br>
and when you grow old as grow old you <mark4>must</mark4><br>
they won't hate <mark3>you</mark3><br>
they won't criticize you they won't know <br>
they'll be in some glamorous <mark4>country</mark4><br>
they first saw on a Saturday afternoon or playing hookey <br>
<br>
they may even be grateful to <mark1>you</mark1><br>
for their first sexual <mark4>experience</mark4><br>
which only cost you a <mark4>quarter</mark4><br>
and didn't upset the peaceful <mark4>home</mark4><br>
they will know where candy bars come <mark4>from</mark4><br>
                                                                                 and gratuitous bags of popcorn   <br>
as gratuitous as leaving the movie before it's <mark4>over</mark4><br>
with a pleasant stranger whose apartment is in the Heaven on Earth Bldg   <br>
near the Williamsburg Bridge <br>
                                                       oh mothers you will have made the little tykes <br>
so happy because if nobody does pick them up in the <mark1>movies</mark1><br>
they won't know the <mark4>difference</mark4><br>
and if somebody does it'll be sheer <mark4>gravy</mark4><br>
and they'll have been truly entertained either way <br>
instead of hanging around the yard <br>
or up in their <mark4>room</mark4><br>
hating <mark1>you</mark1><br>
prematurely since you won't have done anything horribly mean <mark4>yet</mark4><br>
except keeping them from the darker <mark4>joys</mark4><br>
it's unforgivable the <mark4>latter</mark4><br>
so don't blame me if you won't take this <mark4>advice</mark4><br>
                                                                                      and the family breaks up   <br>
and your children grow old and blind in front of a TV <mark3>set</mark3><br>
<br>
movies you wouldn't let them see when they were <mark5>young</mark5><br>
