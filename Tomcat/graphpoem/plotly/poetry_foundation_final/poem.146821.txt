Title : Edward Hopper Study: Hotel Room <br>
Author : Victoria Chang <br><br>

While the man is <mark3>away</mark3><br>
telling his <mark4>wife</mark4><br>
about the red-corseted <mark4>woman,</mark4><br>
the woman <mark4>waits</mark4><br>
on the queen-sized <mark4>bed.</mark4><br>
You'd expect her quiet    <br>
in the fist of a <mark4>copper</mark4><br>
statue. Half her <mark4>face,</mark4><br>
a shade of golden meringue,    <br>
the other half, the <mark4>dark</mark4><br>
of cattails. Her mouth <mark4>even--</mark4><br>
too straight, as if she <mark4>doubted</mark4><br>
her made decision, the <mark3>way</mark3><br>
women do. In her <mark4>hands,</mark4><br>
a yellow letter creased,    <br>
like her hunched <mark4>back.</mark4><br>
Her dress limp on a green chair.    <br>
In front, a man's satchel    <br>
and briefcase. On a <mark4>dresser,</mark4><br>
a hat with a <mark4>ceylon</mark4><br>
feather. That is all    <br>
the artist left us with,    <br>
knowing we would <mark4>turn</mark4><br>
the woman's stone into <mark4>ours,</mark4><br>
a thirst for the <mark4>self</mark4><br>
in <mark5>everything--even</mark5><br>
in the sweet <mark4>chinks</mark4><br>
of <mark4>mandarin.</mark4><br>
