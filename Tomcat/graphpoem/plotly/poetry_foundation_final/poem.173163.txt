Title : A Boat Beneath a Sunny Sky <br>
Author : Lewis Carroll <br><br>

A BOAT beneath a sunny <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
Lingering onward <mark5>dreamily</mark5><br>
In an evening of July <mark3>--</mark3><br>
<br>
Children three that nestle <mark3>near,</mark3><br>
Eager eye and willing <mark3>ear,</mark3><br>
Pleased a simple tale to hear <mark3>--</mark3><br>
<br>
Long has paled that sunny <mark1>sky:</mark1><br>
Echoes fade and memories <mark3>die:</mark3><br>
Autumn frosts have slain <mark1>July.</mark1><br>
<br>
Still she haunts me, phantomwise, <br>
Alice moving under <mark3>skies</mark3><br>
Never seen by waking <mark3>eyes.</mark3><br>
<br>
Children yet, the tale to <mark1>hear,</mark1><br>
Eager eye and willing <mark1>ear,</mark1><br>
Lovingly shall nestle <mark1>near.</mark1><br>
<br>
In a Wonderland they <mark3>lie,</mark3><br>
Dreaming as the days go <mark3>by,</mark3><br>
Dreaming as the summers <mark1>die:</mark1><br>
<br>
Ever drifting down the stream <mark3>--</mark3><br>
Lingering in the golden gleam <mark3>--</mark3><br>
Life, what is it but a <mark3>dream?</mark3><br>
