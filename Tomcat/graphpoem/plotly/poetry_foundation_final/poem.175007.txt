Title : Paradise Lost: Book 2 (1674 version) <br>
Author : John Milton <br><br>

HIgh on a Throne of Royal State, which <mark4>far</mark4><br>
Outshon the wealth of Ormus and of Ind, <br>
Or where the gorgeous East with richest <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
Showrs on her Kings Barbaric Pearl and <mark4>Gold,</mark4><br>
Satan exalted sat, by merit <mark4>rais'd</mark4><br>
To that bad eminence; and from <mark4>despair</mark4><br>
Thus high uplifted beyond hope, <mark4>aspires</mark4><br>
Beyond thus high, insatiate to <mark1>pursue</mark1><br>
Vain Warr with Heav'n, and by success untaught <br>
His proud imaginations thus <mark5>displaid.</mark5><br>
<br>
Powers and Dominions, Deities of <mark1>Heav'n,</mark1><br>
For since no deep within her gulf can <mark3>hold</mark3><br>
Immortal vigor, though opprest and <mark4>fall'n,</mark4><br>
I give not Heav'n for <mark4>lost</mark4>, From this <mark5>descent</mark5><br>
Celestial vertues rising, will <mark4>appear</mark4><br>
More glorious and more dread then from no <mark5>fall,</mark5><br>
And trust themselves to fear no second <mark4>fate:</mark4><br>
Mee though just right, and the fixt Laws of <mark1>Heav'n</mark1><br>
Did first create your Leader, next free <mark4>choice,</mark4><br>
With what besides, in Counsel or in <mark4>Fight,</mark4><br>
Hath bin achievd of merit, yet this <mark4>loss</mark4><br>
Thus farr at least recover'd, hath much <mark4>more</mark4><br>
Establisht in a safe unenvied <mark4>Throne</mark4><br>
Yielded with full <mark4>consent</mark4>, The happier <mark4>state</mark4><br>
In Heav'n, which follows dignity, might <mark3>draw</mark3><br>
Envy from each inferior; but who <mark4>here</mark4><br>
Will envy whom the highest place <mark4>exposes</mark4><br>
Formost to stand against the Thunderers <mark3>aim</mark3><br>
Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest <mark4>share</mark4><br>
Of endless pain? where there is then no <mark4>good</mark4><br>
For which to strive, no strife can grow up <mark3>there</mark3><br>
From Faction; for none sure will claim in <mark4>Hell</mark4><br>
Precedence, none, whose portion is so <mark4>small</mark4><br>
Of present pain, that with ambitious <mark4>mind</mark4><br>
Will covet more.   With this advantage <mark4>then</mark4><br>
To union, and firm Faith, and firm <mark4>accord,</mark4><br>
More then can be in Heav'n, we now <mark4>return</mark4><br>
To claim our just inheritance of <mark4>old,</mark4><br>
Surer to prosper then <mark5>prosperity</mark5><br>
Could have assur'd us; and by what best <mark1>way,</mark1><br>
Whether of open Warr or covert <mark4>guile,</mark4><br>
We now debate; who can advise, may <mark4>speak.</mark4><br>
<br>
He ceas'd, and next him Moloc, Scepter'd <mark4>King</mark4><br>
Stood up, the strongest and the fiercest <mark4>Spirit</mark4><br>
That fought in Heav'n; now fiercer by <mark1>despair:</mark1><br>
His trust was with th' Eternal to be <mark4>deem'd</mark4><br>
Equal in strength, and rather then be <mark4>less</mark4><br>
Car'd not to be at all; with that care <mark4>lost</mark4><br>
Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or <mark4>worse</mark4><br>
He reck'd not, and these words thereafter <mark4>spake.</mark4><br>
<br>
My sentence is for open Warr: Of <mark4>Wiles,</mark4><br>
More unexpert, I boast not: them let <mark4>those</mark4><br>
Contrive who need, or when they need, not <mark1>now.</mark1><br>
For while they sit contriving, shall the <mark4>rest,</mark4><br>
Millions that stand in Arms, and longing <mark4>wait</mark4><br>
The Signal to ascend, sit lingring <mark1>here</mark1><br>
Heav'ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling <mark4>place</mark4><br>
Accept this dark opprobrious Den of <mark3>shame,</mark3><br>
The Prison of his Tyranny who <mark4>Reigns</mark4><br>
By our delay? no, let us rather <mark4>choose</mark4><br>
Arm'd with Hell flames and fury all at <mark4>once</mark4><br>
O're Heav'ns high Towrs to force resistless <mark1>way,</mark1><br>
Turning our Tortures into horrid <mark4>Arms</mark4><br>
Against the Torturer; when to meet the <mark4>noise</mark4><br>
Of his Almighty Engin he shall <mark2>hear</mark2><br>
Infernal Thunder, and for Lightning <mark5>see</mark5><br>
Black fire and horror shot with equal <mark4>rage</mark4><br>
Among his Angels; and his Throne it <mark4>self</mark4><br>
Mixt with Tartarean <mark4>Sulphur</mark4>, and strange <mark4>fire,</mark4><br>
His own invented <mark4>Torments</mark4>, But <mark4>perhaps</mark4><br>
The way seems difficult and steep to <mark4>scale</mark4><br>
With upright wing against a higher <mark3>foe.</mark3><br>
Let such bethink them, if the sleepy <mark5>drench</mark5><br>
Of that forgetful Lake benumm not <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
That in our proper motion we <mark4>ascend</mark4><br>
Up to our native seat: descent and <mark1>fall</mark1><br>
To us is adverse.   Who but felt of <mark3>late</mark3><br>
When the fierce Foe hung on our brok'n <mark4>Rear</mark4><br>
Insulting, and pursu'd us through the <mark4>Deep,</mark4><br>
With what compulsion and laborious <mark4>flight</mark4><br>
We sunk thus low?   Th' ascent is easie <mark1>then;</mark1><br>
Th' event is fear'd; should we again <mark4>provoke</mark4><br>
Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may <mark4>find</mark4><br>
To our destruction: if there be in <mark1>Hell</mark1><br>
Fear to be worse destroy'd: what can be <mark1>worse</mark1><br>
Then to dwell here, driv'n out from bliss, <mark4>condemn'd</mark4><br>
In this abhorred deep to utter <mark3>woe;</mark3><br>
Where pain of unextinguishable <mark1>fire</mark1><br>
Must exercise us without hope of <mark4>end</mark4><br>
The Vassals of his anger, when the <mark4>Scourge</mark4><br>
Inexorably, and the torturing <mark4>hour</mark4><br>
Calls us to Penance?   More destroy'd then <mark4>thus</mark4><br>
We should be quite abolisht and <mark4>expire.</mark4><br>
What fear we then? what doubt we to <mark4>incense</mark4><br>
His utmost ire? which to the highth enrag'd, <br>
Will either quite consume <mark4>us</mark4>, and <mark4>reduce</mark4><br>
To nothing this essential, happier <mark4>farr</mark4><br>
Then miserable to have eternal <mark4>being:</mark4><br>
Or if our substance be indeed <mark4>Divine,</mark4><br>
And cannot cease to be, we are at <mark4>worst</mark4><br>
On this side nothing; and by proof we <mark4>feel</mark4><br>
Our power sufficient to disturb his <mark1>Heav'n,</mark1><br>
And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme, <br>
Though inaccessible, his fatal <mark1>Throne:</mark1><br>
Which if not Victory is yet <mark4>Revenge.</mark4><br>
<br>
He ended frowning, and his look denounc'd <br>
Desperate revenge, and Battel <mark4>dangerous</mark4><br>
To less then <mark4>Gods</mark4>, On th' other side up <mark4>rose</mark4><br>
Belial, in act more graceful and <mark4>humane;</mark4><br>
A fairer person lost not Heav'n; he <mark5>seemd</mark5><br>
For dignity compos'd and high <mark4>exploit:</mark4><br>
But all was false and hollow; though his <mark4>Tongue</mark4><br>
Dropt Manna, and could make the worse <mark1>appear</mark1><br>
The better reason, to perplex and <mark4>dash</mark4><br>
Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were <mark3>low;</mark3><br>
To vice industrious, but to Nobler <mark4>deeds</mark4><br>
Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas'd the <mark3>ear,</mark3><br>
And with perswasive accent thus <mark4>began.</mark4><br>
<br>
I should be much for open Warr, O <mark4>Peers,</mark4><br>
As not behind in hate; if what was urg'd <br>
Main reason to perswade immediate <mark4>Warr,</mark4><br>
Did not disswade me <mark4>most</mark4>, and seem to <mark4>cast</mark4><br>
Ominous conjecture on the whole <mark4>success:</mark4><br>
When he who most excels in fact of <mark1>Arms,</mark1><br>
In what he counsels and in what <mark4>excels</mark4><br>
Mistrustful, grounds his courage on <mark1>despair</mark1><br>
And utter dissolution, as the <mark4>scope</mark4><br>
Of all his aim, after some dire <mark1>revenge.</mark1><br>
First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav'n are <mark4>fill'd</mark4><br>
With Armed watch, that render all <mark4>access</mark4><br>
Impregnable; oft on the bordering <mark1>Deep</mark1><br>
Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure <mark4>wing</mark4><br>
Scout farr and wide into the Realm of <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
Scorning surprize.   Or could we break our <mark1>way</mark1><br>
By force, and at our heels all Hell should <mark4>rise</mark4><br>
With blackest Insurrection, to <mark4>confound</mark4><br>
Heav'ns purest Light, yet our great <mark4>Enemy</mark4><br>
All incorruptible would on his <mark1>Throne</mark1><br>
Sit unpolluted, and th' Ethereal <mark4>mould</mark4><br>
Incapable of stain would soon <mark4>expel</mark4><br>
Her mischief, and purge off the baser <mark1>fire</mark1><br>
Victorious.   Thus repuls'd, our final <mark4>hope</mark4><br>
Is flat despair: we must <mark4>exasperate</mark4><br>
Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his <mark1>rage,</mark1><br>
And that must end us, that must be our <mark4>cure,</mark4><br>
To be no more; sad cure; for who would <mark4>loose,</mark4><br>
Though full of pain, this intellectual <mark1>being,</mark1><br>
Those thoughts that wander through <mark4>Eternity,</mark4><br>
To perish rather, swallowd up and <mark1>lost</mark1><br>
In the wide womb of uncreated <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
Devoid of sense and motion? and who <mark4>knows,</mark4><br>
Let this be good, whether our angry <mark1>Foe</mark1><br>
Can give it, or will ever? how he <mark4>can</mark4><br>
Is doubtful; that he never will is <mark3>sure.</mark3><br>
Will he, so wise, let loose at once his <mark4>ire,</mark4><br>
Belike through impotence, or <mark4>unaware,</mark4><br>
To give his Enemies thir wish, and <mark1>end</mark1><br>
Them in his anger, whom his anger <mark4>saves</mark4><br>
To punish endless? wherefore cease we <mark1>then?</mark1><br>
Say they who counsel Warr, we are <mark4>decreed,</mark4><br>
Reserv'd and destin'd to Eternal <mark1>woe;</mark1><br>
Whatever doing, what can we suffer <mark1>more,</mark1><br>
What can we suffer worse? is this then <mark1>worst,</mark1><br>
Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in <mark1>Arms?</mark1><br>
What when we fled amain, pursu'd and <mark5>strook</mark5><br>
With Heav'ns afflicting Thunder, and <mark5>besought</mark5><br>
The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then <mark4>seem'd</mark4><br>
A refuge from those wounds: or when we <mark3>lay</mark3><br>
Chain'd on the burning Lake? that sure was <mark1>worse.</mark1><br>
What if the breath that kindl'd those grim <mark4>fires</mark4><br>
Awak'd should blow them into sevenfold <mark1>rage</mark1><br>
And plunge us in the flames? or from <mark4>above</mark4><br>
Should intermitted vengeance arm <mark3>again</mark3><br>
His red right hand to plague us? what if <mark4>all</mark4><br>
Her stores were open'd, and this <mark5>Firmament</mark5><br>
Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of <mark1>Fire</mark1><br>
Impendent horrors, threatning hideous <mark1>fall</mark1><br>
One day upon our heads; while we <mark1>perhaps</mark1><br>
Designing or exhorting glorious <mark1>warr,</mark1><br>
Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be <mark4>hurl'd</mark4><br>
Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and <mark3>prey</mark3><br>
Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever <mark4>sunk</mark4><br>
Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in <mark4>Chains;</mark4><br>
There to converse with everlasting <mark4>groans,</mark4><br>
Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd, <br>
Ages of hopeless end; this would be <mark1>worse.</mark1><br>
Warr therefore, open or conceal'd, <mark4>alike</mark4><br>
My voice disswades; for what can force or <mark1>guile</mark1><br>
With him, or who deceive his mind, whose <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
Views all things at one view? he from heav'ns <mark5>highth</mark5><br>
All these our motions vain, sees and <mark4>derides;</mark4><br>
Not more Almighty to resist our <mark4>might</mark4><br>
Then wise to frustrate all our plots and <mark1>wiles.</mark1><br>
Shall we then live thus vile, the Race of <mark1>Heav'n</mark1><br>
Thus trampl'd, thus expell'd to suffer <mark1>here</mark1><br>
Chains and these Torments? better these then <mark1>worse</mark1><br>
By my advice; since fate <mark4>inevitable</mark4><br>
Subdues us, and Omnipotent <mark3>Decree,</mark3><br>
The Victors will.   To suffer, as to <mark3>doe,</mark3><br>
Our strength is equal, nor the Law <mark4>unjust</mark4><br>
That so ordains: this was at first <mark5>resolv'd,</mark5><br>
If we were wise, against so great a <mark1>foe</mark1><br>
Contending, and so doubtful what might <mark1>fall.</mark1><br>
I laugh, when those who at the Spear are <mark4>bold</mark4><br>
And vent'rous, if that fail them, shrink and <mark4>fear</mark4><br>
What yet they know must follow, to <mark4>endure</mark4><br>
Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or <mark3>pain,</mark3><br>
The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is <mark1>now</mark1><br>
Our doom; which if we can sustain and <mark4>bear,</mark4><br>
Our Supream Foe in time may much <mark4>remit</mark4><br>
His anger, and perhaps thus farr <mark5>remov'd</mark5><br>
Not mind us not offending, <mark5>satisfi'd</mark5><br>
With what is <mark4>punish't</mark4>, whence these raging <mark1>fires</mark1><br>
Will <mark4>slack'n</mark4>, if his breath stir not thir <mark4>flames.</mark4><br>
Our purer essence then will <mark4>overcome</mark4><br>
Thir noxious vapour, or enur'd not <mark1>feel,</mark1><br>
Or chang'd at length, and to the place <mark5>conformd</mark5><br>
In temper and in nature, will <mark4>receive</mark4><br>
Familiar the fierce heat, and void of <mark1>pain;</mark1><br>
This horror will grow milde, this darkness <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
Besides what hope the never-ending <mark1>flight</mark1><br>
Of future dayes may bring, what chance, what <mark4>change</mark4><br>
Worth waiting, since our present lot <mark5>appeers</mark5><br>
For happy though but ill, for ill not <mark1>worst,</mark1><br>
If we procure not to our selves more <mark1>woe.</mark1><br>
<br>
Thus Belial with words cloath'd in reasons <mark4>garb</mark4><br>
Counsel'd ignoble ease, and peaceful <mark5>sloath,</mark5><br>
Not peace: and after him thus Mammon <mark1>spake.</mark1><br>
<br>
Either to disinthrone the King of <mark1>Heav'n</mark1><br>
We warr, if warr be best, or to <mark3>regain</mark3><br>
Our own right lost: him to unthrone we <mark1>then</mark1><br>
May hope when everlasting Fathe shall yeild <br>
To fickle Chance and Chaos judge the <mark4>strife:</mark4><br>
The former vain to hope argues as <mark4>vain</mark4><br>
The latter: for what place can be for <mark4>us</mark4><br>
Within Heav'ns bound, unless Heav'ns Lord <mark1>supream</mark1><br>
We overpower?   Suppose he should <mark4>relent</mark4><br>
And publish Grace to all, on promise <mark4>made</mark4><br>
Of new Subjection; with what eyes could <mark3>we</mark3><br>
Stand in his presence humble, and <mark1>receive</mark1><br>
Strict Laws impos'd, to celebrate his <mark1>Throne</mark1><br>
With warbl'd Hymns, and to his God head <mark4>sing</mark4><br>
Forc't Halleluia's; while he Lordly <mark4>sits</mark4><br>
Our envied Sovran, and his Altar <mark4>breathes</mark4><br>
Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial <mark4>Flowers,</mark4><br>
Our servile offerings.   This must be our <mark4>task</mark4><br>
In Heav'n this our delight; how wearisom <br>
Eternity so spent in worship <mark3>paid</mark3><br>
To whom we hate.   Let us not then <mark1>pursue</mark1><br>
By force impossible, by leave <mark4>obtain'd</mark4><br>
Unacceptable, though in Heav'n, our <mark1>state</mark1><br>
Of splendid vassalage, but rather <mark4>seek</mark4><br>
Our own good from our selves, and from our <mark3>own</mark3><br>
Live to our selves, though in this vast <mark4>recess,</mark4><br>
Free, and to none accountable, <mark4>preferring</mark4><br>
Hard liberty before the easie <mark4>yoke</mark4><br>
Of servile Pomp.   Our greatness will <mark5>appeer</mark5><br>
Then most conspicuous, when great things of <mark1>small,</mark1><br>
Useful of hurtful, prosperous of <mark4>adverse</mark4><br>
We can create, and in what place so <mark4>e're</mark4><br>
Thrive under evil, and work ease out of <mark1>pain</mark1><br>
Through labour and indurance.   This deep <mark4>world</mark4><br>
Of darkness do we dread? How oft <mark4>amidst</mark4><br>
Thick clouds and dark doth Heav'ns all-ruling <mark3>Sire</mark3><br>
Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur'd, <br>
And with the Majesty of darkness <mark4>round</mark4><br>
Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders <mark4>roar</mark4><br>
Must'ring thir rage, and Heav'n resembles <mark1>Hell?</mark1><br>
As he our darkness, cannot we his <mark1>Light</mark1><br>
Imitate when we please? This Desart <mark5>soile</mark5><br>
Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and <mark1>Gold;</mark1><br>
Nor want we skill or Art, from whence to <mark4>raise</mark4><br>
Magnificence; and what can Heav'n shew <mark1>more?</mark1><br>
Our torments also may in length of <mark4>time</mark4><br>
Become our Elements, these piercing <mark1>Fires</mark1><br>
As soft as now severe, our temper <mark4>chang'd</mark4><br>
Into their temper; which must needs <mark4>remove</mark4><br>
The sensible of pain.   All things <mark3>invite</mark3><br>
To peaceful Counsels, and the settl'd <mark1>State</mark1><br>
Of order, how in safety best we <mark3>may</mark3><br>
Compose our present evils, with <mark4>regard</mark4><br>
Of what we are and were, dismissing <mark4>quite</mark4><br>
All thoughts of warr: ye have what I <mark4>advise.</mark4><br>
<br>
He scarce had finisht, when such murmur <mark5>filld</mark5><br>
Th' Assembly, as when hollow Rocks <mark3>retain</mark3><br>
The sound of blustring winds, which all night <mark4>long</mark4><br>
Had rous'd the Sea, now with hoarse cadence <mark4>lull</mark4><br>
Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by <mark4>chance</mark4><br>
Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy <mark3>Bay</mark3><br>
After the Tempest:   Such applause was <mark4>heard</mark4><br>
As Mammon ended, and his Sentence <mark4>pleas'd,</mark4><br>
Advising peace: for such another <mark4>Field</mark4><br>
They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the <mark1>fear</mark1><br>
Of Thunder and the Sword of <mark4>Michael</mark4><br>
Wrought still within them; and no less <mark3>desire</mark3><br>
To found this nether Empire, which might <mark1>rise</mark1><br>
By pollicy, and long process of <mark1>time,</mark1><br>
In emulation opposite to <mark1>Heav'n.</mark1><br>
Which when Beelzebub perceiv'd, then <mark4>whom,</mark4><br>
Satan except, none higher sat, with <mark4>grave</mark4><br>
Aspect he <mark4>rose</mark4>, and in his rising <mark1>seem'd</mark1><br>
A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven <br>
Deliberation sat and public <mark4>care;</mark4><br>
And Princely counsel in his face yet <mark4>shon,</mark4><br>
Majestic though in ruin: sage he <mark4>stood</mark4><br>
With Atlantean shoulders fit to <mark1>bear</mark1><br>
The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his <mark4>look</mark4><br>
Drew audience and attention still as <mark1>Night</mark1><br>
Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he <mark1>spake.</mark1><br>
<br>
Thrones and Imperial Powers, off-spring of <mark1>heav'n</mark1><br>
Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles <mark1>now</mark1><br>
Must we renounce, and changing stile be <mark4>call'd</mark4><br>
Princes of Hell? for so the popular <mark4>vote</mark4><br>
Inclines, here to continue, and build up <mark1>here</mark1><br>
A growing Empire; doubtless; while we <mark4>dream,</mark4><br>
And know not that the King of Heav'n hath <mark4>doom'd</mark4><br>
This place our dungeon, not our safe <mark4>retreat</mark4><br>
Beyond his Potent arm, to live <mark4>exempt</mark4><br>
From Heav'ns high jurisdiction, in new <mark4>League</mark4><br>
Banded against his Throne, but to <mark5>remaine</mark5><br>
In strictest bondage, though thus far <mark1>remov'd,</mark1><br>
Under th' inevitable curb, <mark5>reserv'd</mark5><br>
His captive multitude: For he, be <mark1>sure</mark1><br>
In heighth or depth, still first and last will <mark4>Reign</mark4><br>
Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no <mark4>part</mark4><br>
By our revolt, but over Hell <mark4>extend</mark4><br>
His Empire, and with Iron Scepter <mark4>rule</mark4><br>
Us here, as with his Golden those in <mark1>Heav'n.</mark1><br>
What sit we then projecting peace and <mark1>Warr?</mark1><br>
Warr hath determin'd <mark4>us</mark4>, and foild with <mark1>loss</mark1><br>
Irreparable; tearms of peace yet <mark4>none</mark4><br>
Voutsaf't or sought; for what peace will be giv'n <br>
To us enslav'd, but custody <mark4>severe,</mark4><br>
And stripes, and arbitrary <mark4>punishment</mark4><br>
Inflicted? and what peace can we <mark1>return,</mark1><br>
But to our power hostility and <mark4>hate,</mark4><br>
Untam'd reluctance, and revenge though <mark3>slow,</mark3><br>
Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror <mark4>least</mark4><br>
May reap his conquest, and may least <mark5>rejoyce</mark5><br>
In doing what we most in suffering <mark1>feel?</mark1><br>
Nor will occasion want, nor shall we <mark4>need</mark4><br>
With dangerous expedition to <mark4>invade</mark4><br>
Heav'n, whose high walls fear no assault or <mark4>Siege,</mark4><br>
Or ambush from the Deep.   What if we <mark1>find</mark1><br>
Some easier enterprize? There is a <mark1>place</mark1><br>
(If ancient and prophetic fame in <mark1>Heav'n</mark1><br>
Err not) another World, the happy <mark4>seat</mark4><br>
Of some new Race call'd Man, about this <mark1>time</mark1><br>
To be created like to <mark3>us</mark3>, though <mark1>less</mark1><br>
In power and excellence, but favour'd <mark1>more</mark1><br>
Of him who rules above; so was his <mark4>will</mark4><br>
Pronounc'd among the Gods, and by an <mark4>Oath,</mark4><br>
That shook Heav'ns whol circumference, <mark4>confirm'd.</mark4><br>
Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to <mark3>learn</mark3><br>
What creatures there inhabit, of what <mark1>mould,</mark1><br>
Or substance, how endu'd, and what thir <mark4>Power,</mark4><br>
And where thir weakness, how attempted <mark4>best,</mark4><br>
By force or suttlety: Though Heav'n be <mark4>shut,</mark4><br>
And Heav'ns high Arbitrator sit <mark4>secure</mark4><br>
In his own strength, this place may lye <mark4>expos'd</mark4><br>
The utmost border of his Kingdom, <mark4>left</mark4><br>
To their defence who hold it: here <mark1>perhaps</mark1><br>
Som advantagious act may be achiev'd <br>
By sudden onset, either with Hell <mark1>fire</mark1><br>
To waste his whole Creation, or <mark4>possess</mark4><br>
All as our <mark4>own</mark4>, and drive as we were <mark4>driven,</mark4><br>
The punie habitants, or if not <mark4>drive,</mark4><br>
Seduce them to our Party, that thir <mark4>God</mark4><br>
May prove thir foe, and with repenting <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
Abolish his own <mark4>works</mark4>, This would <mark4>surpass</mark4><br>
Common revenge, and interrupt his <mark1>joy</mark1><br>
In our Confusion, and our joy <mark5>upraise</mark5><br>
In his disturbance; when his darling <mark4>Sons</mark4><br>
HurI'd headlong to partake with <mark4>us</mark4>, shall <mark4>curse</mark4><br>
Thir frail Original, and faded <mark4>bliss,</mark4><br>
Faded so soon.   Advise if this be <mark4>worth</mark4><br>
Attempting, or to sit in darkness <mark1>here</mark1><br>
Hatching vain Empires. Thus Beelzebub <br>
Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first <mark5>devis'd</mark5><br>
By Satan, and in part propos'd: for <mark4>whence,</mark4><br>
But from the Author of all ill could <mark4>Spring</mark4><br>
So deep a <mark4>malice</mark4>, to confound the <mark4>race</mark4><br>
Of mankind in one root, and Earth with <mark1>Hell</mark1><br>
To mingle and involve, done all to <mark4>spite</mark4><br>
The great Creatour?   But thir spite still <mark4>serves</mark4><br>
His glory to augment.   The bold <mark4>design</mark4><br>
Pleas'd highly those infernal States, and <mark1>joy</mark1><br>
Sparkl'd in all thir eyes; with full <mark4>assent</mark4><br>
They vote: whereat his speech he thus <mark4>renews.</mark4><br>
<br>
Well have ye judg'd, well ended long <mark4>debate,</mark4><br>
Synod of Gods, and like to what ye <mark4>are,</mark4><br>
Great things resolv'd; which from the lowest <mark1>deep</mark1><br>
Will once more lift us up, in spight of <mark1>Fate,</mark1><br>
Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in <mark3>view</mark3><br>
Of those bright <mark4>confines</mark4>, whence with neighbouring <mark1>Arms</mark1><br>
And opportune excursion we may <mark1>chance</mark1><br>
Re-enter Heav'n; or else in some milde <mark4>Zone</mark4><br>
Dwell not unvisited of Heav'ns fair <mark1>Light</mark1><br>
Secure, and at the brightning Orient <mark4>beam</mark4><br>
Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious <mark4>Air,</mark4><br>
To heal the scarr of these corrosive <mark1>Fires</mark1><br>
Shall breathe her balme.   But first whom shall we <mark4>send</mark4><br>
In search of this new <mark4>world</mark4>, whom shall we <mark1>find</mark1><br>
Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring <mark4>feet</mark4><br>
The dark unbottom'd infinite <mark4>Abyss</mark4><br>
And through the palpable obscure find <mark4>out</mark4><br>
His uncouth way, or spread his aerie <mark1>flight</mark1><br>
Upborn with indefatigable <mark4>wings</mark4><br>
Over the vast abrupt, ere he <mark3>arrive</mark3><br>
The happy Ile; what strength, what art can <mark1>then</mark1><br>
Suffice, or what evasion bear him <mark4>safe</mark4><br>
Through the strict Senteries and Stations <mark4>thick</mark4><br>
Of Angels watching round?   Here he had <mark1>need</mark1><br>
All circumspection, and we now no <mark1>less</mark1><br>
Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we <mark1>send,</mark1><br>
The weight of all and our last hope <mark4>relies.</mark4><br>
<br>
This said, he sat; and expectation <mark4>held</mark4><br>
His look suspence, awaiting who <mark5>appeer'd</mark5><br>
To second, or oppose, or <mark4>undertake</mark4><br>
The perilous attempt: but all sat <mark4>mute,</mark4><br>
Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and <mark4>each</mark4><br>
In others count'nance read his own <mark3>dismay</mark3><br>
Astonisht: none among the choice and <mark4>prime</mark4><br>
Of those Heav'n-warring Champions could be <mark4>found</mark4><br>
So hardie as to proffer or <mark4>accept</mark4><br>
Alone the dreadful voyage; till at <mark4>last</mark4><br>
Satan, whom now transcendent glory <mark1>rais'd</mark1><br>
Above his fellows, with Monarchal <mark4>pride</mark4><br>
Conscious of highest worth, unmov'd thus <mark1>spake.</mark1><br>
<br>
O Progeny of Heav'n, Empyreal <mark5>Thrones,</mark5><br>
With reason hath deep silence and demurr <br>
Seis'd us, though undismaid: long is the <mark1>way</mark1><br>
And hard, that out of Hell leads up to <mark1>light;</mark1><br>
Our prison strong, this huge convex of <mark1>Fire,</mark1><br>
Outrageous to devour, immures us <mark1>round</mark1><br>
Ninefold, and gates of burning <mark4>Adamant</mark4><br>
Barr'd over us prohibit all <mark3>egress.</mark3><br>
These past, if any pass, the void <mark3>profound</mark3><br>
Of unessential Night receives him <mark4>next</mark4><br>
Wide <mark4>gaping</mark4>, and with utter loss of <mark1>being</mark1><br>
Threatens him, plung'd in that abortive <mark4>gulf.</mark4><br>
If thence he scape into whatever <mark1>world,</mark1><br>
Or unknown Region, what remains him <mark1>less</mark1><br>
Then unknown dangers and as hard <mark4>escape.</mark4><br>
But I should ill become this Throne, O <mark1>Peers,</mark1><br>
And this Imperial Sov'ranty, <mark4>adorn'd</mark4><br>
With splendor, arm'd with power, if aught <mark5>propos'd</mark5><br>
And judg'd of public moment, in the <mark3>shape</mark3><br>
Of difficulty or danger could deterr <br>
Mee from attempting.   Wherefore do I <mark4>assume</mark4><br>
These Royalties, and not refuse to <mark1>Reign,</mark1><br>
Refusing to accept as great a <mark1>share</mark1><br>
Of hazard as of honour, due <mark1>alike</mark1><br>
To him who Reigns, and so much to him <mark3>due</mark3><br>
Of hazard more, as he above the <mark1>rest</mark1><br>
High honourd sits? Go therfore mighty <mark4>Powers,</mark4><br>
Terror of Heav'n, though fall'n; intend at <mark4>home,</mark4><br>
While here shall be our home, what best may <mark4>ease</mark4><br>
The present misery, and render <mark1>Hell</mark1><br>
More tollerable; if there be cure or <mark4>charm</mark4><br>
To respite or deceive, or slack the <mark1>pain</mark1><br>
Of this ill Mansion: intermit no <mark4>watch</mark4><br>
Against a wakeful Foe, while I <mark4>abroad</mark4><br>
Through all the Coasts of dark destruction <mark1>seek</mark1><br>
Deliverance for us all: this <mark5>enterprize</mark5><br>
None shall partake with me.   Thus saying <mark1>rose</mark1><br>
The Monarch, and prevented all <mark3>reply,</mark3><br>
Prudent, least from his resolution <mark1>rais'd</mark1><br>
Others among the chief might offer <mark1>now</mark1><br>
(Certain to be refus'd) what erst they <mark5>feard;</mark5><br>
And so refus'd might in opinion <mark4>stand</mark4><br>
His Rivals, winning cheap the high <mark4>repute</mark4><br>
Which he through hazard huge must earn.   But <mark3>they</mark3><br>
Dreaded not more th' adventure then his <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
Forbidding; and at once with him they <mark1>rose;</mark1><br>
Thir rising all at once was as the <mark4>sound</mark4><br>
Of Thunder heard remote. Towards him they <mark4>bend</mark4><br>
With awful reverence prone; and as a <mark1>God</mark1><br>
Extoll him equal to the highest in <mark1>Heav'n:</mark1><br>
Nor fail'd they to express how much they prais'd, <br>
That for the general safety he <mark5>despis'd</mark5><br>
His own: for neither do the Spirits <mark4>damn'd</mark4><br>
Loose all thir virtue; least bad men should <mark4>boast</mark4><br>
Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory <mark4>excites,</mark4><br>
Or clos ambition varnisht o're with <mark4>zeal.</mark4><br>
Thus they thir doubtful consultations <mark4>dark</mark4><br>
Ended rejoycing in thir matchless <mark4>Chief:</mark4><br>
As when from mountain tops the dusky <mark4>clouds</mark4><br>
Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, <mark4>o'respread</mark4><br>
Heav'ns chearful face, the lowring <mark4>Element</mark4><br>
Scowls ore the dark'nd lantskip Snow, or <mark5>showre;</mark5><br>
If chance the radiant Sun with farewell <mark4>sweet</mark4><br>
Extend his ev'ning beam, the fields <mark3>revive,</mark3><br>
The birds thir notes renew, and bleating <mark4>herds</mark4><br>
Attest thir joy, that hill and valley <mark4>rings.</mark4><br>
O shame to men!   Devil with Devil <mark1>damn'd</mark1><br>
Firm concord holds, men onely <mark3>disagree</mark3><br>
Of Creatures rational, though under <mark1>hope</mark1><br>
Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming <mark4>peace,</mark4><br>
Yet live in hatred, enmity, and <mark1>strife</mark1><br>
Among themselves, and levie cruel <mark5>warres,</mark5><br>
Wasting the Earth, each other to <mark3>destroy:</mark3><br>
As if (which might induce us to <mark1>accord)</mark1><br>
Man had not hellish foes anow <mark4>besides,</mark4><br>
That day and night for his destruction <mark4>waite.</mark4><br>
<br>
The Stygian Counsel thus dissolv'd; and <mark4>forth</mark4><br>
In order came the grand infernal <mark1>Peers,</mark1><br>
Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and <mark1>seemd</mark1><br>
Alone th' Antagonist of Heav'n, nor <mark1>less</mark1><br>
Than Hells dread Emperour with pomp <mark1>Supream,</mark1><br>
And God-like imitated State; him <mark1>round</mark1><br>
A Globe of fierie Seraphim <mark5>inclos'd</mark5><br>
With bright imblazonrie, and horrent <mark1>Arms.</mark1><br>
Then of thir Session ended they bid <mark3>cry</mark3><br>
With Trumpets regal sound the great <mark4>result:</mark4><br>
Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim <br>
Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie <br>
By Haralds voice explain'd: the hollow <mark1>Abyss</mark1><br>
Heard farr and wide, and all the host of <mark1>Hell</mark1><br>
With deafning shout, return'd them loud <mark4>acclaim.</mark4><br>
Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat <mark1>rais'd</mark1><br>
By false presumptuous hope, the ranged <mark1>powers</mark1><br>
Disband, and wandring, each his several <mark1>way</mark1><br>
Pursues, as inclination or sad <mark1>choice</mark1><br>
Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest <mark1>find</mark1><br>
Truce to his restless thoughts, and <mark3>entertain</mark3><br>
The irksom hours, till this great Chief <mark1>return.</mark1><br>
Part on the Plain, or in the Air <mark4>sublime</mark4><br>
Upon the wing, or in swift Race <mark4>contend,</mark4><br>
As at th' Olympian Games or Pythian <mark4>fields;</mark4><br>
Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the <mark4>Goal</mark4><br>
With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads <mark4>form.</mark4><br>
As when to warn proud Cities warr <mark4>appears</mark4><br>
Wag'd in the troubl'd Skie, and Armies <mark4>rush</mark4><br>
To Battel in the Clouds, before each <mark4>Van</mark4><br>
Prick forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir <mark3>Spears</mark3><br>
Till thickest Legions <mark4>close</mark4>, with feats of <mark1>Arms</mark1><br>
From either end of Heav'n the welkin <mark4>burns.</mark4><br>
Others with vast Typhoean rage more <mark4>fell</mark4><br>
Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the <mark1>Air</mark1><br>
In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde <mark4>uproar.</mark4><br>
As when Alcides from Oechalia <mark4>Crown'd</mark4><br>
With conquest, felt th' envenom'd robe, and <mark4>tore</mark4><br>
Through pain up by the roots Thessalian <mark4>Pines,</mark4><br>
And Lichas from the top of Oeta <mark3>threw</mark3><br>
Into th' Euboic Sea.   Others more milde, <br>
Retreated in a silent valley, <mark1>sing</mark1><br>
With notes Angelical to many a <mark4>Harp</mark4><br>
Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless <mark1>fall</mark1><br>
By doom of Battel; and complain that <mark1>Fate</mark1><br>
Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or <mark1>Chance.</mark1><br>
Thir Song was partial, but the <mark4>harmony</mark4><br>
(What could it less when Spirits immortal <mark1>sing?)</mark1><br>
Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment <br>
The thronging audience.   In discourse more <mark1>sweet</mark1><br>
(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the <mark4>Sense,)</mark4><br>
Others apart sat on a Hill <mark5>retir'd,</mark5><br>
In thoughts more elevate, and reason'd <mark3>high</mark3><br>
Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will and <mark1>Fate,</mark1><br>
Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledg <mark4>absolute,</mark4><br>
And found no end, in wandring mazes <mark1>lost.</mark1><br>
Of good and evil much they argu'd <mark1>then,</mark1><br>
Of happiness and final <mark4>misery,</mark4><br>
Passion and Apathie, and glory and <mark1>shame,</mark1><br>
Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie: <br>
Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could <mark1>charm</mark1><br>
Pain for a while or anguish, and <mark4>excite</mark4><br>
Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured <mark4>brest</mark4><br>
With stubborn patience as with triple <mark4>steel.</mark4><br>
Another part in Squadrons and gross <mark4>Bands,</mark4><br>
On bold adventure to discover <mark4>wide</mark4><br>
That dismal world, if any Clime <mark1>perhaps</mark1><br>
Might yield them easier habitation, <mark1>bend</mark1><br>
Four ways thir flying March, along the <mark4>Banks</mark4><br>
Of four infernal Rivers that <mark4>disgorge</mark4><br>
Into the burning Lake thir baleful <mark4>streams;</mark4><br>
Abhorred Styx the flood of deadly <mark1>hate,</mark1><br>
Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and <mark1>deep;</mark1><br>
Cocytus, nam'd of lamentation <mark4>loud</mark4><br>
Heard on the ruful stream; fierce Phlegeton <br>
Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with <mark1>rage.</mark1><br>
Farr off from these a slow and silent <mark4>stream,</mark4><br>
Lethe the River of Oblivion <mark5>roules</mark5><br>
Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who <mark4>drinks,</mark4><br>
Forthwith his former state and being <mark4>forgets,</mark4><br>
Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and <mark1>pain.</mark1><br>
Beyond this flood a frozen <mark4>Continent</mark4><br>
Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual <mark4>storms</mark4><br>
Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm <mark4>land</mark4><br>
Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin <mark4>seems</mark4><br>
Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and <mark4>ice,</mark4><br>
A gulf profound as that Serbonian <mark4>Bog</mark4><br>
Betwixt Damiata and mount Casius <mark1>old,</mark1><br>
Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching <mark1>Air</mark1><br>
Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of <mark1>Fire.</mark1><br>
Thither by harpy-footed Furies <mark4>hail'd,</mark4><br>
At certain revolutions all the <mark1>damn'd</mark1><br>
Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter <mark1>change</mark1><br>
Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more <mark4>fierce,</mark4><br>
From Beds of raging Fire to starve in <mark1>Ice</mark1><br>
Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to <mark4>pine</mark4><br>
Immovable, infixt, and frozen <mark1>round,</mark1><br>
Periods of time, thence hurried back to <mark1>fire.</mark1><br>
They ferry over this Lethean <mark1>Sound</mark1><br>
Both to and fro, thir sorrow to <mark4>augment,</mark4><br>
And wish and struggle, as they pass, to <mark4>reach</mark4><br>
The tempting stream, with one small drop to <mark1>loose</mark1><br>
In sweet forgetfulness all pain and <mark1>woe,</mark1><br>
All in one moment, and so neer the <mark4>brink;</mark4><br>
But Fate withstands, and to oppose th' <mark4>attempt</mark4><br>
Medusa with Gorgonian terror <mark4>guards</mark4><br>
The Ford, and of it self the water <mark4>flies</mark4><br>
All taste of living wight, as once it <mark4>fled</mark4><br>
The lip of Tantalus.   Thus roving <mark4>on</mark4><br>
In confus'd march forlorn, th' adventrous <mark1>Bands</mark1><br>
With shuddring horror pale, and eyes <mark5>agast</mark5><br>
View'd first thir lamentable lot, and <mark1>found</mark1><br>
No rest: through many a dark and drearie <mark4>Vaile</mark4><br>
They pass'd, and many a Region dolorous, <br>
O're many a Frozen, many a fierie Alpe, <br>
Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of <mark4>death,</mark4><br>
A Universe of death, which God by <mark1>curse</mark1><br>
Created evil, for evil only <mark1>good,</mark1><br>
Where all life dies, death <mark4>lives</mark4>, and Nature <mark4>breeds,</mark4><br>
Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious <mark4>things,</mark4><br>
Abominable, inutterable, and <mark1>worse</mark1><br>
Than Fables yet have feign'd, or fear <mark5>conceiv'd,</mark5><br>
Gorgons and Hydra's, and Chimera's <mark3>dire.</mark3><br>
<br>
Mean while the Adversary of God and <mark4>Man,</mark4><br>
Satan with thoughts inflam'd of highest <mark1>design,</mark1><br>
Puts on swift wings, and towards the Gates of <mark1>Hell</mark1><br>
Explores his solitary flight; som <mark4>times</mark4><br>
He scours the right hand <mark4>coast</mark4>, som times the <mark1>left,</mark1><br>
Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then <mark4>soares</mark4><br>
Up to the fiery Concave touring <mark1>high.</mark1><br>
As when farr off at Sea a Fleet <mark5>descri'd</mark5><br>
Hangs in the <mark4>Clouds</mark4>, by Aequinoctial <mark4>Winds</mark4><br>
Close sailing from Bengala, or the <mark4>Iles</mark4><br>
Of Ternate and Tidore, whence Merchants <mark3>bring</mark3><br>
Thir spicie Drugs: they on the Trading <mark4>Flood</mark4><br>
Through the wide Ethiopian to the <mark4>Cape</mark4><br>
Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole.   So <mark1>seem'd</mark1><br>
Farr off the flying Fiend: at last <mark1>appeer</mark1><br>
Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid <mark4>Roof,</mark4><br>
And thrice threefold the <mark4>Gates</mark4>, three folds were <mark4>Brass,</mark4><br>
Three Iron, three of Adamantine <mark4>Rock,</mark4><br>
Impenetrable, impal'd with circling <mark1>fire,</mark1><br>
Yet unconsum'd.   Before the Gates there <mark4>sat</mark4><br>
On either side a formidable <mark1>shape;</mark1><br>
The one seem'd Woman to the waste, and <mark4>fair,</mark4><br>
But ended foul in many a scaly <mark5>fould</mark5><br>
Voluminous and vast, a Serpent <mark4>arm'd</mark4><br>
With mortal sting: about her middle <mark1>round</mark1><br>
A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing <mark4>bark'd</mark4><br>
With wide Cerberian mouths full loud, and <mark4>rung</mark4><br>
A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would <mark4>creep,</mark4><br>
If aught disturb'd thir noyse, into her woomb, <br>
And kennel there, yet there still bark'd and <mark4>howl'd,</mark4><br>
Within unseen.   Farr less abhorrd than <mark4>these</mark4><br>
Vex'd Scylla bathing in the Sea that <mark4>parts</mark4><br>
Calabria from the hoarce Trinacrian <mark4>shore:</mark4><br>
Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when <mark1>call'd</mark1><br>
In secret, riding through the Air she <mark4>comes</mark4><br>
Lur'd with the smell of infant blood, to <mark4>dance</mark4><br>
With Lapland Witches, while the labouring <mark4>Moon</mark4><br>
Eclipses at thir charms.   The other <mark1>shape,</mark1><br>
If shape it might be call'd that shape had <mark1>none</mark1><br>
Distinguishable in member, joynt, or <mark4>limb,</mark4><br>
Or substance might be call'd that shadow <mark1>seem'd,</mark1><br>
For each seem'd either; black it stood as <mark1>Night,</mark1><br>
Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as <mark1>Hell,</mark1><br>
And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem'd his <mark4>head</mark4><br>
The likeness of a Kingly Crown had <mark1>on.</mark1><br>
Satan was now at hand, and from his <mark1>seat</mark1><br>
The Monster moving onward came as <mark4>fast</mark4><br>
With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he <mark4>strode.</mark4><br>
Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admir'd, <br>
Admir'd, not fear'd; God and his Son <mark4>except,</mark4><br>
Created thing naught valu'd he nor <mark4>shun'd;</mark4><br>
And with disdainful look thus first <mark1>began.</mark1><br>
<br>
Whence and what art thou, execrable <mark1>shape,</mark1><br>
That dar'st, though grim and terrible, <mark3>advance</mark3><br>
Thy miscreated Front athwart my <mark1>way</mark1><br>
To yonder Gates? through them I mean to <mark4>pass,</mark4><br>
That be assur'd, without leave askt of <mark3>thee:</mark3><br>
Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by <mark3>proof,</mark3><br>
Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of <mark1>Heav'n.</mark1><br>
<br>
To whom the Goblin full of wrauth <mark4>reply'd,</mark4><br>
Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou <mark3>hee,</mark3><br>
Who first broke peace in Heav'n and Faith, till <mark1>then</mark1><br>
Unbrok'n, and in proud rebellious <mark1>Arms</mark1><br>
Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns <mark1>Sons</mark1><br>
Conjur'd against the highest, for which both <mark3>Thou</mark3><br>
And they outcast from God, are here <mark1>condemn'd</mark1><br>
To waste Eternal dayes in woe and <mark1>pain?</mark1><br>
And reck'n'st thou thy self with Spirits of <mark1>Heav'n,</mark1><br>
Hell-doom'd, and breath'st defiance here and <mark4>scorn</mark4><br>
Where I reign King, and to enrage thee <mark1>more,</mark1><br>
Thy King and Lord?   Back to thy <mark1>punishment,</mark1><br>
False fugitive, and to thy speed add <mark1>wings,</mark1><br>
Least with a whip of Scorpions I <mark1>pursue</mark1><br>
Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this <mark4>Dart</mark4><br>
Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt <mark3>before.</mark3><br>
<br>
So spake the grieslie terrour, and in <mark1>shape,</mark1><br>
So speaking and so threatning, grew <mark4>tenfold</mark4><br>
More dreadful and deform: on th' other <mark4>side</mark4><br>
Incenst with indignation Satan <mark1>stood</mark1><br>
Unterrifi'd, and like a Comet <mark4>burn'd,</mark4><br>
That fires the length of Ophiucus <mark4>huge</mark4><br>
In th' Artick Sky, and from his horrid <mark4>hair</mark4><br>
Shakes Pestilence and Warr.   Each at the <mark1>Head</mark1><br>
Level'd his deadly aime; thir fatall <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
No second stroke intend, and such a <mark4>frown</mark4><br>
Each cast at th' other, as when two black <mark1>Clouds</mark1><br>
With Heav'ns Artillery fraught, come rattling <mark1>on</mark1><br>
Over the Caspian, then stand front to <mark4>front</mark4><br>
Hov'ring a space, till Winds the signal <mark3>blow</mark3><br>
To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid <mark1>air:</mark1><br>
So frownd the mighty Combatants, that <mark1>Hell</mark1><br>
Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they <mark1>stood;</mark1><br>
For never but once more was either <mark4>like</mark4><br>
To meet so great a foe: and now great <mark1>deeds</mark1><br>
Had been achiev'd, whereof all Hell had <mark1>rung,</mark1><br>
Had not the Snakie Sorceress that <mark1>sat</mark1><br>
Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal <mark3>Key,</mark3><br>
Ris'n, and with hideous outcry rush'd <mark4>between.</mark4><br>
<br>
O Father, what intends thy hand, she <mark4>cry'd,</mark4><br>
Against thy only Son?   What fury O <mark4>Son,</mark4><br>
Possesses thee to bend that mortal <mark1>Dart</mark1><br>
Against thy Fathers head? and know'st for <mark1>whom;</mark1><br>
For him who sits above and laughs the <mark4>while</mark4><br>
At thee ordain'd his drudge, to <mark4>execute</mark4><br>
What e're his wrath, which he calls justice, <mark4>bids,</mark4><br>
His wrath which one day will destroy ye <mark4>both.</mark4><br>
<br>
She spake, and at her words the hellish <mark4>Pest</mark4><br>
Forbore, then these to her Satan <mark4>return'd:</mark4><br>
<br>
So strange thy outcry, and thy words so <mark4>strange</mark4><br>
Thou interposest, that my sudden <mark1>hand</mark1><br>
Prevented spares to tell thee yet by <mark1>deeds</mark1><br>
What it intends; till first I know of <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
What thing thou art, thus double-form'd, and <mark3>why</mark3><br>
In this infernal Vaile first met thou <mark4>call'st</mark4><br>
Me Father, and that Fantasm ca11'st my <mark1>Son?</mark1><br>
I know thee not, nor ever saw till <mark1>now</mark1><br>
Sight more detestable then him and <mark1>thee.</mark1><br>
<br>
T' whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate <mark1>reply'd;</mark1><br>
Hast thou forgot me then, and do I <mark4>seem</mark4><br>
Now in thine eyes so foul, once deemd so <mark1>fair</mark1><br>
In Heav'n, when at th' Assembly, and in <mark4>sight</mark4><br>
Of all the Seraphim with thee <mark5>combin'd</mark5><br>
In bold conspiracy against Heav'ns <mark1>King,</mark1><br>
All on a sudden miserable <mark1>pain</mark1><br>
Surpris'd thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm <br>
In darkness, while thy head flames thick and <mark1>fast</mark1><br>
Threw forth, till on the left side op'ning <mark1>wide,</mark1><br>
Likest to thee in shape and count'nance <mark4>bright,</mark4><br>
Then shining heav'nly fair, a Goddess <mark1>arm'd</mark1><br>
Out of thy head I sprung: amazement <mark4>seis'd</mark4><br>
All th' Host of Heav'n; back they recoild affraid <br>
At first, and call'd me <mark4>Sin</mark4>, and for a <mark4>Sign</mark4><br>
Portentous held me; but familiar <mark4>grown,</mark4><br>
I pleas'd, and with attractive graces <mark4>won</mark4><br>
The most averse, thee chiefly, who full <mark4>oft</mark4><br>
Thy self in me thy perfect image <mark4>viewing</mark4><br>
Becam'st enamour'd, and such joy thou <mark4>took'st</mark4><br>
With me in secret, that my womb <mark1>conceiv'd</mark1><br>
A growing burden.   Mean while Warr <mark4>arose,</mark4><br>
And fields were fought in Heav'n; wherein <mark5>remaind</mark5><br>
(For what could else) to our Almighty <mark1>Foe</mark1><br>
Cleer Victory, to our part loss and <mark4>rout</mark4><br>
Through all the Empyrean: down they <mark1>fell</mark1><br>
Driv'n headlong from the Pitch of <mark4>Heaven</mark4>, <mark4>down</mark4><br>
Into this Deep, and in the general <mark1>fall</mark1><br>
I also; at which time this powerful <mark1>Key</mark1><br>
Into my hand was giv'n, with charge to <mark4>keep</mark4><br>
These Gates for ever shut, which none can <mark1>pass</mark1><br>
Without my op'ning.   Pensive here I <mark1>sat</mark1><br>
Alone, but long I sat not, till my <mark4>womb</mark4><br>
Pregnant by thee, and now excessive <mark1>grown</mark1><br>
Prodigious motion felt and rueful <mark3>throes.</mark3><br>
At last this odious offspring whom thou <mark5>seest</mark5><br>
Thine own begotten, breaking violent <mark1>way</mark1><br>
Tore through my entrails, that with fear and <mark1>pain</mark1><br>
Distorted, all my nether shape thus <mark3>grew</mark3><br>
Transform'd: but he my inbred enemie <br>
Forth issu'd, brandishing his fatal <mark1>Dart</mark1><br>
Made to destroy: I fled, and cry'd out <mark1>Death;</mark1><br>
Hell trembl'd at the hideous Name, and <mark4>sigh'd</mark4><br>
From all her Caves, and back resounded <mark1>Death.</mark1><br>
I fled, but he pursu'd (though more, it <mark1>seems,</mark1><br>
Inflam'd with lust then rage) and swifter <mark1>far,</mark1><br>
Mee overtook his mother all <mark5>dismaid,</mark5><br>
And in embraces forcible and <mark5>foule</mark5><br>
Ingendring with me, of that rape <mark4>begot</mark4><br>
These yelling Monsters that with ceasless <mark1>cry</mark1><br>
Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly <mark1>conceiv'd</mark1><br>
And hourly born, with sorrow <mark4>infinite</mark4><br>
To me, for when they list into the <mark1>womb</mark1><br>
That bred them they return, and howle and <mark3>gnaw</mark3><br>
My Bowels, thir repast; then bursting <mark1>forth</mark1><br>
A fresh with conscious terrours vex me <mark1>round,</mark1><br>
That rest or intermission none I <mark1>find.</mark1><br>
Before mine eyes in opposition <mark1>sits</mark1><br>
Grim Death my Son and foe, who sets them <mark1>on,</mark1><br>
And me his Parent would full soon <mark4>devour</mark4><br>
For want of other prey, but that he <mark1>knows</mark1><br>
His end with mine involvd; and knows that <mark3>I</mark3><br>
Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his <mark4>bane,</mark4><br>
When ever that shall be; so Fate <mark5>pronounc'd.</mark5><br>
But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, <mark4>shun</mark4><br>
His deadly arrow; neither vainly <mark1>hope</mark1><br>
To be invulnerable in those bright <mark1>Arms,</mark1><br>
Though temper'd heav'nly, for that mortal <mark4>dint,</mark4><br>
Save he who reigns above, none can <mark4>resist.</mark4><br>
<br>
She finish'd, and the suttle Fiend his <mark4>lore</mark4><br>
Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd <mark5>smooth.</mark5><br>
Dear <mark4>Daughter</mark4>, since thou claim'st me for thy <mark1>Sire,</mark1><br>
And my fair Son here showst me, the dear <mark4>pledge</mark4><br>
Of dalliance had with thee in Heav'n, and <mark4>joys</mark4><br>
Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire <mark1>change</mark1><br>
Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, <mark3>know</mark3><br>
I come no enemie, but to set <mark3>free</mark3><br>
From out this dark and dismal house of <mark1>pain,</mark1><br>
Both him and thee, and all the heav'nly <mark4>Host</mark4><br>
Of Spirits that in our just pretenses <mark1>arm'd</mark1><br>
Fell with us from on high: from them I <mark3>go</mark3><br>
This uncouth errand <mark4>sole</mark4>, and one for <mark1>all</mark1><br>
My self expose, with lonely steps to <mark4>tread</mark4><br>
Th' unfounded deep, and through the void <mark4>immense</mark4><br>
To search with wandring quest a place <mark4>foretold</mark4><br>
Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere <mark1>now</mark1><br>
Created vast and round, a place of <mark1>bliss</mark1><br>
In the Pourlieues of Heav'n, and therein <mark5>plac't</mark5><br>
A race of upstart Creatures, to <mark3>supply</mark3><br>
Perhaps our vacant room, though more <mark1>remov'd,</mark1><br>
Least Heav'n surcharg'd with potent <mark4>multitude</mark4><br>
Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or <mark4>aught</mark4><br>
Then this more secret now design'd, I <mark4>haste</mark4><br>
To know, and this once <mark4>known</mark4>, shall soon <mark1>return,</mark1><br>
And bring ye to the place where Thou and <mark1>Death</mark1><br>
Shall dwell at ease, and up and down <mark4>unseen</mark4><br>
Wing silently the buxom Air, <mark5>imbalm'd</mark5><br>
With odours; there ye shall be fed and <mark1>fill'd</mark1><br>
Immeasurably, all things shall be your <mark1>prey.</mark1><br>
He ceas'd, for both seemd highly pleasd, and <mark1>Death</mark1><br>
Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to <mark1>hear</mark1><br>
His famine should be fill'd, and blest his mawe <br>
Destin'd to that good hour: no less <mark5>rejoyc'd</mark5><br>
His mother bad, and thus bespake her <mark1>Sire.</mark1><br>
<br>
The key of this infernal Pit by <mark1>due,</mark1><br>
And by command of Heav'ns all-powerful <mark1>King</mark1><br>
I keep, by him forbidden to <mark4>unlock</mark4><br>
These Adamantine <mark4>Gates</mark4>, against all <mark4>force</mark4><br>
Death ready stands to interpose his <mark1>dart,</mark1><br>
Fearless to be o'rmatcht by living <mark1>might.</mark1><br>
But what ow I to his commands <mark1>above</mark1><br>
Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me <mark1>down</mark1><br>
Into this gloom of Tartarus <mark1>profound,</mark1><br>
To sit in hateful Office here <mark5>confin'd,</mark5><br>
Inhabitant of Heav'n, and <mark4>heav'nlie-born,</mark4><br>
Here in perpetual agonie and <mark1>pain,</mark1><br>
With terrors and with clamors compasst <mark1>round</mark1><br>
Of mine own <mark4>brood</mark4>, that on my bowels <mark4>feed:</mark4><br>
Thou art my Father, thou my Author, <mark1>thou</mark1><br>
My being gav'st me; whom should I <mark3>obey</mark3><br>
But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me <mark4>soon</mark4><br>
To that new world of light and bliss, <mark4>among</mark4><br>
The Gods who live at ease, where I shall <mark1>Reign</mark1><br>
At thy right hand voluptuous, as <mark5>beseems</mark5><br>
Thy daughter and thy darling, without <mark1>end.</mark1><br>
<br>
Thus saying, from her side the fatal <mark1>Key,</mark1><br>
Sad instrument of all our woe, she <mark4>took;</mark4><br>
And towards the Gate rouling her bestial <mark3>train,</mark3><br>
Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up <mark3>drew,</mark3><br>
Which but her self not all the Stygian <mark1>powers</mark1><br>
Could once have mov'd; then in the key-hole <mark4>turns</mark4><br>
Th' intricate wards, and every Bolt and <mark4>Bar</mark4><br>
Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with <mark1>ease</mark1><br>
Unfast'ns: on a sudden op'n <mark5>flie</mark5><br>
With impetuous recoile and jarring <mark1>sound</mark1><br>
Th' infernal dores, and on thir hinges <mark4>grate</mark4><br>
Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom <mark3>shook</mark3><br>
Of Erebus.   She op'nd, but to <mark1>shut</mark1><br>
Excel'd her power; the Gates wide op'n <mark1>stood,</mark1><br>
That with extended wings a Bannerd <mark1>Host</mark1><br>
Under spread Ensigns marching might pass <mark3>through</mark3><br>
With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose <mark3>array;</mark3><br>
So wide they stood, and like a Furnace <mark4>mouth</mark4><br>
Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy <mark4>flame.</mark4><br>
Before thir eyes in sudden view <mark1>appear</mark1><br>
The secrets of the hoarie deep, a <mark1>dark</mark1><br>
Illimitable Ocean without <mark4>bound,</mark4><br>
Without dimension, where length, breadth, & <mark1>highth,</mark1><br>
And time and place are <mark4>lost</mark4>, where eldest <mark1>Night</mark1><br>
And Chaos.   Ancestors of Nature, <mark1>hold</mark1><br>
Eternal Anarchie, amidst the <mark1>noise</mark1><br>
Of endless Warrs, and by confusion <mark1>stand.</mark1><br>
For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions <mark1>fierce</mark1><br>
Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel <mark1>bring</mark1><br>
Thir embryon Atoms; they around the <mark4>flag</mark4><br>
Of each his Faction, in thir several Clanns, <br>
Light-arm'd or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or <mark1>slow,</mark1><br>
Swarm populous, unnumber'd as the <mark4>Sands</mark4><br>
Of Barca or Cyrene's torrid <mark4>soil,</mark4><br>
Levied to side with warring <mark4>Winds</mark4>, and <mark4>poise</mark4><br>
Thir lighter wings.   To whom these most <mark3>adhere,</mark3><br>
Hee rules a moment; Chaos Umpire <mark1>sits,</mark1><br>
And by decision more imbroiles the <mark3>fray</mark3><br>
By which he Reigns: next him high <mark4>Arbiter</mark4><br>
Chance governs all.   Into this wilde <mark1>Abyss,</mark1><br>
The Womb of nature and perhaps her <mark1>Grave,</mark1><br>
Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor <mark4>Air</mark4>, nor <mark1>Fire,</mark1><br>
But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt <br>
Confus'dly, and which thus must ever <mark1>fight,</mark1><br>
Unless th' Almighty Maker them <mark3>ordain</mark3><br>
His dark materials to create more <mark4>Worlds,</mark4><br>
Into this wild Abyss the warie <mark4>fiend</mark4><br>
Stood on the brink of Hell and look'd a <mark1>while,</mark1><br>
Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow <mark4>frith</mark4><br>
He had to cross.   Nor was his eare less <mark4>peal'd</mark4><br>
With noises loud and ruinous (to <mark4>compare</mark4><br>
Great things with small) then when Bellona <mark1>storms,</mark1><br>
With all her battering Engines bent to <mark4>rase</mark4><br>
Som Capital City; or less then if this <mark3>frame</mark3><br>
Of Heav'n were falling, and these <mark4>Elements</mark4><br>
In mutinie had from her Axle <mark4>torn</mark4><br>
The stedfast Earth.   At last his Sail-broad <mark5>Vannes</mark5><br>
He spreads for flight, and in the surging <mark4>smoak</mark4><br>
Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a <mark1>League</mark1><br>
As in a cloudy Chair ascending <mark4>rides</mark4><br>
Audacious, but that seat soon failing, <mark4>meets</mark4><br>
A vast vacuitie: all <mark4>unawares</mark4><br>
Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he <mark4>drops</mark4><br>
Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this <mark1>hour</mark1><br>
Down had been falling, had not by ill <mark1>chance</mark1><br>
The strong rebuff of som tumultuous <mark4>cloud</mark4><br>
Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried <mark4>him</mark4><br>
As many miles aloft: that furie <mark4>stay'd,</mark4><br>
Quencht in a Boggie Syrtis, neither <mark3>Sea,</mark3><br>
Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he <mark4>fares,</mark4><br>
Treading the crude consistence, half on <mark4>foot,</mark4><br>
Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile. <br>
As when a Gryfon through the <mark4>Wilderness</mark4><br>
With winged course ore Hill or moarie <mark4>Dale,</mark4><br>
Pursues the Arimaspian, who by <mark5>stelth</mark5><br>
Had from his wakeful custody <mark5>purloind</mark5><br>
The guarded Gold: So eagerly the <mark1>fiend</mark1><br>
Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or <mark4>rare,</mark4><br>
With head, hands, wings or feet pursues his <mark1>way,</mark1><br>
And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes: <br>
At length a universal hubbub <mark4>wilde</mark4><br>
Of stunning sounds and voices all <mark5>confus'd</mark5><br>
Born through the hollow dark assaults his <mark5>eare</mark5><br>
With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes, <br>
Undaunted to meet there what ever <mark1>power</mark1><br>
Or Spirit of the nethermost <mark1>Abyss</mark1><br>
Might in that noise reside, of whom to <mark4>ask</mark4><br>
Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes <br>
Bordering on light; when strait behold the <mark1>Throne</mark1><br>
Of Chaos, and his dark Pavilion <mark4>spread</mark4><br>
Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron'd <br>
Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of <mark1>things,</mark1><br>
The Consort of his Reign; and by them <mark1>stood</mark1><br>
Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded <mark4>name</mark4><br>
Of Demogorgon; Rumor next and <mark1>Chance,</mark1><br>
And Tumult and Confusion all <mark5>imbroild,</mark5><br>
And Discord with a thousand various <mark4>mouths.</mark4><br>
<br>
T' whom Satan turning boldly, thus. Ye <mark1>Powers</mark1><br>
And Spirits of this nethermost <mark1>Abyss,</mark1><br>
Chaos and ancient Night, I come no <mark3>Spy,</mark3><br>
With purpose to explore or to <mark4>disturb</mark4><br>
The secrets of your Realm, but by <mark4>constraint</mark4><br>
Wandring this darksome Desart, as my <mark1>way,</mark1><br>
Lies through your spacious Empire up to <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
Alone, and without guide, half lost, I <mark1>seek</mark1><br>
What readiest path leads where your gloomie <mark4>bounds</mark4><br>
Confine with Heav'n; or if som other <mark1>place</mark1><br>
From your Dominion won, th' Ethereal <mark1>King</mark1><br>
Possesses lately, thither to <mark1>arrive</mark1><br>
I travel this profound, direct my <mark4>course;</mark4><br>
Directed no mean recompence it <mark4>brings</mark4><br>
To your behoof, if I that Region <mark1>lost,</mark1><br>
All usurpation thence expell'd, <mark1>reduce</mark1><br>
To her original darkness and your <mark3>sway</mark3><br>
(Which is my present journey) and once <mark1>more</mark1><br>
Erect the Standard there of ancient <mark1>Night;</mark1><br>
Yours be th' advantage all, mine the <mark1>revenge.</mark1><br>
<br>
Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch <mark1>old</mark1><br>
With faultring speech and visage <mark5>incompos'd</mark5><br>
Answer'd. I know thee, stranger, who thou <mark4>art,</mark4><br>
That mighty leading Angel, who of <mark1>late</mark1><br>
Made head against Heav'ns King, though <mark3>overthrown.</mark3><br>
I saw and heard, for such a numerous <mark1>Host</mark1><br>
Fled not in silence through the frighted <mark1>deep</mark1><br>
With ruin upon ruin, rout on <mark1>rout,</mark1><br>
Confusion worse confounded; and Heav'n <mark4>Gates</mark4><br>
Pourd out by millions her victorious <mark1>Bands</mark1><br>
Pursuing.   I upon my Frontieres <mark1>here</mark1><br>
Keep residence; if all I can will <mark4>serve,</mark4><br>
That little which is left so to <mark4>defend,</mark4><br>
Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles <br>
Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first <mark1>Hell</mark1><br>
Your dungeon stretching far and wide <mark4>beneath;</mark4><br>
Now lately Heaven and Earth, another <mark1>World</mark1><br>
Hung ore my Realm, link'd in a golden <mark4>Chain</mark4><br>
To that side Heav'n from whence your Legions <mark1>fell:</mark1><br>
If that way be your walk, you have not <mark1>farr;</mark1><br>
So much the neerer danger; go and <mark4>speed;</mark4><br>
Havock and spoil and ruin are my <mark3>gain.</mark3><br>
<br>
He ceas'd; and Satan staid not to <mark1>reply,</mark1><br>
But glad that now his Sea should find a <mark1>shore,</mark1><br>
With fresh alacritie and force <mark4>renew'd</mark4><br>
Springs upward like a Pyramid of <mark1>fire</mark1><br>
Into the wilde expanse, and through the <mark4>shock</mark4><br>
Of fighting Elements, on all sides <mark1>round</mark1><br>
Environ'd wins his way; harder <mark4>beset</mark4><br>
And more <mark4>endanger'd</mark4>, then when Argo <mark4>pass'd</mark4><br>
Through Bosporus betwixt the justling <mark4>Rocks:</mark4><br>
Or when Ulysses on the Larbord <mark5>shunnd</mark5><br>
Charybdis, and by th' other whirlpool <mark5>steard.</mark5><br>
So he with difficulty and labour <mark4>hard</mark4><br>
Mov'd on, with difficulty and labour <mark1>hee;</mark1><br>
But hee once past, soon after when man <mark1>fell,</mark1><br>
Strange alteration!   Sin and Death amain <br>
Following his track, such was the will of <mark1>Heav'n,</mark1><br>
Pav'd after him a broad and beat'n <mark1>way</mark1><br>
Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling <mark1>Gulf</mark1><br>
Tamely endur'd a Bridge of wondrous <mark4>length</mark4><br>
From Hell continu'd reaching th' utmost Orbe <br>
Of this frail World; by which the Spirits <mark4>perverse</mark4><br>
With easie intercourse pass to and <mark3>fro</mark3><br>
To tempt or punish mortals, except <mark1>whom</mark1><br>
God and good Angels guard by special <mark4>grace.</mark4><br>
But now at last the sacred <mark4>influence</mark4><br>
Of light appears, and from the walls of <mark1>Heav'n</mark1><br>
Shoots farr into the bosom of dim <mark1>Night</mark1><br>
A glimmering dawn; here Nature first <mark4>begins</mark4><br>
Her fardest verge, and Chaos to <mark3>retire</mark3><br>
As from her outmost works a brok'd <mark1>foe</mark1><br>
With tumult less and with less hostile <mark4>din,</mark4><br>
That Satan with less toil, and now with <mark1>ease</mark1><br>
Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious <mark1>light</mark1><br>
And like a weather-beaten Vessel <mark4>holds</mark4><br>
Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle <mark1>torn;</mark1><br>
Or in the emptier waste, resembling <mark1>Air,</mark1><br>
Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to <mark4>behold</mark4><br>
Farr off th' Empyreal Heav'n, extended <mark1>wide</mark1><br>
In circuit, undetermind square or <mark1>round,</mark1><br>
With Opal Towrs and Battlements <mark1>adorn'd</mark1><br>
Of living Saphire, once his native <mark1>Seat;</mark1><br>
And fast by hanging in a golden <mark1>Chain</mark1><br>
This pendant world, in bigness as a <mark4>Starr</mark4><br>
Of smallest Magnitude close by the <mark1>Moon.</mark1><br>
Thither full fraught with mischievous <mark1>revenge,</mark1><br>
Accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies.<br>
