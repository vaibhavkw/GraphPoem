Title : Song of the Two Crows <br>
Author : Hayden Carruth <br><br>

I sing of <mark4>Morrisville</mark4><br>
(if you call this <mark3>cry</mark3><br>
a song). <mark3>I</mark3><br>
(if you call this <mark4>painful</mark4><br>
<br>
voice by that great <mark4>name)</mark4><br>
sing the poverty of <mark3>my</mark3><br>
region and <mark4>of</mark4><br>
the wrong end of <mark1>Morrisville.</mark1><br>
<br>
You summer people will <mark3>say</mark3><br>
that all its ends are <mark4>wrong,</mark4><br>
but <mark1>there</mark1>, right <mark1>there,</mark1><br>
the very end of the wrong <mark4>end--</mark4><br>
<br>
a house with windows <mark4>sagging,</mark4><br>
leaning roadward as in <mark4>defense</mark4><br>
or maybe <mark4>defiance</mark4><br>
next to the granite <mark4>ledge,</mark4><br>
<br>
our cliff of broken <mark4>stone</mark4><br>
that shoulders our <mark4>dilapidated</mark4><br>
one-lane iron <mark4>bridge.</mark4><br>
Who lives here? I don't <mark1>know.</mark1><br>
<br>
But they (Hermes reward <mark4>them)</mark4><br>
made this extraordinary <mark4>garden,</mark4><br>
<br>
petunias and nasturtiums <br>
<br>
planted in every crevice and <mark4>all</mark4><br>
the footholds of the <mark4>cliff.</mark4><br>
And <mark4>then</mark4><br>
they painted the <mark4>cliff-face,</mark4><br>
<br>
painted the old <mark4>stone</mark4>, no <mark4>design,</mark4><br>
just swatches of color, <mark4>bold</mark4><br>
rough <mark4>splashes</mark4><br>
irregularly, garish <mark4>orange</mark4><br>
<br>
and livid blue. Is <mark1>it</mark1><br>
fluorescent, do these <mark4>stones</mark4><br>
glow in the <mark4>dark?</mark4><br>
Maybe. I only <mark1>know</mark1><br>
<br>
they glow in the day, <mark3>so</mark3><br>
vivid I stopped my <mark4>car,</mark4><br>
whereupon two <mark4>others</mark4><br>
came inquiring also, <mark3>two</mark3><br>
<br>
crows in the broken spars <br>
of the white pine tree, cawing   <br>
above the <mark4>house.</mark4><br>
Why had those who <mark4>inhabited</mark4><br>
<br>
this corner of <mark1>poverty</mark1><br>
painted the stones? Was <mark1>it</mark1><br>
that the <mark4>flowers</mark4><br>
in living bravery <mark4>nevertheless</mark4><br>
<br>
made too meager a <mark3>show</mark3><br>
for the ruined cliff? Or did <mark3>they</mark3><br>
think to bring <mark4>art</mark4><br>
to nature, somehow to <mark4>improve</mark4><br>
<br>
this corner of <mark4>ugliness?</mark4><br>
For my part I thought <mark3>how</mark3><br>
these <mark4>colors</mark4><br>
were beautiful and yet <mark4>strange</mark4><br>
<br>
in their beauty, ugly <mark1>colors,</mark1><br>
garish orange, livid <mark3>blue;</mark3><br>
        they reminded me <br>
of those Spanish <mark4>cemeteries</mark4><br>
<br>
I saw in New Mexico, <mark4>tin</mark4><br>
mirrors and plastic <mark1>flowers</mark1><br>
in the desert. <mark1>Then</mark1><br>
I knew why the <mark1>stones</mark1><br>
<br>
had been painted: to <mark4>make</mark4><br>
reparation, such as the <mark4>poor</mark4><br>
      might make, whose sorrow   <br>
had been done here, <mark4>this</mark4><br>
<br>
desecration. Is not <mark1>this</mark1><br>
the burden of all poor <mark4>lands</mark4><br>
<br>
the basis of <mark1>poverty?</mark1><br>
<br>
A spoiled land makes <mark4>spoiled</mark4><br>
people. The poor know <mark1>this.</mark1><br>
I <mark4>guess</mark4><br>
the crows know too, because <mark4>off</mark4><br>
<br>
they flew, cawing <mark4>above</mark4><br>
the bridge and the slashed <mark4>hills</mark4><br>
surrounding <mark1>Morrisville.</mark1><br>
I started my car and <mark4>drove</mark4><br>
<br>
out on the iron <mark1>bridge</mark1><br>
which rumbled its <mark4>sullen</mark4><br>
<br>
And I sang as I sing <mark3>now</mark3><br>
<br>
(if you care to call it <mark4>song)</mark4><br>
my people of <mark1>Morrisville</mark1><br>
who <mark4>live</mark4><br>
where all the ends are <mark1>wrong.</mark1><br>
