Title : A Red, Red Rose <br>
Author : Robert Burns <br><br>

O my Luve is like a red, red rose <br>
That's newly sprung in <mark3>June;</mark3><br>
O my Luve is like the melody <br>
That's sweetly played in <mark3>tune.</mark3><br>
<br>
So fair art thou, my bonnie lass, <br>
So deep in luve am <mark3>I;</mark3><br>
And I will luve thee still, my <mark1>dear,</mark1><br>
Till a' the seas gang <mark3>dry.</mark3><br>
<br>
Till a' the seas gang dry, my <mark1>dear,</mark1><br>
And the rocks melt wi' the <mark4>sun;</mark4><br>
I will love thee still, my <mark1>dear,</mark1><br>
While the sands o' life shall <mark3>run.</mark3><br>
<br>
And fare thee weel, my only <mark1>luve!</mark1><br>
And fare thee weel <mark3>awhile!</mark3><br>
And I will come again, my <mark1>luve,</mark1><br>
Though it were ten thousand <mark3>mile.</mark3><br>
