<br>
O Friend! I know not which way I must <mark3>look</mark3><br>
For comfort, being, as I am, opprest,<br>
To think that now our life is only drest<br>
For show; mean handy-work of craftsman, <mark3>cook,</mark3><br>
Or groom! ? We must run glittering like a <mark3>brook</mark3><br>
In the open sunshine, or we are unblest:<br>
The wealthiest man among us is the best:<br>
No grandeur now in nature or in <mark3>book</mark3><br>
Delights us. Rapine, <mark4>avarice</mark4>, <mark4>expense,</mark4><br>
This is idolatry; and these we <mark3>adore:</mark3><br>
Plain living and high thinking are no <mark3>more:</mark3><br>
The homely beauty of the good old <mark3>cause</mark3><br>
Is gone; our <mark4>peace</mark4>, our fearful <mark4>innocence,</mark4><br>
And pure religion breathing household <mark3>laws.</mark3><br>
