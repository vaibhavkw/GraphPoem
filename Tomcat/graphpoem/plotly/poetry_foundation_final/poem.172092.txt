Title : The Ballad of Rudolph Reed <br>
Author : Gwendolyn Brooks <br><br>

Rudolph Reed was <mark5>oaken.</mark5><br>
His wife was oaken <mark3>too.</mark3><br>
And his two good girls and his good little <mark4>man</mark4><br>
Oakened as they <mark3>grew.</mark3><br>
<br>
"I am not hungry for <mark4>berries.</mark4><br>
I am not hungry for <mark3>bread.</mark3><br>
But hungry hungry for a <mark4>house</mark4><br>
Where at night a man in <mark3>bed</mark3><br>
<br>
"May never hear the plaster   <br>
Stir as if in <mark4>pain.</mark4><br>
May never hear the <mark4>roaches</mark4><br>
Falling like fat <mark3>rain.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Where never wife and children <mark4>need</mark4><br>
Go blinking through the <mark3>gloom.</mark3><br>
Where every room of many <mark4>rooms</mark4><br>
Will be full of <mark3>room.</mark3><br>
<br>
"Oh my home may have its east or <mark4>west</mark4><br>
Or north or south behind <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
All I know is I shall know <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
And fight for it when I find <mark1>it."</mark1><br>
<br>
It was in a street of bitter <mark4>white</mark4><br>
That he made his <mark4>application.</mark4><br>
For Rudolph Reed was <mark5>oakener</mark5><br>
Than others in the <mark3>nation.</mark3><br>
<br>
The agent's steep and steady <mark4>stare</mark4><br>
Corroded to a <mark4>grin.</mark4><br>
Why, you black old, tough old hell of a <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
Move your family <mark4>in!</mark4><br>
<br>
Nary a grin grinned Rudolph <mark3>Reed,</mark3><br>
Nary a curse cursed <mark3>he,</mark3><br>
But moved in his House. With his dark little <mark1>wife,</mark1><br>
And his dark little children <mark3>three.</mark3><br>
A neighbor would look, with a yawning eye   <br>
<br>
That squeezed into a <mark4>slit.</mark4><br>
But the Rudolph Reeds and the children <mark1>three</mark1><br>
Were too joyous to notice <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
For were they not firm in a home of their <mark4>own</mark4><br>
<br>
With windows <mark4>everywhere</mark4><br>
And a beautiful banistered <mark4>stair</mark4><br>
And a front yard for flowers and a back yard for <mark4>grass?</mark4><br>
The first night, a rock, big as two <mark4>fists.</mark4><br>
<br>
The second, a rock big as <mark1>three.</mark1><br>
But nary a curse cursed Rudolph <mark1>Reed.</mark1><br>
(Though oaken as man could <mark3>be.)</mark3><br>
The third night, a silvery ring of <mark4>glass.</mark4><br>
<br>
Patience ached to <mark4>endure.</mark4><br>
But he looked, and lo! small Mabel's <mark4>blood</mark4><br>
Was staining her gaze so <mark3>pure.</mark3><br>
Then up did rise our Rudolph <mark1>Reed</mark1><br>
<br>
And pressed the hand of his <mark1>wife,</mark1><br>
And went to the door with a <mark4>thirty-four</mark4><br>
And a beastly butcher <mark3>knife.</mark3><br>
He ran like a mad thing into the <mark4>night.</mark4><br>
<br>
And the words in his mouth were <mark3>stinking.</mark3><br>
By the time he had hurt his first white <mark1>man</mark1><br>
He was no longer <mark3>thinking.</mark3><br>
By the time he had hurt his fourth white <mark1>man</mark1><br>
<br>
Rudolph Reed was <mark4>dead.</mark4><br>
His neighbors gathered and kicked his <mark4>corpse.</mark4><br>
"Nigger--" his neighbors <mark3>said.</mark3><br>
Small Mabel whimpered all night <mark4>long,</mark4><br>
<br>
For calling herself the <mark4>cause.</mark4><br>
Her oak-eyed mother did no <mark4>thing</mark4><br>
But change the bloody <mark3>gauze.</mark3><br>
