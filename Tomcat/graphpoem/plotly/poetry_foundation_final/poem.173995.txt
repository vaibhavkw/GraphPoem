Title : from At a Vacation Exercise <br>
Author : John Milton <br><br>

Hail native language, that by sinews <mark3>weak</mark3><br>
Didst move my first endeavouring tongue to <mark3>speak,</mark3><br>
And mad'st imperfect words with childish <mark3>trips,</mark3><br>
Half unpronounc'd, slide through my infant <mark3>lips,</mark3><br>
Driving dumb Silence from the portal <mark3>door,</mark3><br>
Where he had mutely sate two years <mark3>before:</mark3><br>
Here I salute thee and thy pardon <mark4>ask,</mark4><br>
That now I use thee in my latter <mark3>task:</mark3><br>
Small loss it is that thence can come unto <mark1>thee,</mark1><br>
I know my tongue but little grace can do <mark1>thee:</mark1><br>
Thou needst not be ambitious to be <mark3>first,</mark3><br>
Believe me I have thither pack'd the <mark3>worst:</mark3><br>
And, if it happen as I did <mark4>forecast,</mark4><br>
The daintest dishes shall be serv'd up <mark4>last.</mark4><br>
I pray thee then deny me not thy <mark3>aid</mark3><br>
For this same small neglect that I have <mark3>made:</mark3><br>
But haste thee straight to do me once a <mark3>pleasure,</mark3><br>
And from thy wardrobe bring thy chiefest <mark3>treasure;</mark3><br>
Not those new-fangled toys, and trimming <mark4>slight</mark4><br>
Which takes our late fantastics with <mark3>delight,</mark3><br>
But cull those richest robes, and gay'st <mark4>attire</mark4><br>
Which deepest spirits, and choicest wits <mark3>desire.</mark3><br>
I have some naked thoughts that rove <mark4>about</mark4><br>
And loudly knock to have their passage <mark3>out;</mark3><br>
And weary of their place do only <mark3>stay</mark3><br>
Till thou hast deck'd them in thy best <mark3>array;</mark3><br>
That so they may without suspect or <mark3>fears</mark3><br>
Fly swiftly to this fair assembly's <mark3>ears.</mark3><br>
Yet I had rather, if I were to <mark4>choose,</mark4><br>
Thy service in some graver subject <mark3>use,</mark3><br>
Such as may make thee search thy coffers <mark4>round,</mark4><br>
Before thou clothe my fancy in fit <mark3>sound:</mark3><br>
Such where the deep transported mind may <mark3>soar</mark3><br>
Above the wheeling poles, and at heav'n's <mark1>door</mark1><br>
Look in, and see each blissful <mark4>deity</mark4><br>
How he before the thunderous throne doth lie, <br>
Listening to what unshorn Apollo <mark4>sings</mark4><br>
To th'touch of golden <mark4>wires</mark4>, while Hebe <mark3>brings</mark3><br>
Immortal nectar to her kingly <mark3>sire;</mark3><br>
Then passing through the spheres of watchful <mark3>fire,</mark3><br>
And misty regions of wide air next <mark4>under,</mark4><br>
And hills of snow and lofts of piled <mark3>thunder,</mark3><br>
May tell at length how green-ey'd Neptune <mark4>raves,</mark4><br>
In heav'n's defiance mustering all his <mark3>waves;</mark3><br>
Then sing of secret things that came to <mark4>pass</mark4><br>
When beldam Nature in her cradle <mark4>was;</mark4><br>
And last of kings and queens and heroes <mark4>old,</mark4><br>
Such as the wise Demodocus once <mark3>told</mark3><br>
In solemn songs at king Alcinous' <mark4>feast,</mark4><br>
While sad Ulysses' soul and all the <mark4>rest</mark4><br>
Are held with his melodious <mark4>harmony</mark4><br>
In willing chains and sweet <mark4>captivity.</mark4><br>
