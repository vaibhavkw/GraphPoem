Title : Tritina for Susannah <br>
Author : David Yezzi <br><br>

The water off these rocks is green and <mark4>cold.</mark4><br>
The sandless coast takes the tide in its <mark1>mouth,</mark1><br>
as a wolf brings down a deer or lifts its <mark4>child.</mark4><br>
<br>
I walked this bay before you were my <mark1>child.</mark1><br>
Your fingers stinging brightly in the <mark1>cold,</mark1><br>
I take each one and warm it in my <mark1>mouth.</mark1><br>
<br>
Though I've known this shore for years, my <mark1>mouth</mark1><br>
holds no charms of use to you, my <mark1>child.</mark1><br>
You will have to learn the words to ward off <mark1>cold</mark1><br>
<br>
and know them cold, child, in your open <mark1>mouth.</mark1><br>
