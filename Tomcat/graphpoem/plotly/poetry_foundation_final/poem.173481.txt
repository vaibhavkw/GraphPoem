Title : Written on a Wall at Woodstock <br>
Author : Queen Elizabeth I <br><br>

Oh Fortune, thy wresting wavering <mark4>state</mark4><br>
Hath fraught with cares my troubled <mark4>wit,</mark4><br>
Whose witness this present prison <mark4>late</mark4><br>
Could bear, where once was joy's loan <mark4>quit.</mark4><br>
Thou causedst the guilty to be <mark4>loosed</mark4><br>
From bands where innocents were inclosed,<br>
And caused the guiltless to be <mark3>reserved,</mark3><br>
And freed those that death had well <mark3>deserved.</mark3><br>
But all herein can be nothing <mark4>wrought,</mark4><br>
So God send to my foes all they have <mark3>thought.</mark3><br>
