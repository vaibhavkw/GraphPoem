Title : Full Flight <br>
Author : Bob Hicok <br><br>

I'm in a plane that will not be flown into a <mark4>building.</mark4><br>
It's a SAAB 340, seats 40, has two engines with <mark4>propellers</mark4><br>
is why I think of beanies, those hats that would <mark4>spin</mark4><br>
a young head into the clouds. The plane is red and <mark4>loud</mark4><br>
inside like it must be loud in the heart, red like <mark4>fire</mark4><br>
and fire engines and the woman two seats up and to the <mark4>right</mark4><br>
resembles one of the widows I saw on TV after the <mark4>Towers</mark4><br>
came down. It's her hair that I recognize, the fecundity of <mark4>it</mark4><br>
and the color and its obedience to an ideal, the <mark4>shape</mark4><br>
it was asked several hours ago to hold and has <mark4>held</mark4>, a <mark4>kind</mark4><br>
of wave that begins at the forehead and repeats with <mark4>slight</mark4><br>
variations all the way to the tips, as if she were <mark4>water</mark4><br>
and a pebble had been continuously dropped into the mouth<br>
of her existence. We are eighteen thousand feet over <mark5>America.</mark5><br>
People are typing at their laps, blowing across the fog of <mark4>coffee,</mark4><br>
sleeping with their heads on the windows, on the <mark4>pattern</mark4><br>
of green fields and brown <mark4>fields</mark4>, streams and gas <mark4>stations</mark4><br>
and swimming pools, blue dots of aquamarine that <mark4>suggest</mark4><br>
we've domesticated the mirage. We had to kill <mark4>someone,</mark4><br>
I believe, when the metal bones burned and the <mark4>top</mark4><br>
fell through the bottom and a cloud made of dust and <mark4>memos</mark4><br>
and skin muscled across Manhattan. I remember <mark4>feeling</mark4><br>
I could finally touch a rifle, that some <mark4>murders</mark4><br>
are an illumination of ethics, that they act as a <mark4>word,</mark4><br>
a motion the brain requires for which there <mark4>is</mark4><br>
no syllable, no breath. The moment the planes had <mark4>stopped,</mark4><br>
when we were afraid of the sky, there was a <mark4>pause</mark4><br>
when we could have been perfectly <mark4>American,</mark4><br>
could have spent infinity dollars and thrown a <mark4>million</mark4><br>
bodies at finding the few, lasering our revenge<br>
into a kind of love, the blood-hunger kept <mark4>exact</mark4><br>
and more convincing for its <mark4>precision</mark4>, an <mark4>expression</mark4><br>
of our belief that proximity is never the measure of <mark4>guilt.</mark4><br>
We've lived in the sky again for some years and today<br>
on my lap these pictures from Iraq, naked <mark4>bodies</mark4><br>
stacked into a pyramid of ha-ha and the <mark4>articles</mark4><br>
about broomsticks up the ass and the limbs of <mark4>children</mark4><br>
turned into stubble, we are punch-drunk and getting <mark4>even</mark4><br>
with the sand, with the map, with oil, with <mark4>ourselves</mark4><br>
I think listening to the guys behind me. There's a <mark5>problem</mark5><br>
in Alpena with an inventory control system, some <mark4>switches</mark4><br>
are being counted twice, switches for what I don't know--<br>
switches of humor, of faith--but the men are musical<br>
in their jargon, both likely born in New <mark4>Delhi</mark4><br>
and probably Americans now, which is what the flesh<br>
of this country has been, a grafted pulse, an <mark4>inventory</mark4><br>
of the world, and just as the idea of embrace<br>
moves chemically into my <mark4>blood</mark4>, and I'm <mark4>warmed</mark4><br>
as if I've just taken a drink, a voice <mark4>announces</mark4><br>
we've begun our descent, and then I sense the <mark4>falling.</mark4><br>
