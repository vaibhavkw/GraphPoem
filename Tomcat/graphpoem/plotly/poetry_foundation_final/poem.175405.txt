Title : Upon Wedlock, and Death of Children <br>
Author : Edward Taylor <br><br>

A Curious Knot God made in <mark4>Paradise,</mark4><br>
      And drew it out inamled neatly Fresh. <br>
It was the True-Love Knot, more sweet than <mark4>spice</mark4><br>
And set with all the flowres of Graces <mark4>dress.</mark4><br>
      Its Weddens Knot, that ne're can be unti'de. <br>
No Alexanders Sword can it <mark4>divide.</mark4><br>
<br>
The slips here planted, gay and glorious <mark3>grow:</mark3><br>
Unless an Hellish breath do sindge their <mark3>Plumes.</mark3><br>
Here Primrose, Cowslips, Roses, Lilies <mark3>blow</mark3><br>
With Violets and Pinkes that voide <mark3>perfumes.</mark3><br>
Whose beautious leaves ore laid with Hony <mark3>Dew.</mark3><br>
And Chanting birds Cherp out sweet Musick <mark3>true.</mark3><br>
<br>
When in this Knot I planted was, my <mark4>Stock</mark4><br>
Soon knotted, and a manly flower out <mark4>brake.</mark4><br>
And after it my branch again did <mark4>knot</mark4><br>
Brought out another Flowre its sweet breath'd <mark4>mate.</mark4><br>
One knot gave one tother the tothers <mark4>place.</mark4><br>
Whence Checkling smiles fought in each others <mark3>face.</mark3><br>
<br>
But oh! a glorious hand from glory <mark3>came</mark3><br>
      Guarded with Angells, soon did Crop this flowere <br>
Which almost tore the root up of the <mark3>same</mark3><br>
      At that unlookt for, Dolesome, darksome houre. <br>
In Pray're to Christ perfum'de it did <mark4>ascend,</mark4><br>
And Angells bright did it to heaven <mark3>tend.</mark3><br>
<br>
But pausing on't, this sweet perfum'd my <mark4>thought,</mark4><br>
Christ would in Glory have a Flowre, Choice, <mark4>Prime,</mark4><br>
<br>
And having Choice, chose this my branch forth <mark3>brought.</mark3><br>
Lord, take't. I thanke thee, thou takst ought of <mark3>mine,</mark3><br>
It is my pledg in glory, part of <mark3>mee</mark3><br>
Is now in it, Lord, glorifi'de with <mark3>thee.</mark3><br>
<br>
But praying ore my branch, my branch did <mark4>sprout</mark4><br>
And bore another manly flower, and <mark3>gay</mark3><br>
And after that another, sweet brake <mark3>out,</mark3><br>
The which the former hand soon got <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
But oh! the tortures, Vomit, screechings, <mark4>groans,</mark4><br>
And six weeks fever would pierce hearts like <mark3>stones.</mark3><br>
<br>
Griefe o're doth flow: and nature fault would finde <br>
Were not thy Will, my Spell, Charm, Joy, and <mark4>Gem:</mark4><br>
That as I said, I say, take, Lord, they're <mark3>thine.</mark3><br>
I piecemeale pass to Glory bright in <mark3>them.</mark3><br>
In joy, may I sweet Flowers for Glory <mark4>breed,</mark4><br>
Whether thou getst them green, or lets them <mark3>seed.</mark3><br>
