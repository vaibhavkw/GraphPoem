Title : The World <br>
Author : Henry Vaughan <br><br>

I saw Eternity the other <mark3>night,</mark3><br>
Like a great ring of pure and endless <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
All calm, as it was <mark3>bright;</mark3><br>
And round beneath it, Time in hours, <mark4>days</mark4>, <mark4>years,</mark4><br>
Driv'n by the <mark3>spheres</mark3><br>
Like a vast shadow mov'd; in which the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
And all her train were <mark4>hurl'd.</mark4><br>
The doting lover in his quaintest <mark3>strain</mark3><br>
Did there <mark3>complain;</mark3><br>
Near him, his lute, his fancy, and his <mark3>flights,</mark3><br>
Wit's sour <mark3>delights,</mark3><br>
With gloves, and knots, the silly snares of <mark3>pleasure,</mark3><br>
Yet his dear <mark3>treasure</mark3><br>
All scatter'd lay, while he his eyes did pour<br>
Upon a <mark4>flow'r.</mark4><br>
<br>
The darksome statesman hung with weights and <mark3>woe,</mark3><br>
Like a thick midnight-fog mov'd there so <mark3>slow,</mark3><br>
He did not stay, nor <mark3>go;</mark3><br>
Condemning thoughts (like sad eclipses) <mark4>scowl</mark4><br>
Upon his <mark4>soul,</mark4><br>
And clouds of crying witnesses <mark4>without</mark4><br>
Pursued him with one <mark3>shout.</mark3><br>
Yet digg'd the mole, and lest his ways be <mark4>found,</mark4><br>
Work'd under <mark3>ground,</mark3><br>
Where he did clutch his prey; but one did <mark3>see</mark3><br>
That <mark4>policy;</mark4><br>
Churches and altars fed him; perjuries<br>
Were gnats and <mark4>flies;</mark4><br>
It rain'd about him blood and tears, but <mark3>he</mark3><br>
Drank them as <mark3>free.</mark3><br>
<br>
The fearful miser on a heap of <mark4>rust</mark4><br>
Sate pining all his life there, did scarce <mark3>trust</mark3><br>
His own hands with the <mark3>dust,</mark3><br>
Yet would not place one piece above, but <mark4>lives</mark4><br>
In fear of <mark4>thieves;</mark4><br>
Thousands there were as frantic as himself,<br>
       And hugg'd each one his pelf;<br>
The downright epicure plac'd heav'n in <mark4>sense,</mark4><br>
       And scorn'd pretence,<br>
While others, slipp'd into a wide <mark4>excess,</mark4><br>
Said little <mark3>less;</mark3><br>
The weaker sort slight, trivial wares <mark3>enslave,</mark3><br>
Who think them <mark3>brave;</mark3><br>
And poor despised Truth sate counting by<br>
Their <mark4>victory.</mark4><br>
<br>
Yet some, who all this while did weep and <mark3>sing,</mark3><br>
And sing, and weep, soar'd up into the <mark3>ring;</mark3><br>
But most would use no <mark3>wing.</mark3><br>
O fools (said I) thus to prefer dark <mark1>night</mark1><br>
Before true <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
To live in grots and caves, and hate the <mark3>day</mark3><br>
Because it shews the <mark3>way,</mark3><br>
The way, which from this dead and dark <mark4>abode</mark4><br>
Leads up to <mark4>God,</mark4><br>
A way where you might tread the sun, and <mark4>be</mark4><br>
More bright than <mark1>he.</mark1><br>
But as I did their madness so <mark4>discuss</mark4><br>
One whisper'd <mark3>thus,</mark3><br>
"This ring the Bridegroom did for none <mark4>provide,</mark4><br>
But for his <mark3>bride."</mark3><br>
