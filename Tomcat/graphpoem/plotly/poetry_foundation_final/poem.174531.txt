Title : Advice to the Grub Street Verse-writers <br>
Author : Jonathan Swift <br><br>

Ye poets ragged and <mark3>forlorn,</mark3><br>
Down from your garrets <mark3>haste;</mark3><br>
Ye rhymers, dead as soon as <mark3>born,</mark3><br>
Not yet consign'd to <mark3>paste;</mark3><br>
<br>
I know a trick to make you <mark3>thrive;</mark3><br>
O, 'tis a quaint <mark3>device:</mark3><br>
Your still-born poems shall <mark3>revive,</mark3><br>
And scorn to wrap up <mark3>spice.</mark3><br>
<br>
Get all your verses printed <mark3>fair,</mark3><br>
Then let them well be <mark3>dried;</mark3><br>
And Curll must have a special <mark3>care</mark3><br>
To leave the margin <mark3>wide.</mark3><br>
<br>
Lend these to paper-sparing <mark4>Pope;</mark4><br>
And when he sets to <mark4>write,</mark4><br>
No letter with an <mark4>envelope</mark4><br>
Could give him more <mark3>delight.</mark3><br>
<br>
When Pope has fill'd the margins <mark4>round,</mark4><br>
Why then recall your <mark4>loan;</mark4><br>
Sell them to Curll for fifty <mark3>pound,</mark3><br>
And swear they are your <mark3>own.</mark3><br>
