Title : Thoughts on One's Head <br>
Author : William Meredith <br><br>

(In Plaster, with a Bronze Wash)<br>
A person is very self-conscious about his <mark3>head.</mark3><br>
It makes one nervous just to know it is <mark3>cast</mark3><br>
In enduring materials, and that when the real one is <mark3>dead</mark3><br>
The cast one, if nobody drops it or melts it down, will <mark3>last.</mark3><br>
<br>
We pay more attention to the front end, where the face <mark3>is,</mark3><br>
Than to the interesting and involute interior: <br>
The Fissure of Rolando and such queer <mark3>places</mark3><br>
Are parks for the passions and fears and mild hysteria. <br>
<br>
The things that go on there! Erotic movies are <mark3>shown</mark3><br>
To anyone not accompanied by an <mark4>adult.</mark4><br>
The marquee out front maintains a superior <mark3>tone:</mark3><br>
Documentaries on Sharks and The Japanese Tea <mark3>Cult.</mark3><br>
<br>
The fronts of some heads are extravagantly <mark3>pretty.</mark3><br>
These are the females. Men sometimes blow their <mark3>tops</mark3><br>
About them, launch triremes, sack a whole <mark3>city.</mark3><br>
The female head is mounted on rococo <mark3>props.</mark3><br>
<br>
Judgment is in the head somewhere; it keeps <mark4>sums</mark4><br>
Of pleasure and pain and gives belated <mark3>warning;</mark3><br>
This is the first place everybody <mark3>comes</mark3><br>
With bills, complaints, writs, summons, in the <mark3>morning.</mark3><br>
<br>
This particular head, to my certain <mark3>knowledge</mark3><br>
Has been taught to read and write, make love and <mark4>money,</mark4><br>
Operate cars and airplanes, teach in a <mark3>college,</mark3><br>
And tell involved jokes, some few extremely <mark3>funny.</mark3><br>
<br>
It was further taught to know and to eschew   <br>
Error and sin, which it does <mark4>erratically.</mark4><br>
This is the place the soul calls home just now.   <br>
One dislikes it of course: it is the seat of Me.<br>
