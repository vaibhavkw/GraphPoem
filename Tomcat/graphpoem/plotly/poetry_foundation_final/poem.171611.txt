Title : The Search Party <br>
Author : William Matthews <br><br>

I wondered if the others <mark4>felt</mark4><br>
as <mark4>heroic</mark4><br>
and as safe: my unmangled <mark4>family</mark4><br>
slept while I slid uncertain feet <mark4>ahead</mark4><br>
behind my flashlight's beam. <br>
<mark4>Stones</mark4>, thick roots as twisted <mark4>as</mark4><br>
a ruined <mark4>body,</mark4><br>
what did I <mark4>fear?</mark4><br>
I hoped my <mark4>batteries</mark4><br>
had eight more <mark4>lives</mark4><br>
than the lost <mark4>child.</mark4><br>
I feared I'd find <mark4>something.</mark4><br>
<br>
Reader, by now you must be <mark4>sure</mark4><br>
you know just where we <mark4>are,</mark4><br>
deep in symbolic <mark4>woods.</mark4><br>
Irony, self-accusation,   <br>
someone else's <mark4>suffering.</mark4><br>
The search is that of <mark4>art.</mark4><br>
<br>
You're wrong, though <mark4>it's</mark4><br>
an intelligent <mark4>mistake.</mark4><br>
There was a real lost <mark1>child.</mark1><br>
I don't want to swaddle <mark4>it</mark4><br>
in <mark4>metaphor.</mark4><br>
I'm just a <mark4>journalist</mark4><br>
who can't believe in <mark4>objectivity.</mark4><br>
I'm in these <mark4>poems</mark4><br>
because I'm in my <mark1>life.</mark1><br>
But I <mark4>digress.</mark4><br>
A man four <mark4>volunteers</mark4><br>
to the left of me   <br>
made the <mark4>discovery.</mark4><br>
<br>
We circled in like <mark4>waves</mark4><br>
returning to the parent <mark4>shock.</mark4><br>
You've read this far, you might as <mark4>well</mark4><br>
have been there too. Your eyes <mark4>accuse</mark4><br>
me of false chase. Come off <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
you're the one who thought it <mark4>wouldn't</mark4><br>
matter what we <mark4>found.</mark4><br>
Though we came with <mark4>lights</mark4><br>
and tongues thick in our <mark4>heads,</mark4><br>
the issue was a human <mark1>life.</mark1><br>
The child was <mark4>still</mark4><br>
alive. Admit you're <mark4>glad.</mark4><br>
