Title : Chez Jane<br>
Author : Frank O'Hara<br><br>

The white chocolate jar full of <mark4>petals</mark4><br>
swills odds and ends around in a dizzying eye   <br>
of four o'clocks now and to come. The tiger,   <br>
marvellously striped and irritable, <mark4>leaps</mark4><br>
on the table and without disturbing a <mark3>hair</mark3><br>
of the flowers' breathless attention, <mark4>pisses</mark4><br>
into the <mark4>pot</mark4>, right down its delicate <mark4>spout.</mark4><br>
A whisper of steam goes up from that <mark4>porcelain</mark4><br>
urethra. "Saint-Saens!" it seems to be <mark4>whispering,</mark4><br>
curling unerringly around the furry <mark4>nuts</mark4><br>
of the terrible puss, who is mentally <mark4>flexing.</mark4><br>
Ah be with me always, spirit of noisy   <br>
contemplation in the studio, the <mark4>Garden</mark4><br>
of <mark4>Zoos</mark4>, the eternally fixed <mark4>afternoons!</mark4><br>
There, while music scratches its scrofulous   <br>
stomach, the brute beast emerges and <mark4>stands,</mark4><br>
clear and <mark4>careful</mark4>, knowing always the exact <mark4>peril</mark4><br>
at this moment caressing his fangs with   <br>
a tongue given wholly to luxurious <mark4>usages;</mark4><br>
which only a moment before dropped <mark4>aspirin</mark4><br>
in this sunset of roses, and now throws a <mark3>chair</mark3><br>
in the air to aggravate the truly <mark4>menacing.</mark4><br>
