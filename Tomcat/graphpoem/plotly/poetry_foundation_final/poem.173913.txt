Title : Sir Humphrey Gilbert <br>
Author : Henry Wadsworth Longfellow <br><br>

Southward with fleet of <mark1>ice</mark1><br>
Sailed the corsair <mark3>Death;</mark3><br>
Wild and gast blew the <mark4>blast,</mark4><br>
And the east-wind was his <mark3>breath.</mark3><br>
<br>
His lordly ships of <mark1>ice</mark1><br>
Glisten in the <mark3>sun;</mark3><br>
On each <mark3>side</mark3>, like pennons <mark3>wide,</mark3><br>
Flashing crystal streamlets <mark3>run.</mark3><br>
<br>
His sails of white <mark4>sea-mist</mark4><br>
Dripped with silver <mark4>rain;</mark4><br>
But where he passed there were <mark4>cast</mark4><br>
Leaden shadows o'er the <mark3>main.</mark3><br>
<br>
Eastward from Campobello <br>
Sir Humphrey Gilbert <mark4>sailed;</mark4><br>
Three days or more seaward he <mark3>bore,</mark3><br>
Then, alas! the land-wind <mark3>failed.</mark3><br>
<br>
Alas! the land-wind <mark1>failed,</mark1><br>
And ice-cold grew the <mark4>night;</mark4><br>
And <mark4>nevermore</mark4>, on sea or <mark3>shore,</mark3><br>
Should Sir Humphrey see the <mark3>light.</mark3><br>
<br>
He sat upon the <mark4>deck,</mark4><br>
The Book was in his <mark4>hand;</mark4><br>
"Do not fear! Heaven is as <mark4>near,"</mark4><br>
He <mark4>said</mark4>, "by water as by <mark3>land!"</mark3><br>
<br>
In the first watch of the <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
Without a signal's <mark4>sound,</mark4><br>
Out of the sea, mysteriously, <br>
The fleet of Death rose all <mark3>around.</mark3><br>
<br>
The moon and the evening <mark4>star</mark4><br>
Were hanging in the <mark3>shrouds;</mark3><br>
Every <mark3>mast</mark3>, as it <mark4>passed,</mark4><br>
Seemed to rake the passing <mark3>clouds.</mark3><br>
<br>
They grappled with their <mark4>prize,</mark4><br>
At midnight black and <mark4>cold!</mark4><br>
As of a rock was the <mark4>shock;</mark4><br>
Heavily the ground-swell <mark3>rolled.</mark3><br>
<br>
Southward through day and <mark4>dark,</mark4><br>
They drift in cold <mark4>embrace,</mark4><br>
With mist and <mark3>rain</mark3>, o'er the open <mark1>main;</mark1><br>
Yet there seems no change of <mark3>place.</mark3><br>
<br>
<mark1>Southward</mark1>, forever <mark4>southward,</mark4><br>
They drift through dark and <mark3>day;</mark3><br>
And like a <mark4>dream</mark4>, in the <mark4>Gulf-Stream</mark4><br>
Sinking, vanish all <mark3>away.</mark3><br>
