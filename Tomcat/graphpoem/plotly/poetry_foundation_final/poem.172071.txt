Title : The Circus Animals' Desertion <br>
Author : William Butler Yeats <br><br>

<br>
I sought a theme and sought for it in <mark4>vain,</mark4><br>
I sought it daily for six weeks or <mark3>so.</mark3><br>
Maybe at last being but a broken <mark4>man</mark4><br>
I must be satisfied with my heart, <mark3>although</mark3><br>
Winter and summer till old age <mark3>began</mark3><br>
My circus animals were all on <mark3>show,</mark3><br>
Those stilted boys, that burnished <mark4>chariot,</mark4><br>
Lion and woman and the Lord knows <mark4>what.</mark4><br>
What can I but enumerate old <mark4>themes,</mark4><br>
<br>
First that sea-rider Oisin led by the <mark4>nose</mark4><br>
<br>
Through three enchanted <mark4>islands</mark4>, allegorical <mark4>dreams,</mark4><br>
Vain gaiety, vain battle, vain <mark4>repose,</mark4><br>
Themes of the embittered heart, or so it <mark4>seems,</mark4><br>
That might adorn old songs or courtly <mark4>shows;</mark4><br>
But what cared I that set him on to <mark3>ride,</mark3><br>
I, starved for the bosom of his fairy <mark3>bride.</mark3><br>
And then a counter-truth filled out its <mark3>play,</mark3><br>
`The Countess Cathleen' was the name I gave <mark4>it,</mark4><br>
<br>
She, pity-crazed, had given her soul <mark3>away</mark3><br>
But masterful Heaven had intervened to save <mark1>it.</mark1><br>
I thought my dear must her own soul destroy <br>
So did fanaticism and hate enslave <mark1>it,</mark1><br>
And this brought forth a dream and soon enough <br>
This dream itself had all my thought and <mark1>love.</mark1><br>
And when the Fool and Blind Man stole the <mark4>bread</mark4><br>
Cuchulain fought the ungovernable <mark3>sea;</mark3><br>
<br>
Heart mysteries there, and yet when all is <mark3>said</mark3><br>
It was the dream itself enchanted <mark3>me:</mark3><br>
Character isolated by a <mark4>deed</mark4><br>
To engross the present and dominate memory. <br>
Players and painted stage took all my <mark1>love</mark1><br>
And not those things that they were emblems <mark3>of.</mark3><br>
Those masterful images because <mark4>complete</mark4><br>
Grew in pure mind but out of what <mark1>began?</mark1><br>
<br>
A mound of refuse or the sweepings of a <mark3>street,</mark3><br>
<br>
Old kettles, old bottles, and a broken <mark3>can,</mark3><br>
Old iron, old bones, old rags, that raving <mark4>slut</mark4><br>
Who keeps the till. Now that my ladder's <mark4>gone</mark4><br>
I must lie down where all the ladders <mark4>start</mark4><br>
In the foul rag and bone shop of the <mark3>heart.</mark3><br>
