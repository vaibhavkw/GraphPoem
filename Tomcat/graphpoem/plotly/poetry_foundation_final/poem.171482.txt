Title : Troop Train <br>
Author : Karl Shapiro <br><br>

It stops the town we come through. Workers <mark4>raise</mark4><br>
Their oily arms in good salute and <mark4>grin.</mark4><br>
Kids scream as at a circus. Business <mark4>men</mark4><br>
Glance hopefully and go their measured way. <br>
And women standing at their dumbstruck <mark3>door</mark3><br>
More slowly wave and seem to warn us <mark4>back,</mark4><br>
As if a tear blinding the course of <mark3>war</mark3><br>
Might once dissolve our iron in their sweet wish.<br>
<br>
Fruit of the world, O clustered on <mark4>ourselves</mark4><br>
We hang as from a cornucopia<br>
In total friendliness, with faces <mark4>bunched</mark4><br>
To spray the streets with catcalls and with leers. <br>
A bottle smashes on the moving <mark4>ties</mark4><br>
And eyes fixed on a lady smiling <mark4>pink</mark4><br>
Stretch like a rubber-band and snap and sting <br>
The mouth that wants the drink-of-water <mark4>kiss.</mark4><br>
<br>
And on through crummy continents and <mark4>days,</mark4><br>
Deliberate, grimy, slightly drunk we <mark3>crawl,</mark3><br>
The good-bad boys of circumstance and <mark4>chance,</mark4><br>
Whose bucket-helmets bang the empty <mark3>wall</mark3><br>
Where twist the murdered bodies of our <mark4>packs</mark4><br>
Next to the guns that only seem <mark4>themselves.</mark4><br>
And distance like a strap adjusted <mark4>shrinks,</mark4><br>
Tightens across the shoulder and holds firm.<br>
<br>
Here is a deck of cards; out of this hand <br>
Dealer, deal me my luck, a pair of <mark4>bulls,</mark4><br>
The right draw to a flush, the one-eyed <mark4>jack.</mark4><br>
Diamonds and hearts are red but spades are <mark3>black,</mark3><br>
And spades are spades and clubs are clovers?black. <br>
But deal me winners, souvenirs of <mark4>peace.</mark4><br>
This stands to reason and <mark4>arithmetic,</mark4><br>
Luck also travels and not all come <mark1>back.</mark1><br>
<br>
Trains lead to ships and ships to death or <mark4>trains,</mark4><br>
And trains to death or trucks, and trucks to <mark1>death,</mark1><br>
Or trucks lead to the march, the march to <mark1>death,</mark1><br>
Or that survival which is all our hope;<br>
And death leads back to trucks and trains and <mark4>ships,</mark4><br>
But life leads to the march, O flag! at <mark4>last</mark4><br>
The place of life found after trains and <mark1>death?</mark1><br>
Nightfall of nations brilliant after <mark1>war.</mark1><br>
