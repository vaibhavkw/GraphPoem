Title : The Lie <br>
Author : Anne Waldman <br><br>

Art begins with a <mark3>lie</mark3><br>
      The separation is you plus me plus what we make   <br>
Look into lightbulb, blink, sun's in your <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
<br>
I want a rare <mark3>sky</mark3><br>
vantage point free from <mark4>misconception</mark4><br>
Art begins with a <mark1>lie</mark1><br>
<br>
Nothing to <mark4>lose</mark4>, spontaneous <mark4>rise</mark4><br>
      of reflection, paint the picture <br>
of a lightbulb, or eye the <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
<br>
How to fuel the world, then <mark3>die</mark3><br>
      Distance yourself from artfulness   <br>
How? Art begins with a <mark1>lie</mark1><br>
<br>
The audience wants to <mark3>cry</mark3><br>
      when the actors are real & passionate <br>
Look into footlight, then feed back to <mark1>eye</mark1><br>
<br>
You fluctuate in an artful <mark4>body</mark4><br>
You try to imitate the world's <mark4>glory</mark4><br>
Art begins with a <mark1>lie</mark1><br>
That's the story, sharp speck in the <mark1>eye.</mark1><br>
