Title : Hearing <br>
Author : W. S. Merwin <br><br>

Back when it took all day to come <mark3>up</mark3><br>
from the curving broad ponds on the <mark4>plains</mark4><br>
where the green-winged jacanas ran on the lily <mark4>pads</mark4><br>
<br>
easing past tracks at the mouths of <mark4>gorges</mark4><br>
crossing villages silted in <mark4>hollows</mark4><br>
in the <mark4>foothills</mark4><br>
each with its lime-washed church by the baked <mark3>square</mark3><br>
of red earth and its <br>
talkers eating fruit under <mark4>trees</mark4><br>
<br>
turning a corner and <mark4>catching</mark4><br>
sight at last of inky forests far <mark4>above</mark4><br>
steep as <mark4>faces</mark4><br>
with the clouds stroking them and the <mark4>glimmering</mark4><br>
airy valleys opening out of <mark4>them</mark4><br>
<br>
waterfalls still roared from the <mark4>folds</mark4><br>
of the <mark4>mountain</mark4><br>
white and thundering and spray <mark4>drifted</mark4><br>
around us swirling into the broad <mark4>leaves</mark4><br>
and the waiting <mark4>boughs</mark4><br>
<br>
once I took a tin cup and <mark4>climbed</mark4><br>
the sluiced rocks and mossy branches <mark4>beside</mark4><br>
one of the high <mark4>falls</mark4><br>
looking up step by step into <br>
the green sky from which rain was <mark4>falling</mark4><br>
when I looked back from a ledge there were only   <br>
dripping leaves below <mark1>me</mark1><br>
and <mark4>flowers</mark4><br>
<br>
beside me the <mark4>hissing</mark4><br>
cataract plunged into the <mark1>trees</mark1><br>
holding on I moved <mark4>closer</mark4><br>
left foot on a rock in the <mark4>water</mark4><br>
right foot on a rock in deeper <mark1>water</mark1><br>
at the edge of the <mark5>fall</mark5><br>
then from under the weight of my right <mark5>foot</mark5><br>
came a voice like a small bell <mark4>singing</mark4><br>
over and over one clear <mark4>treble</mark4><br>
<br>
I could feel it <mark4>move</mark4><br>
I could feel it ring in my foot in my <mark4>skin</mark4><br>
in my ears in my <mark3>hair</mark3><br>
<br>
I could feel it in my tongue and in the <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
holding the <mark3>cup</mark3><br>
as long as I stood there it went <mark4>on</mark4><br>
without <mark4>changing</mark4><br>
when I moved the <mark1>cup</mark1><br>
<br>
still it went <mark1>on</mark1><br>
when I filled the <mark1>cup</mark1><br>
in the falling <mark4>column</mark4><br>
still it went <mark1>on</mark1><br>
when I drank it rang in my <mark4>eyes</mark4><br>
through the thunder <mark4>curtain</mark4><br>
when I filled the cup <mark4>again</mark4><br>
<br>
when I raised my <mark1>foot</mark1><br>
still it went <mark1>on</mark1><br>
and all the way <mark4>down</mark4><br>
from wet rock to wet <mark4>rock</mark4><br>
green branch to green branch <br>
it came with <mark1>me</mark1><br>
until I <mark4>stood</mark4><br>
<br>
looking up and we <mark4>drank</mark4><br>
the light <mark1>water</mark1><br>
and when we went on we <mark3>could</mark3><br>
still hear the <mark4>sound</mark4><br>
as far as the next turn on the way <mark4>over</mark4><br>
