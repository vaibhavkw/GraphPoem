Title : Montana Pastoral <br>
Author : J. V. Cunningham <br><br>

I am no shepherd of a child's <mark3>surmises.</mark3><br>
I have seen fear where the coiled serpent <mark3>rises,</mark3><br>
<br>
Thirst where the grasses burn in early <mark3>May</mark3><br>
And thistle, mustard, and the wild oat <mark3>stay.</mark3><br>
<br>
There is dust in this air. I saw in the <mark3>heat</mark3><br>
Grasshoppers busy in the threshing <mark3>wheat.</mark3><br>
<br>
So to this hour. Through the warm dusk I <mark3>drove</mark3><br>
To blizzards sifting on the hissing <mark3>stove,</mark3><br>
<br>
And found no images of pastoral <mark3>will,</mark3><br>
But fear, thirst, hunger, and this huddled <mark3>chill.</mark3><br>
