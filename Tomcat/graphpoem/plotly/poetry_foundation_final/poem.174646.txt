Title : from The Princess: Home they Brought her Warrior Dead <br>
Author : Alfred, Lord Tennyson <br><br>

Home they brought her warrior <mark3>dead:</mark3><br>
She nor swoon'd nor utter'd <mark3>cry:</mark3><br>
All her maidens, watching, <mark3>said,</mark3><br>
"She must weep or she will <mark3>die."</mark3><br>
<br>
Then they praised him, soft and <mark3>low,</mark3><br>
Call'd him worthy to be <mark4>loved,</mark4><br>
Truest friend and noblest <mark3>foe;</mark3><br>
Yet she neither spoke nor <mark4>moved.</mark4><br>
<br>
Stole a maiden from her <mark3>place,</mark3><br>
Lightly to the warrior <mark3>stepped,</mark3><br>
Took the face-cloth from the <mark3>face;</mark3><br>
Yet she neither moved nor <mark3>wept.</mark3><br>
<br>
Rose a nurse of ninety <mark3>years,</mark3><br>
Set his child upon her <mark3>knee--</mark3><br>
Like summer tempest came her <mark3>tears--</mark3><br>
"Sweet my child, I live for <mark3>thee."</mark3><br>
