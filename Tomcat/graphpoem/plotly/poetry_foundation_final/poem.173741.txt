Title : Lines on the Mermaid Tavern <br>
Author : John Keats <br><br>

Souls of Poets dead and <mark4>gone,</mark4><br>
What Elysium have ye <mark4>known,</mark4><br>
Happy field or mossy <mark4>cavern,</mark4><br>
Choicer than the Mermaid <mark3>Tavern?</mark3><br>
Have ye tippled drink more <mark4>fine</mark4><br>
Than mine host's Canary <mark3>wine?</mark3><br>
Or are fruits of Paradise<br>
Sweeter than those dainty pies<br>
Of venison? O generous <mark4>food!</mark4><br>
Drest as though bold Robin <mark4>Hood</mark4><br>
Would, with his maid <mark4>Marian,</mark4><br>
Sup and bowse from horn and <mark4>can.</mark4><br>
<br>
I have heard that on a <mark3>day</mark3><br>
Mine host's sign-board flew <mark3>away,</mark3><br>
Nobody knew whither, <mark3>till</mark3><br>
An astrologer's old <mark3>quill</mark3><br>
To a sheepskin gave the <mark3>story,</mark3><br>
Said he saw you in your <mark3>glory,</mark3><br>
Underneath a new old <mark4>sign</mark4><br>
Sipping beverage <mark3>divine,</mark3><br>
And pledging with contented <mark4>smack</mark4><br>
The Mermaid in the <mark4>Zodiac.</mark4><br>
<br>
Souls of Poets dead and <mark1>gone,</mark1><br>
What Elysium have ye <mark1>known,</mark1><br>
Happy field or mossy <mark1>cavern,</mark1><br>
Choicer than the Mermaid <mark1>Tavern?</mark1><br>
