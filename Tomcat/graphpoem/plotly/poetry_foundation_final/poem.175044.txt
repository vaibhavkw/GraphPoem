Rigid Body (sings).<br>
Gin a body meet a <mark1>body</mark1><br>
Flyin' through the <mark3>air,</mark3><br>
Gin a body hit a <mark1>body,</mark1><br>
Will it fly? and <mark3>where?</mark3><br>
Ilka impact has its measure,<br>
Ne'er a ane hae <mark3>I,</mark3><br>
Yet a' the lads they measure <mark3>me,</mark3><br>
Or, at least, they <mark3>try.</mark3><br>
<br>
Gin a body meet a <mark1>body</mark1><br>
Altogether <mark3>free,</mark3><br>
How they travel afterwards<br>
We do not always <mark3>see.</mark3><br>
Ilka problem has its method<br>
By analytics <mark3>high;</mark3><br>
For me, I ken na ane o' them,<br>
But what the waur am <mark1>I?</mark1><br>
