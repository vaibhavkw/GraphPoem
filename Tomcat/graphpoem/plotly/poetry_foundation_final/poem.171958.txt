Title : Autumn Shade <br>
Author : Edgar Bowers <br><br>

<br>
The autumn shade is thin. Grey leaves lie <mark4>faint</mark4><br>
Where they will lie, and, where the thick green <mark4>was,</mark4><br>
Light stands up, like a presence, to the <mark1>sky.</mark1><br>
The trees seem merely shadows of its <mark3>age.</mark3><br>
From off the hill, I hear the logging <mark3>crew,</mark3><br>
The furious and indifferent saw, the <mark3>slow</mark3><br>
Response of heavy pine; and I <mark4>recall</mark4><br>
That goddesses have died when their trees <mark4>died.</mark4><br>
Often in summer, drinking from the <mark4>spring,</mark4><br>
I sensed in its cool breath and in its <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
A living form, darker than any <mark4>shade</mark4><br>
And without feature, passionate, yet <mark4>chill</mark4><br>
With lust to fix in ice the buoyant <mark4>rim?</mark4><br>
Ancient of days, the mother of us <mark4>all.</mark4><br>
Now, toward his destined passion there, the <mark4>strong,</mark4><br>
Vivid young man, reluctant, may <mark4>return</mark4><br>
From suffering in his own <mark4>experience</mark4><br>
To lie down in the darkness. In this <mark4>time,</mark4><br>
I stay in doors. I do my work. I <mark1>sleep.</mark1><br>
Each morning, when I <mark1>wake</mark1>, I assent to <mark1>wake.</mark1><br>
The shadow of my fist moves on this <mark3>page,</mark3><br>
Though, even now, in the wood, beneath a <mark4>bank,</mark4><br>
Coiled in the leaves and cooling rocks, the <mark4>snake</mark4><br>
Does as it must, and sinks into the <mark4>cold.</mark4><br>
Nights grow colder. The Hunter and the <mark3>Bear</mark3><br>
<br>
Follow their tranquil course outside my <mark5>window.</mark5><br>
<br>
I feel the gentian waiting in the <mark4>wood,</mark4><br>
Blossoms waxy and blue, and blue-green <mark4>stems</mark4><br>
Of the amaryllis waiting in the <mark4>garden.</mark4><br>
I know, as though I waited what they <mark4>wait,</mark4><br>
The cold that fastens ice about the <mark4>root,</mark4><br>
A heavenly form, the same in all its <mark4>changes,</mark4><br>
Inimitable, <mark4>terrible</mark4>, and <mark4>still,</mark4><br>
And beautiful as frost. Fire warms my <mark4>room.</mark4><br>
Its light declares my books and pictures. <mark4>Gently,</mark4><br>
A dead soprano sings Mozart and <mark4>Bach.</mark4><br>
I drink bourbon, then go to bed, and <mark1>sleep</mark1><br>
In the Promethean heat of summer's <mark4>essence.</mark4><br>
Awakened by some fear, I watch the <mark1>sky.</mark1><br>
Compelled as though by purposes they <mark3>know,</mark3><br>
The stars, in their blue distance, still <mark4>affirm</mark4><br>
<br>
The bond of heaven and earth, the ancient <mark3>way.</mark3><br>
<br>
This old assurance haunts small creatures, <mark4>dazed</mark4><br>
In icy mud, though cold may freeze them <mark3>there</mark3><br>
And leave them as they are all summer <mark3>long.</mark3><br>
I cannot sleep. Passion and <mark4>consequence,</mark4><br>
The brutal given, and all I have <mark4>desired</mark4><br>
Evade me, and the lucid <mark4>majesty</mark4><br>
That warmed the dull barbarian to <mark4>life.</mark4><br>
So I lie here, left with <mark4>self-consciousness,</mark4><br>
Enemy whom I love but whom his <mark4>change</mark4><br>
And his forgetfulness again <mark4>compel,</mark4><br>
Impassioned, toward my lost <mark4>indifference,</mark4><br>
Faithful, but to an absence. Who shares my <mark4>bed?</mark4><br>
Who lies beside me, certain of his <mark4>waking,</mark4><br>
Led sleeping, by his own dream, to the <mark3>day?</mark3><br>
If I ask you, angel, will you come and <mark3>lead</mark3><br>
This ache to speech, or carry me, like a <mark4>child,</mark4><br>
To riot? Ever young, you come of <mark1>age</mark1><br>
Remote, a pledge of distances, this <mark4>pang</mark4><br>
I notice at dusk, watching you <mark4>subside</mark4><br>
<br>
From tree-tops and from fields. Mysterious <mark4>self,</mark4><br>
<br>
Image of the fabulous <mark4>alien,</mark4><br>
Even in sleep you summon me, even <mark1>there,</mark1><br>
When, under his native tree, Odysseus <mark4>hears</mark4><br>
His own incredible past and future, <mark4>whispered</mark4><br>
By wisdom, but by wisdom in <mark4>disguise.</mark4><br>
Thinking of a bravura deed, a <mark4>place</mark4><br>
Sacred to a divinity, an <mark4>old</mark4><br>
Verse that seems new, I postulate a <mark4>man</mark4><br>
Mastered by his own image of <mark3>himself.</mark3><br>
Who is it says, I am? Sensuous <mark4>angel,</mark4><br>
Vessel of nerve and blood, the impoverished <mark3>heir</mark3><br>
Of an awareness other than his <mark4>own?</mark4><br>
<br>
Not <mark4>these</mark4>, but one to come? For there he <mark4>is,</mark4><br>
<br>
In a steel helmet, raging, fearing his death, <br>
Carrying bread and water to a <mark4>quiet,</mark4><br>
Placing ten sounds together in one <mark4>sound:</mark4><br>
Confirming his election, or merely <mark1>still,</mark1><br>
Sleeping, or in a colloquy with the <mark4>sun.</mark4><br>
Snow and then rain. The roads are wet. A <mark4>car</mark4><br>
Slips and strains in the <mark4>mire</mark4>, and I <mark4>remember</mark4><br>
Driving in France: weapons-carriers and <mark4>jeeps;</mark4><br>
Our clothes and bodies stiffened by mud; our <mark4>minds</mark4><br>
Diverted from fear. We labor. <mark4>Overhead,</mark4><br>
A plane, Berlin or Frankfurt, now New <mark4>York.</mark4><br>
The car pulls clear. My neighbor smiles. He is <mark1>old.</mark1><br>
Was this our wisdom, simply, in a <mark4>chance,</mark4><br>
In danger, to be mastered by a <mark4>task,</mark4><br>
<br>
Like groping round a chair, through a door, to <mark1>bed?</mark1><br>
<br>
A dormant season, and, under the dripping <mark3>tree,</mark3><br>
Not sovereign, ordering nothing, letting the <mark4>past</mark4><br>
Do with me as it will, I savor <mark1>place</mark1><br>
And weather, air and sun. Though <mark4>Hercules</mark4><br>
Confronts his nature in his deed, <mark4>repeats</mark4><br>
His purposes, and is his will, <mark4>intact,</mark4><br>
Magnificent, and memorable, I <mark3>try</mark3><br>
The simplest forms of our old <mark4>poverty.</mark4><br>
I seek no end appointed in my <mark4>absence</mark4><br>
Beyond the silence I already <mark4>share.</mark4><br>
I drive home with the books that I will <mark3>read.</mark3><br>
<br>
The streets are harsh with traffic. Where I <mark4>once</mark4><br>
<br>
Played as a boy amid old stands of <mark4>pine,</mark4><br>
Row after row of houses. Lined by the <mark3>new</mark3><br>
Debris of wealth and power, the broken <mark4>road.</mark4><br>
Then miles of red clay bank and frugal <mark4>ground.</mark4><br>
At last, in the minor hills, my father's <mark1>place,</mark1><br>
Where I can find my way as in a <mark4>thought?</mark4><br>
Gardens, the trees we planted, all we <mark1>share.</mark1><br>
A Cherokee trail runs north to summer <mark4>hunting.</mark4><br>
I see it, when I look up from the <mark1>page.</mark1><br>
In nameless warmth, sun light in every <mark4>corner,</mark4><br>
Bending my body over my glowing <mark4>book,</mark4><br>
<br>
I share the room. Is it with a voice or touch <br>
<br>
Or look, as of an absence, learned by <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
Now, merely mine? Annunciation, <mark4>specter</mark4><br>
Of the worn out, lost, or broken, telling what <mark4>future.</mark4><br>
What vivid loss to <mark4>come</mark4>, you change the <mark1>room</mark1><br>
And him who reads here. Restless, he will <mark5>stir,</mark5><br>
Look round, and see the room renewed and <mark3>line,</mark3><br>
Color, and shape as, in <mark3>desire</mark3>, they <mark3>are,</mark3><br>
Not shadows but substantial <mark4>light</mark4>, <mark4>explicit,</mark4><br>
Bright as glass, inexhaustible, and <mark3>true.</mark3><br>
My shadow moves, until, at noon, I <mark4>stand</mark4><br>
Within its seal, as in the finished <mark1>past.</mark1><br>
But in the place where effect and cause are <mark4>joined,</mark4><br>
<br>
In the warmth or cold of my <mark4>remembering,</mark4><br>
<br>
Of love, of partial freedom, the time to <mark4>be</mark4><br>
Trembles and glitters again in windy <mark4>light.</mark4><br>
For nothing is <mark4>disposed</mark4>, The slow soft <mark4>wind</mark4><br>
Tilting the blood-root keeps its gentle <mark4>edge.</mark4><br>
The intimate cry, both sinister and <mark3>tender,</mark3><br>
Once heard, is heard confined in its <mark4>reserve.</mark4><br>
My image of myself, apart, <mark4>informed</mark4><br>
By many deaths, resists me, and I <mark3>stay</mark3><br>
Almost as I have been, intact, <mark4>aware,</mark4><br>
Alive, though proud and cautious, even <mark4>afraid.</mark4><br>
