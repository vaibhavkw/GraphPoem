Title : Clouds <br>
Author : Denise Levertov <br><br>

The clouds as I see them, <mark4>rising</mark4><br>
<mark4>urgently</mark4>, roseate in <mark4>the</mark4><br>
mounting of somber <mark4>power</mark4><br>
<br>
surging in evening haste <mark4>over</mark4><br>
roofs and hermetic   <br>
grim <mark4>walls--</mark4><br>
<br>
Last <mark3>night</mark3><br>
as if death had lit a pale <mark3>light</mark3><br>
in your <mark1>flesh</mark1>, your <mark1>flesh</mark1><br>
was cold to my touch, or not <mark4>cold</mark4><br>
but cool, cooling, as if the last <mark4>traces</mark4><br>
of warmth were still fading in you. <br>
My thigh burned in cold fear where   <br>
yours touched <mark4>it.</mark4><br>
<br>
But I forced to mind my vision of a sky   <br>
close and enclosed, unlike the space in which these clouds move-- <br>
a sky of gray mist it <mark4>appeared--</mark4><br>
and how looking intently at it we saw <br>
its gray was not gray but a milky <mark4>white</mark4><br>
in which radiant traces of opal <mark4>greens,</mark4><br>
fiery blues, gleamed, faded, gleamed <mark4>again,</mark4><br>
and how only then, seeing the color in the <mark5>gray,</mark5><br>
a field sprang into sight, <mark4>extending</mark4><br>
between where we stood and the <mark4>horizon,</mark4><br>
<br>
a field of freshest deep spiring <mark5>grass</mark5><br>
starred with <mark4>dandelions,</mark4><br>
green and <mark4>gold</mark4><br>
gold and green alternating in closewoven   <br>
chords, madrigal <mark4>field.</mark4><br>
<br>
Is death's chill that visited our <mark4>bed</mark4><br>
other than what it seemed, is <mark1>it</mark1><br>
a gray to be watched <mark4>keenly?</mark4><br>
<br>
Wiping my glasses and leaning <mark4>westward,</mark4><br>
clearing my mind of the day's mist and <mark4>leaning</mark4><br>
into myself to see <br>
the colors of truth <br>
<br>
I watch the clouds as I see <mark5>them</mark5><br>
in pomp <mark4>advancing</mark4>, <mark4>pursuing</mark4><br>
the fallen <mark4>sun.</mark4><br>
