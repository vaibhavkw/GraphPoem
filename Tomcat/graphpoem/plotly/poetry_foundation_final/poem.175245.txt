Title : I Love all Beauteous Things <br>
Author : Robert Bridges <br><br>

I love all beauteous <mark4>things,</mark4><br>
I seek and adore <mark1>them;</mark1><br>
God hath no better <mark4>praise,</mark4><br>
And man in his hasty <mark3>days</mark3><br>
Is honoured for <mark1>them.</mark1><br>
<br>
I too will something <mark5>make</mark5><br>
And joy in the <mark5>making;</mark5><br>
Altho' to-morrow it <mark4>seem</mark4><br>
Like the empty words of a <mark3>dream</mark3><br>
Remembered on <mark3>waking.</mark3><br>
