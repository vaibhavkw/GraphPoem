Title : To Sleep <br>
Author : John Keats <br><br>

<br>
O soft embalmer of the still <mark4>midnight,</mark4><br>
Shutting, with careful fingers and <mark3>benign,</mark3><br>
Our gloom-pleas'd eyes, embower'd from the <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
Enshaded in forgetfulness <mark3>divine:</mark3><br>
O soothest Sleep! if so it please thee, <mark4>close</mark4><br>
In midst of this thine hymn my willing <mark4>eyes,</mark4><br>
Or wait the "Amen," ere thy poppy <mark4>throws</mark4><br>
Around my bed its lulling <mark4>charities.</mark4><br>
Then save me, or the passed day will <mark3>shine</mark3><br>
Upon my pillow, breeding many <mark4>woes,?</mark4><br>
Save me from curious Conscience, that still <mark4>lords</mark4><br>
Its strength for darkness, burrowing like a <mark3>mole;</mark3><br>
Turn the key deftly in the oiled <mark3>wards,</mark3><br>
And seal the hushed Casket of my <mark3>Soul.</mark3><br>
