Title : Nephelidia <br>
Author : Algernon Charles Swinburne <br><br>

From the depth of the dreamy decline of the dawn through a notable nimbus of nebulous noonshine, <br>
Pallid and pink as the palm of the flag-flower that flickers with fear of the flies as they <mark3>float,</mark3><br>
Are they looks of our lovers that lustrously lean from a marvel of mystic miraculous <mark4>moonshine,</mark4><br>
These that we feel in the blood of our blushes that thicken and threaten with throbs through the <mark3>throat?</mark3><br>
Thicken and thrill as a theatre thronged at appeal of an actor's appalled <mark4>agitation,</mark4><br>
Fainter with fear of the fires of the future than pale with the promise of pride in the <mark4>past;</mark4><br>
Flushed with the famishing fullness of fever that reddens with radiance of rathe <mark3>recreation,</mark3><br>
Gaunt as the ghastliest of glimpses that gleam through the gloom of the gloaming when ghosts go <mark3>aghast?</mark3><br>
Nay, for the nick of the tick of the time is a tremulous touch on the temples of <mark3>terror,</mark3><br>
Strained as the sinews yet strenuous with strife of the dead who is dumb as the dust-heaps of <mark3>death:</mark3><br>
Surely no soul is it, sweet as the spasm of erotic emotional exquisite <mark3>error,</mark3><br>
Bathed in the balms of beatified bliss, beatific itself by beatitude's <mark3>breath.</mark3><br>
Surely no spirit or sense of a soul that was soft to the spirit and soul of our <mark4>senses</mark4><br>
Sweetens the stress of suspiring suspicion that sobs in the semblance and sound of a <mark3>sigh;</mark3><br>
Only this oracle opens Olympian, in mystical moods and triangular tenses-- <br>
"Life is the lust of a lamp for the light that is dark till the dawn of the day when we <mark3>die."</mark3><br>
Mild is the mirk and monotonous music of <mark4>memory</mark4>, melodiously mute as it may <mark4>be,</mark4><br>
While the hope in the heart of a hero is bruised by the breach of men's rapiers, resigned to the <mark3>rod;</mark3><br>
Made meek as a mother whose bosom-beats bound with the bliss-bringing bulk of a balm-breathing <mark3>baby,</mark3><br>
As they grope through the grave-yard of creeds, under skies growing green at a groan for the grimness of <mark3>God.</mark3><br>
Blank is the book of his bounty beholden of old, and its binding is blacker than <mark4>bluer:</mark4><br>
Out of blue into black is the scheme of the <mark4>skies</mark4>, and their dews are the wine of the bloodshed of <mark4>things;</mark4><br>
Till the darkling desire of delight shall be free as a fawn that is freed from the fangs that pursue her, <br>
Till the heart-beats of hell shall be hushed by a hymn from the hunt that has harried the kennel of <mark3>kings.</mark3><br>
