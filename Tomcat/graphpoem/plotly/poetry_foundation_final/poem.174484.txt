Title : Prothalamion <br>
Author : Edmund Spenser <br><br>

CALM was the day, and through the trembling <mark3>air</mark3><br>
Sweet breathing Zephyrus did softly <mark3>play,</mark3><br>
A gentle spirit, that lightly did <mark3>delay</mark3><br>
Hot Titan's beams, which then did glister <mark3>fair;</mark3><br>
When I whose sullen <mark3>care,</mark3><br>
Through discontent of my long fruitless <mark3>stay</mark3><br>
In prince's court, and expectation <mark3>vain</mark3><br>
Of idle hopes, which still do fly <mark3>away</mark3><br>
Like empty shadows, did afflict my <mark3>brain,</mark3><br>
Walked forth to ease my <mark3>pain</mark3><br>
Along the shore of silver streaming <mark3>Thames,</mark3><br>
Whose rutty bank, the which his river <mark3>hems,</mark3><br>
Was painted all with variable <mark4>flowers,</mark4><br>
And all the meads adorned with dainty <mark4>gems,</mark4><br>
Fit to deck maidens' <mark4>bowers,</mark4><br>
And crown their paramours, <br>
Against the bridal day, which is not <mark3>long:</mark3><br>
Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my <mark3>song.</mark3><br>
<br>
There, in a meadow, by the river's <mark3>side,</mark3><br>
A flock of nymphs I chanced to <mark4>espy,</mark4><br>
All lovely daughters of the flood <mark3>thereby,</mark3><br>
With goodly greenish locks, all loose <mark3>untied,</mark3><br>
As each had been a <mark3>bride;</mark3><br>
And each one had a little wicker <mark4>basket,</mark4><br>
Made of fine twigs, entrailed <mark4>curiously,</mark4><br>
In which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket, <br>
And with fine fingers cropt full <mark5>featously</mark5><br>
The tender stalks on <mark3>high.</mark3><br>
Of every sort, which in that meadow <mark3>grew,</mark3><br>
They gathered some; the violet pallid <mark3>blue,</mark3><br>
The little daisy, that at evening <mark4>closes,</mark4><br>
The virgin lily, and the primrose <mark3>true,</mark3><br>
With store of vermeil <mark3>roses,</mark3><br>
To deck their bridegrooms' posies <br>
Against the bridal day, which was not <mark1>long:</mark1><br>
Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my <mark1>song.</mark1><br>
<br>
With that, I saw two swans of goodly <mark3>hue</mark3><br>
Come softly swimming down along the <mark3>Lee;</mark3><br>
Two fairer birds I yet did never <mark3>see.</mark3><br>
The snow which doth the top of Pindus <mark3>strew,</mark3><br>
Did never whiter <mark3>shew,</mark3><br>
Nor Jove himself, when he a swan would <mark3>be</mark3><br>
For love of Leda, whiter did <mark4>appear:</mark4><br>
Yet Leda was they say as white as <mark3>he,</mark3><br>
Yet not so white as these, nor nothing <mark3>near.</mark3><br>
So purely white they were, <br>
That even the gentle stream, the which them <mark4>bare,</mark4><br>
Seemed foul to them, and bade his billows <mark3>spare</mark3><br>
To wet their silken feathers, lest they <mark4>might</mark4><br>
Soil their fair plumes with water not so <mark1>fair,</mark1><br>
And mar their beauties <mark3>bright,</mark3><br>
That shone as heaven's <mark3>light,</mark3><br>
Against their bridal day, which was not <mark1>long:</mark1><br>
Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my <mark1>song.</mark1><br>
<br>
Eftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their <mark3>fill,</mark3><br>
Ran all in haste, to see that silver <mark4>brood,</mark4><br>
As they came floating on the crystal <mark4>flood.</mark4><br>
Whom when they saw, they stood amazed <mark3>still,</mark3><br>
Their wondering eyes to <mark1>fill.</mark1><br>
Them seemed they never saw a sight so <mark1>fair,</mark1><br>
Of fowls so lovely, that they sure did <mark3>deem</mark3><br>
Them heavenly born, or to be that same <mark3>pair</mark3><br>
Which through the sky draw Venus' silver <mark3>team;</mark3><br>
For sure they did not <mark3>seem</mark3><br>
To be begot of any earthly <mark4>seed,</mark4><br>
But rather angels, or of angels' <mark3>breed:</mark3><br>
Yet were they bred of Somers-heat they <mark3>say,</mark3><br>
In sweetest season, when each flower and <mark3>weed</mark3><br>
The earth did fresh <mark3>array,</mark3><br>
So fresh they seemed as <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
Even as their bridal day, which was not <mark1>long:</mark1><br>
Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my <mark1>song.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then forth they all out of their baskets <mark3>drew</mark3><br>
Great store of flowers, the honour of the <mark4>field,</mark4><br>
That to the sense did fragrant odours <mark3>yield,</mark3><br>
All which upon those goodly birds they <mark3>threw,</mark3><br>
And all the waves did <mark1>strew,</mark1><br>
That like old Peneus' waters they did <mark1>seem,</mark1><br>
When down along by pleasant Tempe's <mark4>shore,</mark4><br>
Scattered with flowers, through Thessaly they <mark3>stream,</mark3><br>
That they appear through lilies' plenteous <mark3>store,</mark3><br>
Like a bride's chamber <mark3>floor.</mark3><br>
Two of those nymphs meanwhile, two garlands <mark4>bound,</mark4><br>
Of freshest flowers which in that mead they <mark3>found,</mark3><br>
The which presenting all in trim <mark1>array,</mark1><br>
Their snowy foreheads therewithal they <mark3>crowned,</mark3><br>
Whilst one did sing this <mark3>lay,</mark3><br>
Prepared against that <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
Against their bridal day, which was not <mark1>long:</mark1><br>
Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my <mark1>song.</mark1><br>
<br>
'Ye gentle birds, the world's fair <mark4>ornament,</mark4><br>
And heaven's glory, whom this happy <mark4>hour</mark4><br>
Doth lead unto your lovers' blissful <mark3>bower,</mark3><br>
Joy may you have and gentle heart's <mark4>content</mark4><br>
Of your love's <mark4>complement:</mark4><br>
And let fair Venus, that is queen of <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
With her heart-quelling son upon you <mark4>smile,</mark4><br>
Whose smile, they say, hath virtue to <mark4>remove</mark4><br>
All love's dislike, and friendship's faulty <mark3>guile</mark3><br>
For ever to assoil. <br>
Let endless peace your steadfast hearts <mark4>accord,</mark4><br>
And blessed plenty wait upon your <mark3>board,</mark3><br>
And let your bed with pleasures chaste <mark4>abound,</mark4><br>
That fruitful issue may to you <mark4>afford,</mark4><br>
Which may your foes <mark4>confound,</mark4><br>
And make your joys <mark3>redound</mark3><br>
Upon your bridal day, which is not <mark1>long:</mark1><br>
Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my <mark1>song.'</mark1><br>
<br>
So ended she; and all the rest <mark3>around</mark3><br>
To her redoubled that her undersong, <br>
Which said their bridal day should not be <mark1>long.</mark1><br>
And gentle echo from the neighbour <mark3>ground</mark3><br>
Their accents did <mark3>resound.</mark3><br>
So forth those joyous birds did pass <mark3>along,</mark3><br>
Adown the Lee, that to them murmured <mark3>low,</mark3><br>
As he would speak, but that he lacked a <mark4>tongue,</mark4><br>
Yet did by signs his glad affection <mark3>show,</mark3><br>
Making his stream run <mark3>slow.</mark3><br>
And all the fowl which in his flood did <mark4>dwell</mark4><br>
Gan flock about these twain, that did <mark3>excel</mark3><br>
The rest so far as Cynthia doth <mark5>shend</mark5><br>
The lesser stars. So they, enranged <mark3>well,</mark3><br>
Did on those two <mark4>attend,</mark4><br>
And their best service <mark3>lend,</mark3><br>
Against their wedding day, which was not <mark1>long:</mark1><br>
Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my <mark1>song.</mark1><br>
<br>
At length they all to merry London <mark4>came,</mark4><br>
To merry London, my most kindly <mark4>nurse,</mark4><br>
That to me gave this life's first native <mark4>source;</mark4><br>
Though from another place I take my <mark3>name,</mark3><br>
An house of ancient <mark3>fame.</mark3><br>
There when they came, whereas those bricky <mark4>towers,</mark4><br>
The which on Thames' broad aged back do <mark4>ride,</mark4><br>
Where now the studious lawyers have their <mark1>bowers</mark1><br>
There whilom wont the Templar Knights to <mark3>bide,</mark3><br>
Till they decayed through <mark3>pride:</mark3><br>
Next whereunto there stands a stately <mark4>place,</mark4><br>
Where oft I gained gifts and goodly <mark3>grace</mark3><br>
Of that great lord, which therein wont to <mark1>dwell,</mark1><br>
Whose want too well now feels my friendless <mark3>case.</mark3><br>
But ah, here fits not <mark1>well</mark1><br>
Old woes but joys to <mark3>tell</mark3><br>
Against the bridal day, which is not <mark1>long:</mark1><br>
Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my <mark1>song.</mark1><br>
<br>
Yet therein now doth lodge a noble <mark4>peer,</mark4><br>
Great England's glory, and the world's wide <mark4>wonder,</mark4><br>
Whose dreadful name late through all Spain did <mark3>thunder,</mark3><br>
And Hercules' two pillars standing <mark1>near</mark1><br>
Did make to quake and <mark3>fear:</mark3><br>
Fair branch of honour, flower of <mark4>chivalry,</mark4><br>
That fillest England with thy triumph's <mark1>fame,</mark1><br>
Joy have thou of thy noble <mark4>victory,</mark4><br>
And endless happiness of thine own <mark1>name</mark1><br>
That promiseth the <mark3>same:</mark3><br>
That through thy prowess and victorious <mark4>arms,</mark4><br>
Thy country may be freed from foreign <mark3>harms;</mark3><br>
And great Elisa's glorious name may <mark4>ring</mark4><br>
Through all the world, filled with thy wide <mark3>alarms,</mark3><br>
Which some brave Muse may <mark3>sing</mark3><br>
To ages <mark4>following,</mark4><br>
Upon the bridal day, which is not <mark1>long:</mark1><br>
Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my <mark1>song.</mark1><br>
<br>
From those high towers this noble lord <mark4>issuing,</mark4><br>
Like radiant Hesper when his golden <mark4>hair</mark4><br>
In th'Ocean billows he hath bathed <mark1>fair,</mark1><br>
Descended to the river's open <mark4>viewing,</mark4><br>
With a great train <mark4>ensuing.</mark4><br>
Above the rest were goodly to be <mark4>seen</mark4><br>
Two gentle knights of lovely face and <mark4>feature</mark4><br>
Beseeming well the bower of any <mark3>queen,</mark3><br>
With gifts of wit and ornaments of <mark4>nature,</mark4><br>
Fit for so goodly <mark4>stature;</mark4><br>
That like the twins of Jove they seemed in <mark4>sight,</mark4><br>
Which deck the baldric of the heavens <mark1>bright.</mark1><br>
They two forth pacing to the river's <mark1>side,</mark1><br>
Received those two fair birds, their love's <mark3>delight;</mark3><br>
Which, at th' appointed <mark3>tide,</mark3><br>
Each one did make his <mark1>bride</mark1><br>
Against their bridal day, which is not <mark1>long:</mark1><br>
Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my <mark1>song.</mark1><br>
