as regarded from a great distance<br>
Impersonal the <mark3>aim</mark3><br>
Where giant movements <mark3>tend;</mark3><br>
Each man appears the <mark3>same;</mark3><br>
Friend vanishes from <mark3>friend.</mark3><br>
<br>
In the long path of <mark4>lead</mark4><br>
That changes place like <mark3>light</mark3><br>
No shape of hand or <mark3>head</mark3><br>
Means anything <mark3>tonight.</mark3><br>
<br>
Only the common <mark3>will</mark3><br>
For which explosion <mark3>spoke;</mark3><br>
And stiff on field and <mark3>hill</mark3><br>
The dark blood of the <mark3>folk.</mark3><br>
