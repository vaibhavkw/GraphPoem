Title : Ultima Thule: Dedication to G. W. G. <br>
Author : Henry Wadsworth Longfellow <br><br>

With favoring <mark4>winds</mark4>, o'er sunlit <mark4>seas,</mark4><br>
We sailed for the Hesperides, <br>
The land where golden apples <mark3>grow;</mark3><br>
But that, ah! that was long <mark3>ago.</mark3><br>
<br>
How far, since then, the ocean <mark4>streams</mark4><br>
Have swept us from that land of <mark3>dreams,</mark3><br>
That land of fiction and of <mark3>truth,</mark3><br>
The lost Atlantis of our <mark3>youth!</mark3><br>
<br>
Whither, ah, whither? Are not <mark4>these</mark4><br>
The tempest-haunted Orcades, <br>
Where sea-gulls scream, and breakers <mark3>roar,</mark3><br>
And wreck and sea-weed line the <mark3>shore?</mark3><br>
<br>
Ultima Thule! Utmost <mark3>Isle!</mark3><br>
Here in thy harbors for a <mark3>while</mark3><br>
We lower our sails; a while we <mark3>rest</mark3><br>
From the unending, endless <mark3>quest.</mark3><br>
