Title : Delia 6: Fair is my love, and cruel as she's fair <br>
Author : Samuel Daniel <br><br>

<br>
Fair is my love, and cruel as she's <mark3>fair:</mark3><br>
Her brow shades frowns although her eyes are <mark3>sunny,</mark3><br>
Her smiles are lightning though her pride <mark3>despair,</mark3><br>
And her disdains are gall, her favours <mark3>honey;</mark3><br>
A modest maid, deck'd with a blush of <mark5>honour,</mark5><br>
Whose feet do tread green paths of youth and <mark3>love,</mark3><br>
The wonder of all eyes that look upon her:<br>
Sacred on earth, design'd a saint <mark3>above.</mark3><br>
Chastity and beauty, which were deadly <mark3>foes,</mark3><br>
Live reconciled friends within her <mark3>brow;</mark3><br>
And had she pity to conjoin with <mark3>those,</mark3><br>
Then who had heard the plaints I utter <mark3>now?</mark3><br>
For had she not been fair and thus <mark3>unkind,</mark3><br>
My muse had slept, and none had known my <mark3>mind.</mark3><br>
