Title : The Golden Age <br>

is thought to be a confession, won by <mark4>endless</mark4><br>
torture, but which our interrogators <mark4>must</mark4><br>
hate to record--all those old code names, <mark4>dates,</mark4><br>
the standard narrative of sandpaper <br>
throats, even its remorse, fall ignored. Far <br>
<br>
away, a late (not lost) messenger <mark4>stares,</mark4><br>
struck by window bargains or is it the <mark4>gift</mark4><br>
of a sudden solicitude: is she going to <br>
lift up her shadow's weight, shift <mark4>hers</mark4><br>
onto it? She knows who bears whom. <mark4>In</mark4><br>
<br>
that momentary museum where memory <mark3>occurs</mark3><br>
more accrue of those torturers' pincers <mark4>than</mark4><br>
lessened fingernails, eyes teased to a <mark3>pulp,</mark3><br>
we beg for closeups. Ormolus, objets <mark4>d'art!</mark4><br>
A satyr drains an hourglass with one <mark3>gulp.</mark3><br>
