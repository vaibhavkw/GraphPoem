Title : But Men Loved Darkness rather than Light <br>
Author : Richard Crashaw <br><br>

The world's light shines, shine as it <mark3>will,</mark3><br>
The world will love its darkness <mark3>still.</mark3><br>
I doubt though when the world's in <mark4>hell,</mark4><br>
It will not love its darkness half so <mark3>well.</mark3><br>
