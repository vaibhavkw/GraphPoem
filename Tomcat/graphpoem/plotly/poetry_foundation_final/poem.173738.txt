Author : John Keats <br><br>

<br>
BOOK <mark1>I</mark1><br>
Deep in the shady sadness of a <mark4>vale</mark4><br>
Far sunken from the healthy breath of <mark4>morn,</mark4><br>
Far from the fiery noon, and eve's one <mark4>star,</mark4><br>
Sat gray-hair'd <mark4>Saturn</mark4>, quiet as a <mark4>stone,</mark4><br>
Still as the silence round about his <mark4>lair;</mark4><br>
Forest on forest hung about his <mark4>head</mark4><br>
Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was <mark3>there,</mark3><br>
Not so much life as on a summer's <mark5>day</mark5><br>
Robs not one light seed from the feather'd <mark4>grass,</mark4><br>
But where the dead leaf fell, there did it <mark4>rest.</mark4><br>
A stream went voiceless by, still deadened <mark4>more</mark4><br>
By reason of his fallen <mark4>divinity</mark4><br>
Spreading a shade: the Naiad 'mid her <mark4>reeds</mark4><br>
Press'd her cold finger closer to her <mark4>lips.</mark4><br>
<br>
Along the margin-sand large foot-marks <mark4>went,</mark4><br>
No further than to where his feet had <mark4>stray'd,</mark4><br>
And slept there since. Upon the sodden <mark4>ground</mark4><br>
His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, <mark4>dead,</mark4><br>
Unsceptred; and his realmless eyes were <mark4>closed;</mark4><br>
While his bow'd head seem'd list'ning to the <mark1>Earth,</mark1><br>
His ancient mother, for some comfort <mark4>yet.</mark4><br>
<br>
It seem'd no force could wake him from his <mark4>place;</mark4><br>
But there came one, who with a kindred <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
Touch'd his wide shoulders, after bending <mark3>low</mark3><br>
With reverence, though to one who knew it <mark4>not.</mark4><br>
She was a Goddess of the infant <mark4>world;</mark4><br>
By her in stature the tall <mark4>Amazon</mark4><br>
Had stood a pigmy's height; she would have <mark4>ta'en</mark4><br>
Achilles by the hair and bent his <mark1>neck;</mark1><br>
Or with a finger stay'd Ixion's <mark4>wheel.</mark4><br>
Her face was large as that of Memphian <mark4>sphinx,</mark4><br>
Pedestal'd haply in a palace <mark4>court,</mark4><br>
When sages look'd to Egypt for their <mark3>lore.</mark3><br>
But oh! how unlike marble was that <mark4>face:</mark4><br>
How beautiful, if sorrow had not <mark4>made</mark4><br>
Sorrow more beautiful than Beauty's <mark4>self.</mark4><br>
There was a listening fear in her <mark4>regard,</mark4><br>
As if calamity had but <mark4>begun;</mark4><br>
As if the vanward clouds of evil <mark4>days</mark4><br>
Had spent their malice, and the sullen <mark4>rear</mark4><br>
Was with its stored thunder labouring <mark4>up.</mark4><br>
One hand she press'd upon that aching <mark4>spot</mark4><br>
Where beats the human heart, as if just <mark1>there,</mark1><br>
Though an immortal, she felt cruel <mark4>pain:</mark4><br>
The other upon Saturn's bended <mark1>neck</mark1><br>
She laid, and to the level of his <mark4>ear</mark4><br>
Leaning with parted lips, some words she <mark4>spake</mark4><br>
In solemn tenour and deep organ <mark4>tone:</mark4><br>
Some mourning words, which in our feeble <mark5>tongue</mark5><br>
Would come in these like accents; O how <mark4>frail</mark4><br>
To that large utterance of the early <mark4>Gods!</mark4><br>
"Saturn, look up!--though wherefore, poor old <mark4>King?</mark4><br>
I have no comfort for thee, no not <mark4>one:</mark4><br>
I cannot say, "O wherefore sleepest <mark3>thou?"</mark3><br>
For heaven is parted from thee, and the <mark1>earth</mark1><br>
Knows thee not, thus <mark4>afflicted</mark4>, for a <mark4>God;</mark4><br>
And ocean too, with all its solemn <mark4>noise,</mark4><br>
Has from thy sceptre pass'd; and all the <mark4>air</mark4><br>
Is emptied of thine hoary <mark4>majesty.</mark4><br>
Thy thunder, conscious of the new <mark4>command,</mark4><br>
Rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen <mark4>house;</mark4><br>
And thy sharp lightning in unpractis'd <mark4>hands</mark4><br>
Scorches and burns our once serene <mark4>domain.</mark4><br>
O aching time! O moments big as <mark4>years!</mark4><br>
All as ye pass swell out the monstrous <mark4>truth,</mark4><br>
And press it so upon our weary griefs <br>
That unbelief has not a space to <mark5>breathe.</mark5><br>
Saturn, sleep on:--O thoughtless, why did <mark1>I</mark1><br>
Thus violate thy slumbrous <mark4>solitude?</mark4><br>
Why should I ope thy melancholy <mark4>eyes?</mark4><br>
Saturn, sleep on! while at thy feet I <mark4>weep."</mark4><br>
<br>
As when, upon a tranced <mark4>summer-night,</mark4><br>
Those green-rob'd senators of mighty <mark4>woods,</mark4><br>
Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest <mark4>stars,</mark4><br>
Dream, and so dream all night without a <mark1>stir,</mark1><br>
Save from one gradual solitary <mark4>gust</mark4><br>
Which comes upon the silence, and dies <mark4>off,</mark4><br>
As if the ebbing air had but one <mark4>wave;</mark4><br>
So came these words and went; the while in <mark4>tears</mark4><br>
She touch'd her fair large forehead to the <mark1>ground,</mark1><br>
Just where her falling hair might be outspread <br>
A soft and silken mat for Saturn's <mark4>feet.</mark4><br>
One moon, with alteration slow, had <mark4>shed</mark4><br>
Her silver seasons four upon the <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
And still these two were postured <mark4>motionless,</mark4><br>
Like natural sculpture in cathedral <mark4>cavern;</mark4><br>
The frozen God still couchant on the <mark1>earth,</mark1><br>
And the sad Goddess weeping at his <mark1>feet:</mark1><br>
Until at length old Saturn lifted <mark1>up</mark1><br>
His faded eyes, and saw his kingdom <mark4>gone,</mark4><br>
And all the gloom and sorrow of the <mark1>place,</mark1><br>
And that fair kneeling Goddess; and then <mark1>spake,</mark1><br>
As with a palsied tongue, and while his <mark4>beard</mark4><br>
Shook horrid with such <mark4>aspen-malady:</mark4><br>
"O tender spouse of gold <mark4>Hyperion,</mark4><br>
Thea, I feel thee ere I see thy <mark1>face;</mark1><br>
Look up, and let me see our doom in <mark4>it;</mark4><br>
Look <mark4>up</mark4>, and tell me if this feeble <mark4>shape</mark4><br>
Is Saturn's; tell me, if thou hear'st the <mark4>voice</mark4><br>
Of Saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling <mark3>brow,</mark3><br>
Naked and bare of its great <mark4>diadem,</mark4><br>
Peers like the front of Saturn. Who had <mark4>power</mark4><br>
To make me desolate? whence came the <mark4>strength?</mark4><br>
How was it nurtur'd to such bursting <mark4>forth,</mark4><br>
While Fate seem'd strangled in my nervous <mark4>grasp?</mark4><br>
But it is so, and I am smother'd <mark1>up,</mark1><br>
And buried from all godlike <mark4>exercise</mark4><br>
Of influence benign on planets <mark3>pale,</mark3><br>
Of admonitions to the winds and <mark4>seas,</mark4><br>
Of peaceful sway above man's <mark4>harvesting,</mark4><br>
And all those acts which Deity <mark4>supreme</mark4><br>
Doth ease its heart of love in.--I am <mark1>gone</mark1><br>
Away from my own bosom: I have <mark4>left</mark4><br>
My strong identity, my real <mark1>self,</mark1><br>
Somewhere between the throne, and where I <mark4>sit</mark4><br>
Here on this spot of earth. Search, Thea, <mark5>search!</mark5><br>
Open thine eyes eterne, and sphere them <mark4>round</mark4><br>
Upon all space: space starr'd, and lorn of <mark4>light;</mark4><br>
Space region'd with life-air; and barren <mark4>void;</mark4><br>
Spaces of fire, and all the yawn of <mark4>hell.--</mark4><br>
Search, Thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest <br>
A certain shape or shadow, making <mark3>way</mark3><br>
With wings or chariot fierce to <mark4>repossess</mark4><br>
A heaven he lost erewhile: it must--it <mark4>must</mark4><br>
Be of ripe progress--Saturn must be <mark1>King.</mark1><br>
Yes, there must be a golden <mark4>victory;</mark4><br>
There must be Gods thrown <mark4>down</mark4>, and trumpets <mark4>blown</mark4><br>
Of triumph calm, and hymns of <mark4>festival</mark4><br>
Upon the gold clouds <mark4>metropolitan,</mark4><br>
Voices of soft proclaim, and silver <mark1>stir</mark1><br>
Of strings in hollow shells; and there shall <mark4>be</mark4><br>
Beautiful things made new, for the <mark4>surprise</mark4><br>
Of the sky-children; I will give <mark1>command:</mark1><br>
Thea! Thea! Thea! where is <mark4>Saturn?"</mark4><br>
<br>
This passion lifted him upon his <mark1>feet,</mark1><br>
And made his hands to struggle in the <mark1>air,</mark1><br>
His Druid locks to shake and ooze with <mark4>sweat,</mark4><br>
His eyes to fever out, his voice to <mark4>cease.</mark4><br>
He stood, and heard not Thea's sobbing <mark4>deep;</mark4><br>
A little time, and then again he <mark4>snatch'd</mark4><br>
Utterance thus.--"But cannot I <mark4>create?</mark4><br>
Cannot I form? Cannot I fashion <mark1>forth</mark1><br>
Another world, another <mark4>universe,</mark4><br>
To overbear and crumble this to nought? <br>
Where is another chaos? Where?"--That <mark4>word</mark4><br>
Found way unto Olympus, and made <mark3>quake</mark3><br>
The rebel three.--Thea was startled <mark1>up,</mark1><br>
And in her bearing was a sort of <mark4>hope,</mark4><br>
As thus she quick-voic'd spake, yet full of awe. <br>
"This cheers our fallen house: come to our <mark4>friends,</mark4><br>
O Saturn! come away, and give them <mark4>heart;</mark4><br>
I know the covert, from thence came I <mark4>hither."</mark4><br>
Thus brief; then with beseeching eyes she <mark1>went</mark1><br>
With backward footing through the shade a <mark4>space:</mark4><br>
He follow'd, and she turn'd to lead the <mark1>way</mark1><br>
Through aged boughs, that yielded like the <mark4>mist</mark4><br>
Which eagles cleave upmounting from their <mark4>nest.</mark4><br>
<br>
Meanwhile in other realms big tears were <mark1>shed,</mark1><br>
More sorrow like to this, and such like <mark3>woe,</mark3><br>
Too huge for mortal tongue or pen of <mark5>scribe:</mark5><br>
The Titans fierce, <mark4>self-hid</mark4>, or <mark4>prison-bound,</mark4><br>
Groan'd for the old allegiance once <mark1>more,</mark1><br>
And listen'd in sharp pain for Saturn's <mark1>voice.</mark1><br>
But one of the whole mammoth-brood still <mark4>kept</mark4><br>
His sov'reignty, and rule, and <mark1>majesty;--</mark1><br>
Blazing Hyperion on his orbed <mark4>fire</mark4><br>
Still sat, still snuff'd the incense, teeming <mark1>up</mark1><br>
From man to the sun's God; yet unsecure: <br>
For as among us mortals omens drear <br>
Fright and perplex, so also shuddered <mark3>he--</mark3><br>
Not at dog's howl, or gloom-bird's hated <mark4>screech,</mark4><br>
Or the familiar visiting of <mark1>one</mark1><br>
Upon the first toll of his passing <mark4>bell,</mark4><br>
Or prophesyings of the midnight <mark4>lamp;</mark4><br>
But horrors, portion'd to a giant <mark4>nerve,</mark4><br>
Oft made Hyperion ache. His palace <mark4>bright</mark4><br>
Bastion'd with pyramids of glowing <mark4>gold,</mark4><br>
And touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks, <br>
Glar'd a blood-red through all its thousand <mark4>courts,</mark4><br>
Arches, and <mark4>domes</mark4>, and fiery <mark4>galleries;</mark4><br>
And all its curtains of Aurorian <mark4>clouds</mark4><br>
Flush'd angerly: while sometimes eagle's <mark4>wings,</mark4><br>
Unseen before by Gods or wondering <mark4>men,</mark4><br>
Darken'd the place; and neighing steeds were <mark4>heard,</mark4><br>
Not heard before by Gods or wondering <mark1>men.</mark1><br>
Also, when he would taste the spicy <mark4>wreaths</mark4><br>
Of incense, breath'd aloft from sacred <mark4>hills,</mark4><br>
Instead of sweets, his ample palate <mark4>took</mark4><br>
Savour of poisonous brass and metal <mark4>sick:</mark4><br>
And so, when harbour'd in the sleepy <mark4>west,</mark4><br>
After the full completion of fair <mark1>day,--</mark1><br>
For rest divine upon exalted <mark4>couch</mark4><br>
And slumber in the arms of <mark4>melody,</mark4><br>
He pac'd away the pleasant hours of <mark4>ease</mark4><br>
With stride <mark4>colossal</mark4>, on from hall to <mark4>hall;</mark4><br>
While far within each aisle and deep <mark4>recess,</mark4><br>
His winged minions in close clusters <mark4>stood,</mark4><br>
Amaz'd and full of fear; like anxious <mark1>men</mark1><br>
Who on wide plains gather in panting <mark4>troops,</mark4><br>
When earthquakes jar their battlements and <mark4>towers.</mark4><br>
Even now, while Saturn, rous'd from icy <mark4>trance,</mark4><br>
Went step for step with Thea through the <mark1>woods,</mark1><br>
Hyperion, leaving twilight in the <mark1>rear,</mark1><br>
Came slope upon the threshold of the <mark1>west;</mark1><br>
Then, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope <br>
In smoothest silence, save what solemn <mark4>tubes,</mark4><br>
Blown by the serious Zephyrs, gave of <mark4>sweet</mark4><br>
And wandering <mark4>sounds</mark4>, slow-breathed <mark4>melodies;</mark4><br>
And like a rose in vermeil tint and <mark1>shape,</mark1><br>
In fragrance soft, and coolness to the <mark2>eye,</mark2><br>
That inlet to severe magnificence <br>
Stood full <mark4>blown</mark4>, for the God to enter <mark4>in.</mark4><br>
<br>
He enter'd, but he enter'd full of <mark4>wrath;</mark4><br>
His flaming robes stream'd out beyond his <mark4>heels,</mark4><br>
And gave a <mark4>roar</mark4>, as if of earthly <mark1>fire,</mark1><br>
That scar'd away the meek ethereal <mark4>Hours</mark4><br>
And made their dove-wings tremble. On he <mark4>flared,</mark4><br>
From stately nave to nave, from vault to <mark4>vault,</mark4><br>
Through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
And diamond-paved lustrous long <mark4>arcades,</mark4><br>
Until he reach'd the great main cupola; <br>
There standing fierce beneath, he stampt his <mark4>foot,</mark4><br>
And from the basements deep to the high <mark1>towers</mark1><br>
Jarr'd his own golden region; and <mark4>before</mark4><br>
The quavering thunder thereupon had <mark5>ceas'd,</mark5><br>
His voice leapt out, despite of godlike <mark4>curb,</mark4><br>
To this result: "O dreams of day and <mark1>night!</mark1><br>
O monstrous forms! O effigies of <mark1>pain!</mark1><br>
O spectres busy in a cold, cold <mark4>gloom!</mark4><br>
O lank-ear'd Phantoms of black-weeded <mark4>pools!</mark4><br>
Why do I know ye? why have I seen ye? <mark3>why</mark3><br>
Is my eternal essence thus <mark4>distraught</mark4><br>
To see and to behold these horrors <mark3>new?</mark3><br>
Saturn is fallen, am I too to <mark3>fall?</mark3><br>
Am I to leave this haven of my <mark1>rest,</mark1><br>
This cradle of my glory, this soft clime, <br>
This calm luxuriance of blissful <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
These crystalline pavilions, and pure fanes, <br>
Of all my lucent empire? It is <mark1>left</mark1><br>
Deserted, void, nor any haunt of <mark4>mine.</mark4><br>
The blaze, the splendour, and the <mark4>symmetry,</mark4><br>
I cannot see--but <mark1>darkness</mark1>, death and <mark4>darkness.</mark4><br>
Even here, into my centre of <mark4>repose,</mark4><br>
The shady visions come to <mark4>domineer,</mark4><br>
Insult, and blind, and stifle up my <mark4>pomp.--</mark4><br>
Fall!--No, by Tellus and her briny <mark4>robes!</mark4><br>
Over the fiery frontier of my <mark4>realms</mark4><br>
I will advance a terrible right <mark4>arm</mark4><br>
Shall scare that infant thunderer, rebel Jove, <br>
And bid old Saturn take his throne <mark4>again."--</mark4><br>
He spake, and ceas'd, the while a heavier <mark4>threat</mark4><br>
Held struggle with his throat but came not <mark1>forth;</mark1><br>
For as in the theatres of crowded <mark1>men</mark1><br>
Hubbub increases more they call out <mark4>"Hush!"</mark4><br>
So at Hyperion's words the Phantoms <mark1>pale</mark1><br>
Bestirr'd themselves, thrice horrible and <mark4>cold;</mark4><br>
And from the mirror'd level where he <mark1>stood</mark1><br>
A mist arose, as from a scummy <mark4>marsh.</mark4><br>
At this, through all his bulk an <mark4>agony</mark4><br>
Crept gradual, from the feet unto the <mark4>crown,</mark4><br>
Like a lithe serpent vast and <mark4>muscular</mark4><br>
Making slow way, with head and neck convuls'd <br>
From over-strained might. Releas'd, he <mark4>fled</mark4><br>
To the eastern gates, and full six dewy <mark1>hours</mark1><br>
Before the dawn in season due should <mark4>blush,</mark4><br>
He breath'd fierce breath against the sleepy <mark4>portals,</mark4><br>
Clear'd them of heavy vapours, burst them <mark4>wide</mark4><br>
Suddenly on the ocean's chilly <mark4>streams.</mark4><br>
The planet orb of fire, whereon he <mark4>rode</mark4><br>
Each day from east to west the heavens <mark3>through,</mark3><br>
Spun round in sable curtaining of <mark1>clouds;</mark1><br>
Nor therefore veiled quite, <mark4>blindfold</mark4>, and <mark4>hid,</mark4><br>
But ever and anon the glancing <mark4>spheres,</mark4><br>
Circles, and arcs, and broad-belting <mark5>colure,</mark5><br>
Glow'd through, and wrought upon the muffling <mark4>dark</mark4><br>
Sweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir <mark1>deep</mark1><br>
Up to the zenith,--hieroglyphics <mark4>old</mark4><br>
Which sages and keen-ey'd <mark4>astrologers</mark4><br>
Then living on the earth, with labouring <mark4>thought</mark4><br>
Won from the gaze of many <mark4>centuries:</mark4><br>
Now lost, save what we find on remnants <mark4>huge</mark4><br>
Of stone, or marble swart; their import <mark1>gone,</mark1><br>
Their wisdom long since fled.--Two wings this <mark4>orb</mark4><br>
Possess'd for glory, two fair argent <mark1>wings,</mark1><br>
Ever exalted at the God's <mark4>approach:</mark4><br>
And now, from forth the gloom their plumes <mark4>immense</mark4><br>
Rose, one by one, till all outspreaded <mark3>were;</mark3><br>
While still the dazzling globe maintain'd <mark4>eclipse,</mark4><br>
Awaiting for Hyperion's <mark1>command.</mark1><br>
Fain would he have commanded, fain took <mark4>throne</mark4><br>
And bid the day begin, if but for <mark4>change.</mark4><br>
He might not:--No, though a primeval <mark1>God:</mark1><br>
The sacred seasons might not be <mark4>disturb'd.</mark4><br>
Therefore the operations of the <mark4>dawn</mark4><br>
Stay'd in their birth, even as here 'tis <mark4>told.</mark4><br>
Those silver wings expanded sisterly, <br>
Eager to sail their orb; the porches <mark1>wide</mark1><br>
Open'd upon the dusk demesnes of <mark1>night;</mark1><br>
And the bright Titan, phrenzied with new <mark4>woes,</mark4><br>
Unus'd to bend, by hard compulsion <mark4>bent</mark4><br>
His spirit to the sorrow of the <mark4>time;</mark4><br>
And all along a dismal rack of <mark1>clouds,</mark1><br>
Upon the boundaries of day and <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
He stretch'd himself in grief and radiance <mark4>faint.</mark4><br>
There as he lay, the Heaven with its <mark1>stars</mark1><br>
Look'd down on him with pity, and the <mark1>voice</mark1><br>
Of Coelus, from the universal <mark1>space,</mark1><br>
Thus whisper'd low and solemn in his <mark1>ear.</mark1><br>
"O brightest of my children dear, <mark4>earth-born</mark4><br>
And sky-engendered, Son of <mark4>Mysteries</mark4><br>
All unrevealed even to the <mark4>powers</mark4><br>
Which met at thy creating; at whose <mark4>joys</mark4><br>
And palpitations <mark4>sweet</mark4>, and pleasures <mark4>soft,</mark4><br>
I, C{oe}lus, wonder, how they came and <mark4>whence;</mark4><br>
And at the fruits thereof what shapes they <mark1>be,</mark1><br>
Distinct, and visible; symbols <mark4>divine,</mark4><br>
Manifestations of that beauteous <mark4>life</mark4><br>
Diffus'd unseen throughout eternal <mark1>space:</mark1><br>
Of these new-form'd art thou, oh brightest <mark4>child!</mark4><br>
Of <mark4>these</mark4>, thy brethren and the <mark4>Goddesses!</mark4><br>
There is sad feud among ye, and <mark4>rebellion</mark4><br>
Of son against his sire. I saw him <mark1>fall,</mark1><br>
I saw my first-born tumbled from his <mark1>throne!</mark1><br>
To me his arms were spread, to me his <mark1>voice</mark1><br>
Found way from forth the thunders round his <mark1>head!</mark1><br>
Pale wox I, and in vapours hid my <mark1>face</mark1><br>
Art thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there <mark3>is:</mark3><br>
For I have seen my sons most unlike <mark1>Gods.</mark1><br>
Divine ye were created, and <mark1>divine</mark1><br>
In sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb'd, <br>
Unruffled, like high Gods, ye liv'd and <mark4>ruled:</mark4><br>
Now I behold in you fear, hope, and <mark1>wrath;</mark1><br>
Actions of rage and passion; even <mark4>as</mark4><br>
I see them, on the mortal world <mark4>beneath,</mark4><br>
In men who die.--This is the grief, O <mark4>Son!</mark4><br>
Sad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and <mark1>fall!</mark1><br>
Yet do thou strive; as thou art <mark4>capable,</mark4><br>
As thou canst move about, an evident <mark1>God;</mark1><br>
And canst oppose to each malignant <mark4>hour</mark4><br>
Ethereal presence:--I am but a <mark1>voice;</mark1><br>
My life is but the life of winds and <mark4>tides,</mark4><br>
No more than winds and tides can I <mark4>avail:--</mark4><br>
But thou canst.--Be thou therefore in the <mark4>van</mark4><br>
Of circumstance; yea, seize the arrow's <mark4>barb</mark4><br>
Before the tense string murmur.--To the <mark1>earth!</mark1><br>
For there thou wilt find Saturn and his <mark1>woes.</mark1><br>
Meanwhile I will keep watch on thy bright <mark4>sun,</mark4><br>
And of thy seasons be a careful <mark4>nurse."--</mark4><br>
Ere half this region-whisper had come <mark4>down,</mark4><br>
Hyperion <mark4>arose</mark4>, and on the <mark1>stars</mark1><br>
Lifted his curved lids, and kept them <mark1>wide</mark1><br>
Until it ceas'd; and still he kept them <mark1>wide:</mark1><br>
And still they were the same bright, patient <mark1>stars.</mark1><br>
Then with a slow incline of his broad <mark4>breast,</mark4><br>
Like to a diver in the pearly <mark1>seas,</mark1><br>
Forward he stoop'd over the airy <mark4>shore,</mark4><br>
And plung'd all noiseless into the deep <mark1>night.</mark1><br>
