Title : A Toccata of Galuppi's <br>
Author : Robert Browning <br><br>

<br>
Oh Galuppi, Baldassaro, this is very sad to <mark3>find!</mark3><br>
I can hardly misconceive you; it would prove me deaf and <mark3>blind;</mark3><br>
But although I take your meaning, 'tis with such a heavy <mark3>mind!</mark3><br>
<br>
Here you come with your old music, and here's all the good it <mark3>brings.</mark3><br>
What, they lived once thus at Venice where the merchants were the <mark3>kings,</mark3><br>
Where Saint Mark's <mark4>is</mark4>, where the Doges used to wed the sea with <mark3>rings?</mark3><br>
Ay, because the sea's the street there; and 'tis arched by . . . what you <mark4>call</mark4><br>
<br>
. . . Shylock's bridge with houses on it, where they kept the <mark4>carnival:</mark4><br>
I was never out of England--it's as if I saw it <mark4>all.</mark4><br>
Did young people take their pleasure when the sea was warm in <mark3>May?</mark3><br>
Balls and masks begun at midnight, burning ever to mid-day, <br>
<br>
When they made up fresh adventures for the morrow, do you <mark3>say?</mark3><br>
Was a lady such a lady, cheeks so round and lips so <mark4>red,--</mark4><br>
On her neck the small face buoyant, like a bell-flower on its <mark3>bed,</mark3><br>
O'er the breast's superb abundance where a man might base his <mark3>head?</mark3><br>
<br>
Well, and it was graceful of them--they'd break talk off and <mark4>afford</mark4><br>
--She, to bite her mask's black velvet--he, to finger on his <mark3>sword,</mark3><br>
While you sat and played Toccatas, stately at the <mark4>clavichord?</mark4><br>
What? Those lesser thirds so plaintive, sixths diminished, sigh on <mark3>sigh,</mark3><br>
<br>
Told them something? Those suspensions, those solutions--"Must we <mark3>die?"</mark3><br>
Those commiserating sevenths--"Life might last! we can but <mark3>try!</mark3><br>
"Were you happy?" --"Yes."--"And are you still as happy?"--"Yes. And <mark3>you?"</mark3><br>
--"Then, more kisses!"--"Did I stop them, when a million seemed so <mark3>few?"</mark3><br>
<br>
Hark, the dominant's persistence till it must be answered <mark3>to!</mark3><br>
So, an octave struck the answer. Oh, they praised you, I dare <mark1>say!</mark1><br>
"Brave Galuppi! that was music! good alike at grave and <mark3>gay!</mark3><br>
"I can always leave off talking when I hear a master <mark3>play!"</mark3><br>
<br>
Then they left you for their pleasure: till in due time, one by <mark3>one,</mark3><br>
Some with lives that came to nothing, some with deeds as well <mark3>undone,</mark3><br>
Death stepped tacitly and took them where they never see the <mark3>sun.</mark3><br>
But when I sit down to reason, think to take my stand nor <mark3>swerve,</mark3><br>
<br>
While I triumph o'er a secret wrung from nature's close <mark3>reserve,</mark3><br>
In you come with your cold music till I creep thro' every <mark3>nerve.</mark3><br>
Yes, you, like a ghostly cricket, creaking where a house was <mark4>burned:</mark4><br>
"Dust and ashes, dead and done with, Venice spent what Venice <mark3>earned.</mark3><br>
<br>
"The soul, doubtless, is immortal--where a soul can be <mark3>discerned.</mark3><br>
"Yours for instance: you know physics, something of <mark4>geology,</mark4><br>
"Mathematics are your pastime; souls shall rise in their <mark3>degree;</mark3><br>
"Butterflies may dread extinction,--you'll not die, it cannot <mark3>be!</mark3><br>
<br>
"As for Venice and her people, merely born to bloom and <mark3>drop,</mark3><br>
"Here on earth they bore their fruitage, mirth and folly were the <mark3>crop:</mark3><br>
"What of soul was left, I wonder, when the kissing had to <mark3>stop?</mark3><br>
"Dust and ashes!" So you creak it, and I want the heart to <mark4>scold.</mark4><br>
<br>
Dear dead women, with such hair, too--what's become of all the <mark3>gold</mark3><br>
Used to hang and brush their bosoms? I feel chilly and grown <mark3>old.</mark3><br>
