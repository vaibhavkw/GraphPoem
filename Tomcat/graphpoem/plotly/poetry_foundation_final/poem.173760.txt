Title : Easter Week <br>
Author : Joyce Kilmer <br><br>

(In memory of Joseph Mary <mark4>Plunkett)</mark4><br>
("Romantic Ireland's dead and <mark1>gone,</mark1><br>
It's with O'Leary in the <mark1>grave.")</mark1><br>
?William Butler <mark4>Yeats.</mark4><br>
"Romantic Ireland's dead and <mark1>gone,</mark1><br>
It's with O'Leary in the <mark1>grave."</mark1><br>
Then, Yeats, what gave that Easter <mark3>dawn</mark3><br>
A hue so radiantly <mark3>brave?</mark3><br>
<br>
There was a rain of blood that day,<br>
Red rain in gay blue April <mark3>weather.</mark3><br>
It blessed the earth till it gave birth<br>
To valour thick as blooms of <mark3>heather.</mark3><br>
<br>
Romantic Ireland never <mark4>dies!</mark4><br>
O'Leary lies in fertile <mark3>ground,</mark3><br>
And songs and spears throughout the <mark4>years</mark4><br>
Rise up where patriot graves are <mark3>found.</mark3><br>
<br>
Immortal patriots newly <mark4>dead</mark4><br>
And ye that bled in bygone <mark1>years,</mark1><br>
What banners rise before your <mark4>eyes?</mark4><br>
What is the tune that greets your <mark4>ears?</mark4><br>
<br>
The young Republic's banners <mark4>smile</mark4><br>
For many a mile where troops <mark4>convene.</mark4><br>
O'Connell street is loudly <mark4>sweet</mark4><br>
With strains of Wearing of the <mark3>Green.</mark3><br>
<br>
The soil of Ireland throbs and <mark4>glows</mark4><br>
With life that knows the hour is <mark4>here</mark4><br>
To strike again like Irishmen<br>
For that which Irishmen hold <mark4>dear.</mark4><br>
<br>
Lord Edward leaves his resting <mark4>place</mark4><br>
And Sarsfield's face is glad and <mark4>fierce.</mark4><br>
See Emmet leap from troubled sleep<br>
To grasp the hand of Padraic <mark4>Pearse!</mark4><br>
<br>
There is no rope can strangle song<br>
And not for long death takes his <mark4>toll.</mark4><br>
No prison bars can dim the <mark4>stars</mark4><br>
Nor quicklime eat the living <mark3>soul.</mark3><br>
<br>
Romantic Ireland is not <mark4>old.</mark4><br>
For years untold her youth shall <mark4>shine.</mark4><br>
Her heart is fed on Heavenly <mark4>bread,</mark4><br>
The blood of martyrs is her <mark3>wine.</mark3><br>
