Title : The Gardener 38 <br>
Author : Rabindranath Tagore <br><br>

<br>
My love, once upon a time your poet launched a great epic in his mind.<br>
Alas, I was not careful, and it struck your ringing anklets and came to grief.<br>
It broke up into scraps of songs and lay scattered at your feet.<br>
All my cargo of the stories of old wars was tossed by the laughing waves and soaked in tears and sank.<br>
You must make this loss good to me, my <mark4>love.</mark4><br>
If my claims to immortal fame after death are shattered, make me immortal while I <mark4>live.</mark4><br>
And I will not mourn for my loss nor blame you.<br>
