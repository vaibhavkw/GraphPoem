Title : John Henry <br>
Author : Anonymous <br><br>

When John Henry was a little tiny <mark4>baby</mark4><br>
Sitting on his mama's <mark3>knee,</mark3><br>
He picked up a hammer and a little piece of <mark4>steel</mark4><br>
Saying, "Hammer's going to be the death of me, <mark1>Lord</mark1>, <mark1>Lord,</mark1><br>
Hammer's going to be the death of <mark3>me."</mark3><br>
<br>
John Henry was a man just six feet high, <br>
Nearly two feet and a half across his <mark3>breast.</mark3><br>
He'd hammer with a nine-pound hammer all <mark3>day</mark3><br>
And never get tired and want to rest, <mark1>Lord</mark1>, <mark1>Lord,</mark1><br>
And never get tired and want to <mark3>rest.</mark3><br>
<br>
John Henry went up on the <mark4>mountain</mark4><br>
And he looked one eye straight up its <mark4>side.</mark4><br>
The mountain was so tall and John Henry was so <mark4>small,</mark4><br>
He laid down his hammer and he cried, <mark2>"Lord</mark2>, <mark1>Lord,"</mark1><br>
He laid down his hammer and he <mark4>cried.</mark4><br>
<br>
John Henry said to his <mark4>captain,</mark4><br>
<mark4>"Captain</mark4>, you go to <mark4>town,</mark4><br>
Bring me back a TWELVE-pound hammer, please, <br>
And I'll beat that steam drill down, <mark1>Lord</mark1>, <mark1>Lord,</mark1><br>
I'll beat that steam drill <mark3>down."</mark3><br>
<br>
The captain said to John <mark4>Henry,</mark4><br>
"I believe this mountain's sinking <mark4>in."</mark4><br>
But John Henry said, "Captain, just you stand <mark4>aside--</mark4><br>
It's nothing but my hammer catching wind, <mark1>Lord</mark1>, <mark1>Lord,</mark1><br>
It's nothing but my hammer catching <mark4>wind."</mark4><br>
<br>
John Henry said to his shaker, <br>
"Shaker, boy, you better start to <mark3>pray,</mark3><br>
'Cause if my TWELVE-pound hammer miss that little piece of <mark1>steel,</mark1><br>
Tomorrow'll be your burying day, <mark1>Lord</mark1>, <mark1>Lord,</mark1><br>
Tomorrow'll be your burying <mark1>day."</mark1><br>
<br>
John Henry said to his <mark1>captain,</mark1><br>
"A man is nothing but a <mark4>man,</mark4><br>
But before I let your steam drill beat me <mark1>down,</mark1><br>
I'd die with a hammer in my hand, <mark1>Lord</mark1>, <mark1>Lord,</mark1><br>
I'd die with a hammer in my <mark4>hand."</mark4><br>
<br>
The man that invented the steam <mark4>drill,</mark4><br>
He figured he was mighty high and <mark4>fine,</mark4><br>
But John Henry sunk the steel down fourteen <mark4>feet</mark4><br>
While the steam drill only made nine, <mark1>Lord</mark1>, <mark1>Lord,</mark1><br>
The steam drill only made <mark3>nine.</mark3><br>
<br>
John Henry hammered on the right-hand <mark1>side.</mark1><br>
Steam drill kept driving on the <mark4>left.</mark4><br>
John Henry beat that steam drill <mark1>down.</mark1><br>
But he hammered his poor heart to death, <mark1>Lord</mark1>, <mark1>Lord,</mark1><br>
    He hammered his poor heart to death. <br>
<br>
<mark4>Well</mark4>, they carried John Henry down the <mark4>tunnel</mark4><br>
And they laid his body in the <mark4>sand.</mark4><br>
Now every woman riding on a C and O <mark4>train</mark4><br>
Says, "There lies my steel-driving man, <mark1>Lord</mark1>, <mark1>Lord,</mark1><br>
There lies my steel-driving <mark1>man."</mark1><br>
