Title : Movement Song <br>
Author : Audre Lorde <br><br>

I have studied the tight curls on the back of your neck   <br>
moving away from <mark1>me</mark1><br>
beyond anger or <mark4>failure</mark4><br>
your face in the evening schools of <mark4>longing</mark4><br>
through mornings of wish and <mark4>ripen</mark4><br>
we were always saying <mark5>goodbye</mark5><br>
in the blood in the bone over coffee <br>
before dashing for elevators <mark4>going</mark4><br>
in opposite <mark4>directions</mark4><br>
without <mark4>goodbyes.</mark4><br>
<br>
Do not remember me as a bridge nor a roof   <br>
as the maker of <mark4>legends</mark4><br>
nor as a trap <br>
door to that <mark4>world</mark4><br>
where black and white clericals <br>
hang on the edge of beauty in five oclock <mark4>elevators</mark4><br>
twitching their shoulders to avoid other flesh   <br>
and now <br>
there is someone to speak for <mark4>them</mark4><br>
moving away from me into <mark4>tomorrows</mark4><br>
morning of wish and <mark1>ripen</mark1><br>
your goodbye is a promise of <mark4>lightning</mark4><br>
in the last angels <mark4>hand</mark4><br>
unwelcome and <mark4>warning</mark4><br>
the sands have run out against <mark4>us</mark4><br>
we were rewarded by <mark4>journeys</mark4><br>
away from each <mark4>other</mark4><br>
into <mark4>desire</mark4><br>
into mornings <mark4>alone</mark4><br>
where excuse and endurance mingle   <br>
conceiving <mark4>decision.</mark4><br>
Do not remember <mark1>me</mark1><br>
as <mark4>disaster</mark4><br>
nor as the keeper of <mark4>secrets</mark4><br>
I am a fellow rider in the cattle <mark4>cars</mark4><br>
<br>
you move slowly out of my <mark4>bed</mark4><br>
saying we cannot waste <mark4>time</mark4><br>
only <mark4>ourselves.</mark4><br>
