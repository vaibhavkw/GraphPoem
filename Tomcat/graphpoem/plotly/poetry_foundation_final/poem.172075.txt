Title : Debtor's Prison Road <br>
Author : Heather McHugh <br><br>

<br>
They let me go <br>
at night, minus my timepiece, lighter,   <br>
personal effects. The air is always <mark4>shaking</mark4><br>
the same jars of safety pins: <mark4>cicadas.</mark4><br>
Song is my recidivism: <mark4>always</mark4><br>
I'm abandoning the road to stand <br>
(unwatched, unseconded) in <mark4>someone's</mark4><br>
field. The stars (that are not mine) <br>
tick fitfully, they always <mark4>have</mark4><br>
<br>
appointments. Punctual, <mark4>six-sharp,</mark4><br>
they are <mark4>David's</mark4>, they have lodged in <mark4>his</mark4><br>
death tent, have stuck in his mud sleep. Bad luck <br>
leaves me a loan: no company, no <mark4>katy-</mark4><br>
<br>
did or <mark4>promissory</mark4><br>
note or <mark4>night</mark4><br>
can <mark4>last.</mark4><br>
The air <br>
loses its <mark4>nerve,</mark4><br>
the old saw its eyeteeth and <mark3>I</mark3><br>
my words--my alwaysing and <mark3>my.</mark3><br>
In hush the repossessors reach   <br>
<br>
the edges of the field. They pass <br>
<br>
for shadows, sheep of ambush, animals <mark4>of</mark4><br>
permanence. They turn a black beyond <mark4>returning</mark4><br>
<br>
and they haunt the sleepless. I don't <mark4>count,</mark4><br>
who cannot earn my <mark4>keep.</mark4><br>
