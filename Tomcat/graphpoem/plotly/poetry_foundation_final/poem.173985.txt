Title : Departure <br>
Author : Edna St. Vincent Millay <br><br>

It's little I care what path I <mark3>take,</mark3><br>
And where it leads it's little I <mark4>care;</mark4><br>
But out of this house, lest my heart <mark3>break,</mark3><br>
I must go, and off <mark4>somewhere.</mark4><br>
<br>
It's little I know what's in my <mark3>heart,</mark3><br>
What's in my mind it's little I <mark3>know,</mark3><br>
But there's that in me must up and <mark3>start,</mark3><br>
And it's little I care where my feet <mark3>go.</mark3><br>
<br>
I wish I could walk for a day and a <mark4>night,</mark4><br>
And find me at dawn in a desolate <mark3>place</mark3><br>
With never the rut of a road in <mark3>sight,</mark3><br>
Nor the roof of a <mark4>house</mark4>, nor the eyes of a <mark3>face.</mark3><br>
<br>
I wish I could walk till my blood should <mark4>spout,</mark4><br>
And drop me, never to stir <mark3>again,</mark3><br>
On a shore that is wide, for the tide is <mark3>out,</mark3><br>
And the weedy rocks are bare to the <mark3>rain.</mark3><br>
<br>
But dump or <mark4>dock</mark4>, where the path I <mark1>take</mark1><br>
Brings up, it's little enough I <mark1>care;</mark1><br>
And it's little I'd mind the fuss they'll <mark3>make,</mark3><br>
Huddled dead in a ditch <mark1>somewhere.</mark1><br>
<br>
"Is something the matter, dear," she <mark3>said,</mark3><br>
"That you sit at your work so silently?"  <br>
"No, mother, no, 'twas a knot in my <mark3>thread.</mark3><br>
 There goes the kettle, I'll make the tea."  <br>
