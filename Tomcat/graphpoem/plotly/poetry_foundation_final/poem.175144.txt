Title : Ode, Inscribed to William H. Channing <br>
Author : Ralph Waldo Emerson <br><br>

Though loath to <mark3>grieve</mark3><br>
The evil time's sole <mark4>patriot,</mark4><br>
I cannot <mark3>leave</mark3><br>
My honied <mark4>thought</mark4><br>
For the priest's <mark4>cant,</mark4><br>
Or statesman's <mark3>rant.</mark3><br>
<br>
If I <mark3>refuse</mark3><br>
My study for their politique, <br>
Which at the best is <mark4>trick,</mark4><br>
The angry <mark3>Muse</mark3><br>
Puts confusion in my <mark4>brain.</mark4><br>
<br>
But who is he that prates <br>
Of the culture of <mark4>mankind,</mark4><br>
Of better arts and <mark3>life?</mark3><br>
Go, blindworm, go, <br>
Behold the famous <mark4>States</mark4><br>
Harrying Mexico <br>
With rifle and with <mark3>knife!</mark3><br>
<br>
Or who, with accent <mark3>bolder,</mark3><br>
Dare praise the freedom-loving <mark4>mountaineer?</mark4><br>
I found by thee, O rushing Contoocook! <br>
And in thy valleys, Agiochook! <br>
The jackals of the <mark3>negro-holder.</mark3><br>
<br>
The God who made New <mark4>Hampshire</mark4><br>
Taunted the lofty <mark4>land</mark4><br>
With little men; <mark4>--</mark4><br>
Small bat and <mark3>wren</mark3><br>
House in the oak: <mark4>--</mark4><br>
If earth-fire <mark3>cleave</mark3><br>
The upheaved land, and bury the <mark3>folk,</mark3><br>
The southern crocodile would <mark1>grieve.</mark1><br>
Virtue palters; Right is <mark4>hence;</mark4><br>
Freedom <mark4>praised</mark4>, but <mark4>hid;</mark4><br>
Funeral <mark4>eloquence</mark4><br>
Rattles the <mark3>coffin-lid.</mark3><br>
<br>
What boots thy <mark4>zeal,</mark4><br>
O glowing <mark4>friend,</mark4><br>
That would indignant rend <br>
The northland from the south? <br>
Wherefore? to what good <mark3>end?</mark3><br>
Boston Bay and Bunker <mark4>Hill</mark4><br>
Would serve things still; <mark3>--</mark3><br>
Things are of the <mark4>snake.</mark4><br>
<br>
The horseman serves the <mark4>horse,</mark4><br>
The neat-herd serves the <mark4>neat,</mark4><br>
The merchant serves the <mark4>purse,</mark4><br>
The eater serves his <mark3>meat;</mark3><br>
'T is the day of the <mark4>chattel</mark4><br>
Web to weave, and corn to <mark4>grind;</mark4><br>
Things are in the <mark4>saddle,</mark4><br>
And ride <mark1>mankind.</mark1><br>
<br>
There are two laws <mark3>discrete,</mark3><br>
Not <mark4>reconciled,--</mark4><br>
Law for man, and law for thing;<br>
The last builds town and <mark3>fleet,</mark3><br>
But it runs <mark4>wild,</mark4><br>
And doth the man unking.<br>
<br>
'T is fit the forest <mark4>fall,</mark4><br>
The steep be <mark4>graded,</mark4><br>
The mountain tunnelled,<br>
The sand <mark3>shaded,</mark3><br>
The orchard <mark4>planted,</mark4><br>
The glebe tilled,<br>
The prairie <mark3>granted,</mark3><br>
The steamer <mark4>built.</mark4><br>
<br>
Let man serve law for <mark4>man;</mark4><br>
Live for friendship, live for <mark4>love,</mark4><br>
For truth's and harmony's behoof;<br>
The state may follow how it <mark3>can,</mark3><br>
As Olympus follows Jove.<br>
<br>
Yet do not I <mark4>implore</mark4><br>
The wrinkled shopman to my sounding <mark4>woods,</mark4><br>
Nor bid the unwilling <mark4>senator</mark4><br>
Ask votes of thrushes in the solitudes. <br>
Every one to his chosen work; <mark4>--</mark4><br>
Foolish hands may mix and <mark4>mar;</mark4><br>
Wise and sure the issues <mark3>are.</mark3><br>
Round they roll till dark is <mark4>light,</mark4><br>
Sex to sex, and even to odd; <mark4>--</mark4><br>
The <mark3>over-god</mark3><br>
Who marries Right to <mark3>Might,</mark3><br>
Who peoples, unpeoples, -- <br>
He who <mark4>exterminates</mark4><br>
Races by stronger <mark4>races,</mark4><br>
Black by white faces, <mark3>--</mark3><br>
Knows to bring honey <br>
Out of the <mark4>lion;</mark4><br>
Grafts gentlest <mark3>scion</mark3><br>
On pirate and <mark3>Turk.</mark3><br>
<br>
The Cossack eats <mark4>Poland,</mark4><br>
Like stolen <mark4>fruit;</mark4><br>
Her last noble is <mark4>ruined,</mark4><br>
Her last poet <mark3>mute;</mark3><br>
Straight into double <mark4>band</mark4><br>
The victors <mark4>divide;</mark4><br>
Half for freedom strike and stand; <mark4>--</mark4><br>
The astonished Muse finds thousands at her <mark4>side.</mark4><br>
