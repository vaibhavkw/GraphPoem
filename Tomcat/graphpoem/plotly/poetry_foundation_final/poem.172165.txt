Title : That Evening at Dinner <br>
Author : David Ferry <br><br>

By the last few times we saw her it was <mark4>clear</mark4><br>
That things were different. When you tried to help her   <br>
Get out of the car or get from the car to the <mark4>door</mark4><br>
Or across the apartment house hall to the <mark4>elevator</mark4><br>
There was a new sense of heaviness   <br>
Or of inertia in the body. It <mark4>wasn't</mark4><br>
That she was less willing to be helped to <mark4>walk</mark4><br>
But that the walking itself had become less <mark4>willing.</mark4><br>
Maybe the stupid demogorgon <mark4>blind</mark4><br>
Recalcitrance of body, resentful of the <mark4>laws</mark4><br>
Of mind and spirit, was getting its own back <mark1>now,</mark1><br>
Or maybe a new and subtle, <mark4>alien,</mark4><br>
Intelligence of body was obedient <mark1>now</mark1><br>
To other laws: "Weight is the measure <mark1>of</mark1><br>
The force with which a body is drawn <mark4>downward</mark4><br>
To the center of the earth"; "Inertia <mark4>is</mark4><br>
The tendency of a body to <mark4>resist</mark4><br>
Proceeding to its fate in any <mark3>way</mark3><br>
Other than that determined for itself." <br>
<br>
That evening, at the Bromells' apartment, <mark4>after</mark4><br>
She had been carried up through the rational <mark4>structure</mark4><br>
By articulate stages, floor after flashing <mark3>floor,</mark3><br>
And after we helped her get across the <mark4>hall,</mark4><br>
And get across the room to a chair, somehow   <br>
We got her seated in a chair that was <mark4>placed</mark4><br>
A little too far away from the nearest <mark4>table,</mark4><br>
At the edge of the abyss, and there she <mark4>sat,</mark4><br>
Exposed, her body the object of our <mark4>attention--</mark4><br>
The heaviness of it, the helpless graceless leg, <br>
The thick stocking, the leg brace, the medical <mark3>shoe.</mark3><br>
<br>
At work between herself and us there <mark4>was</mark4><br>
A new principle of social <mark4>awkwardness</mark4><br>
And skillfulness required of each of <mark4>us.</mark4><br>
Our tones of voice in this easy <mark4>conversation</mark4><br>
Were instruments of marvelous <mark3>finesse,</mark3><br>
Measuring and maintaining with <mark4>exactitude</mark4><br>
"The fact or condition of the <mark4>difference</mark4><br>
There was between us, both in space and <mark4>time."</mark4><br>
<br>
Her smiling made her look as if she <mark4>had</mark4><br>
Just then tasted something delicious, the <mark4>charm</mark4><br>
Her courtesy attributed to her <mark4>friends.</mark4><br>
<br>
This decent elegant fellow human <mark4>being</mark4><br>
Was seated in virtue, character, <mark4>disability,</mark4><br>
Behind her the order of the ranged <mark4>bookshelves,</mark4><br>
The windows monitored by Venetian <mark4>blinds--</mark4><br>
"These can be raised or lowered; numerous <mark4>slats,</mark4><br>
Horizontally arranged, and <mark4>parallel,</mark4><br>
Which can be tilted so as to <mark4>admit</mark4><br>
Precisely the desired light or <mark4>air."</mark4><br>
<br>
We were all her friends, Maggie, and Bill, and <mark4>Anne,</mark4><br>
And I, and the nice Boston Brahmin elderly <mark3>man</mark3><br>
Named <mark4>Duncan</mark4>, utterly friendly and <mark4>benign.</mark4><br>
And of course it wasn't whether or not the <mark4>world</mark4><br>
Was benign but whether it looked at her too <mark1>much.</mark1><br>
She wasn't "painfully shy" but just the <mark4>same</mark4><br>
I wouldn't be surprised if there had <mark4>been</mark4><br>
Painfulness in her shyness earlier <mark4>on,</mark4><br>
Say at dancing school. Like others, though, she <mark1>had</mark1><br>
Survived her childhood somehow. Nor do I <mark4>mean</mark4><br>
She was unhappy. Maybe more or less <mark3>so</mark3><br>
Before her marriage. One had the sense of <mark4>trips</mark4><br>
Arranged, committees, concerts, baffled <mark4>courage</mark4><br>
Living it through, giving it order and <mark4>style.</mark4><br>
And one had the sense of the late marriage as <mark1>of</mark1><br>
Two bafflements inventing the sense they <mark4>made</mark4><br>
Together. The marriage <mark4>seemed</mark4>, to the outside <mark1>world,</mark1><br>
And probably was, radiant and <mark4>triumphant,</mark4><br>
And I think that one could almost certainly <mark3>say</mark3><br>
That during the last, heroic, phase of <mark4>things,</mark4><br>
After his death, and after the stroke, she <mark1>had</mark1><br>
By force of character and careful <mark4>management,</mark4><br>
Maintained a certain degree of <mark4>happiness.</mark4><br>
<br>
The books there on the bookshelves told their <mark4>stories,</mark4><br>
Line after line, all of them evenly <mark4>spaced,</mark4><br>
And spaces between the <mark4>words</mark4>, You could fall through the <mark4>spaces.</mark4><br>
In one of the books Dr. Johnson told the <mark4>story:</mark4><br>
"In the scale of being, wherever it <mark4>begins,</mark4><br>
Or ends, there are chasms infinitely deep;   <br>
Infinite vacuities ... For <mark4>surely,</mark4><br>
Nothing can so disturb the passions, <mark4>or</mark4><br>
Perplex the intellects of man so <mark1>much,</mark1><br>
As the disruption of this union with   <br>
Visible nature, separation from <mark4>all</mark4><br>
That has delighted or engaged him, a <mark4>change</mark4><br>
Not only of the place but of the <mark3>manner</mark3><br>
Of his being, an entrance into a <mark4>state</mark4><br>
Not simply which he knows not, but <mark4>perhaps</mark4><br>
A state he has not faculties to <mark3>know."</mark3><br>
<br>
The dinner was delicious, fresh <mark4>greens</mark4>, and <mark4>reds,</mark4><br>
And yellows, produce of the season <mark3>due,</mark3><br>
And fish from the nearby sea; and there were also   <br>
Ashes to be eaten, and dirt to <mark4>drink.</mark4><br>
