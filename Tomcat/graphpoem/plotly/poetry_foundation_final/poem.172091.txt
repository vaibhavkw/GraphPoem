Title : A Penitent Considers Another Coming of Mary <br>
Author : Gwendolyn Brooks <br><br>

For Reverend Theodore <mark4>Richardson</mark4><br>
If Mary came would Mary   <br>
Forgive, as Mothers <mark3>may,</mark3><br>
And sad and second Saviour   <br>
Furnish us <mark3>today?</mark3><br>
<br>
She would not shake her head and leave   <br>
This military <mark3>air,</mark3><br>
But ratify a modern <mark3>hay,</mark3><br>
And put her Baby <mark3>there.</mark3><br>
<br>
Mary would not punish <mark4>men--</mark4><br>
If Mary came <mark3>again.</mark3><br>
