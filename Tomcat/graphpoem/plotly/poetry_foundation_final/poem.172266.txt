Title : Burning Trash <br>
Author : John Updike <br><br>

At night?the light turned off, the <mark4>filament</mark4><br>
Unburdened of its atom-eating charge, <br>
His wife asleep, her breathing dipping low<br>
To touch a swampy source?he thought of death. <br>
Her father's hilltop home allowed him time <br>
To sense the nothing standing like a <mark4>sheet</mark4><br>
Of speckless glass behind his human <mark4>future.</mark4><br>
He had two comforts he could see, just two.<br>
<br>
One was the cheerful fullness of most <mark4>things:</mark4><br>
Plump stones and clouds, expectant pods, the soil <br>
Offering up pressure to his knees and <mark4>hands.</mark4><br>
The other was burning the trash each day. <br>
He liked the heat, the imitation <mark4>danger,</mark4><br>
And the way, as he tossed in used-up <mark4>news,</mark4><br>
String, napkins, <mark4>envelopes</mark4>, and paper <mark4>cups,</mark4><br>
Hypnotic tongues of order intervened.<br>
