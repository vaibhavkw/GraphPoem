Title : Skin Cancer <br>
Author : Mark Jarman <br><br>

Balmy overcast nights of late <mark4>September;</mark4><br>
Palms standing out in street <mark1>light</mark1>, house <mark1>light;</mark1><br>
Full moon penetrating the <mark4>cloud-film</mark4><br>
With an explosive halo, a ring almost half the sky;   <br>
Air like a towel draped over <mark4>shoulders;</mark4><br>
Lightness or gravity deferred like a moral <mark4>question;</mark4><br>
The incense in the house lit; the young <mark4>people</mark4><br>
Moving from the front door into the <mark4>half-dark</mark4><br>
And back, or up the stairs to glimpse the lovers' <mark4>shoes</mark4><br>
Outside the master bedroom; the youngest <mark4>speculating;</mark4><br>
The taste of beer, familiar as salt <mark4>water;</mark4><br>
Each window holding a sea view, <mark4>charcoal</mark4><br>
With shifting bars of white; the fog filling <mark4>in</mark4><br>
Like the haze of distance itself, pushing close, <mark4>blurring.</mark4><br>
<br>
As if the passage into life were through such <mark4>houses,</mark4><br>
Surrounded by some version of ocean <mark4>weather,</mark4><br>
Lit beads of fog or wind so stripped it burns the <mark4>throat;</mark4><br>
Mildew-spreading, spray-laden breezes and the beach <mark4>sun</mark4><br>
Making each grain of stucco cast a shadow; <br>
An ideal landscape sheared of its nostalgia; <br>
S. with his black hair, buck teeth, unsunned <mark4>skin,</mark4><br>
Joking and disappearing; F. doing exactly the <mark4>same</mark4><br>
But dying, a corkscrew motion through green <mark1>water;</mark1><br>
And C. not looking back from the car door, <br>
Reappearing beside the East River, rich, owned, smiling at <mark4>last.</mark4><br>
<br>
Swains. and nymphs. And news that came with the sea <mark4>damp,</mark4><br>
Of steady pipe-corrosions, black <mark4>corners,</mark4><br>
Moisture working through sand lots, through slab <mark4>floors,</mark4><br>
Slowly, with chemical, with molecular intricacy, <br>
Then, bursting alive: the shrieked <mark4>confessions</mark4><br>
Of the wild parents; the cliff collapse; the <mark4>kidnap;</mark4><br>
The cache of photos; the letter; the weapon; the haunted <mark4>dream;</mark4><br>
The sudden close-up of the loved one's <mark4>degradation.</mark4><br>
<br>
Weather a part of it all, permeating and sanctifying,   <br>
Infiltrating and destroying; the sun <mark4>disc,</mark4><br>
Cool behind the veil of afternoon <mark5>cloud,</mark5><br>
With sun spots like flies crawling across <mark4>it;</mark4><br>
The slow empurpling of skin all <mark4>summer;</mark4><br>
The glorious learned flesh and the rich pallor   <br>
Of the untouched places in the first nakedness;   <br>
The working of the lesion now in late life,   <br>
Soon to be known by the body, even the <mark4>one</mark4><br>
Enduring the bareness of the inland <mark4>plains,</mark4><br>
The cold fronts out of Canada, a sickness   <br>
For home that feels no different from health. <br>
