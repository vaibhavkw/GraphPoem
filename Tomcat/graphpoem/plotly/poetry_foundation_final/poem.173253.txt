Title : The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (text of 1834) <br>
Author : Samuel Taylor Coleridge <br><br>

Argument  How a Ship having passed the Line was driven by storms to the cold Country towards the South Pole; and how from thence she made her course to the tropical Latitude of the Great Pacific Ocean; and of the strange things that befell; and in what manner the Ancyent Marinere came back to his own <mark4>Country.</mark4><br>
PART <mark2>I</mark2><br>
It is an ancient <mark1>Mariner,</mark1><br>
And he stoppeth one of <mark3>three.</mark3><br>
'By thy long grey beard and glittering <mark2>eye,</mark2><br>
Now wherefore stopp'st thou <mark3>me?</mark3><br>
<br>
The Bridegroom's doors are opened <mark4>wide,</mark4><br>
And I am next of <mark3>kin;</mark3><br>
The guests are <mark3>met</mark3>, the feast is <mark3>set:</mark3><br>
May'st hear the merry <mark3>din.'</mark3><br>
<br>
He holds him with his skinny <mark4>hand,</mark4><br>
'There was a ship,' quoth <mark3>he.</mark3><br>
'Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard <mark4>loon!'</mark4><br>
Eftsoons his hand dropt <mark1>he.</mark1><br>
<br>
He holds him with his glittering <mark1>eye--</mark1><br>
The Wedding-Guest stood <mark3>still,</mark3><br>
And listens like a three years' <mark4>child:</mark4><br>
The Mariner hath his <mark3>will.</mark3><br>
<br>
The Wedding-Guest sat on a <mark4>stone:</mark4><br>
He cannot choose but <mark1>hear;</mark1><br>
And thus spake on that ancient <mark4>man,</mark4><br>
The bright-eyed <mark1>Mariner.</mark1><br>
<br>
'The ship was <mark3>cheered</mark3>, the harbour <mark4>cleared,</mark4><br>
Merrily did we <mark3>drop</mark3><br>
Below the kirk, below the <mark3>hill,</mark3><br>
Below the lighthouse <mark3>top.</mark3><br>
<br>
The Sun came up upon the <mark4>left,</mark4><br>
Out of the sea came <mark1>he!</mark1><br>
And he shone <mark3>bright</mark3>, and on the <mark4>right</mark4><br>
Went down into the <mark3>sea.</mark3><br>
<br>
Higher and higher every <mark3>day,</mark3><br>
Till over the mast at <mark4>noon--'</mark4><br>
The Wedding-Guest here beat his <mark4>breast,</mark4><br>
For he heard the loud <mark3>bassoon.</mark3><br>
<br>
The bride hath paced into the <mark4>hall,</mark4><br>
Red as a rose is <mark3>she;</mark3><br>
Nodding their heads before her <mark4>goes</mark4><br>
The merry minstrelsy. <br>
<br>
The Wedding-Guest he beat his <mark1>breast,</mark1><br>
Yet he cannot choose but <mark1>hear;</mark1><br>
And thus spake on that ancient <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
The bright-eyed <mark1>Mariner.</mark1><br>
<br>
And now the STORM-BLAST came, and <mark1>he</mark1><br>
Was tyrannous and <mark3>strong:</mark3><br>
He struck with his o'ertaking <mark4>wings,</mark4><br>
And chased us south <mark3>along.</mark3><br>
<br>
With sloping masts and dipping <mark3>prow,</mark3><br>
As who pursued with yell and <mark3>blow</mark3><br>
Still treads the shadow of his <mark3>foe,</mark3><br>
And forward bends his <mark4>head,</mark4><br>
The ship drove <mark3>fast</mark3>, loud roared the <mark4>blast,</mark4><br>
And southward aye we <mark3>fled.</mark3><br>
<br>
And now there came both mist and <mark3>snow,</mark3><br>
And it grew wondrous <mark4>cold:</mark4><br>
And ice, <mark3>mast-high</mark3>, came floating <mark3>by,</mark3><br>
As green as <mark4>emerald.</mark4><br>
<br>
And through the drifts the snowy clifts <br>
Did send a dismal <mark4>sheen:</mark4><br>
Nor shapes of men nor beasts we <mark4>ken--</mark4><br>
The ice was all <mark4>between.</mark4><br>
<br>
The ice was <mark4>here</mark4>, the ice was <mark4>there,</mark4><br>
The ice was all <mark4>around:</mark4><br>
It cracked and <mark3>growled</mark3>, and roared and <mark4>howled,</mark4><br>
Like noises in a <mark1>swound!</mark1><br>
<br>
At length did cross an <mark4>Albatross,</mark4><br>
Thorough the fog it <mark3>came;</mark3><br>
As if it had been a Christian <mark4>soul,</mark4><br>
We hailed it in God's <mark3>name.</mark3><br>
<br>
It ate the food it ne'er had <mark4>eat,</mark4><br>
And round and round it <mark5>flew.</mark5><br>
The ice did split with a <mark4>thunder-fit;</mark4><br>
The helmsman steered us <mark3>through!</mark3><br>
<br>
And a good south wind sprung up <mark4>behind;</mark4><br>
The Albatross did <mark1>follow,</mark1><br>
And every <mark3>day</mark3>, for food or <mark3>play,</mark3><br>
Came to the mariner's <mark3>hollo!</mark3><br>
<br>
In mist or <mark3>cloud</mark3>, on mast or <mark4>shroud,</mark4><br>
It perched for vespers <mark4>nine;</mark4><br>
Whiles all the <mark3>night</mark3>, through fog-smoke <mark4>white,</mark4><br>
Glimmered the white <mark4>Moon-shine.'</mark4><br>
<br>
'God save thee, ancient <mark1>Mariner!</mark1><br>
From the fiends, that plague thee <mark4>thus!--</mark4><br>
Why look'st thou so?'--With my <mark3>cross-bow</mark3><br>
I shot the <mark1>ALBATROSS.</mark1><br>
<br>
PART II <br>
The Sun now rose upon the <mark1>right:</mark1><br>
Out of the sea came <mark1>he,</mark1><br>
Still hid in <mark4>mist</mark4>, and on the <mark1>left</mark1><br>
Went down into the <mark1>sea.</mark1><br>
<br>
And the good south wind still blew <mark1>behind,</mark1><br>
But no sweet bird did <mark1>follow,</mark1><br>
Nor any day for food or <mark1>play</mark1><br>
Came to the mariner's <mark1>hollo!</mark1><br>
<br>
And I had done a hellish <mark4>thing,</mark4><br>
And it would work 'em <mark3>woe:</mark3><br>
For all averred, I had killed the <mark4>bird</mark4><br>
That made the breeze to <mark1>blow.</mark1><br>
Ah wretch! said <mark3>they</mark3>, the bird to <mark3>slay,</mark3><br>
That made the breeze to <mark1>blow!</mark1><br>
<br>
Nor dim nor <mark3>red</mark3>, like God's own <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
The glorious Sun <mark5>uprist:</mark5><br>
Then all averred, I had killed the <mark1>bird</mark1><br>
That brought the fog and <mark4>mist.</mark4><br>
'Twas right, said <mark3>they</mark3>, such birds to <mark1>slay,</mark1><br>
That bring the fog and <mark1>mist.</mark1><br>
<br>
The fair breeze <mark3>blew</mark3>, the white foam <mark1>flew,</mark1><br>
The furrow followed <mark3>free;</mark3><br>
We were the first that ever <mark4>burst</mark4><br>
Into that silent <mark1>sea.</mark1><br>
<br>
Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt <mark4>down,</mark4><br>
'Twas sad as sad could <mark3>be;</mark3><br>
And we did speak only to <mark5>break</mark5><br>
The silence of the <mark1>sea!</mark1><br>
<br>
All in a hot and copper <mark3>sky,</mark3><br>
The bloody <mark4>Sun</mark4>, at <mark1>noon,</mark1><br>
Right up above the mast did <mark4>stand,</mark4><br>
No bigger than the <mark3>Moon.</mark3><br>
<br>
Day after <mark1>day</mark1>, day after <mark1>day,</mark1><br>
We stuck, nor breath nor <mark4>motion;</mark4><br>
As idle as a painted <mark4>ship</mark4><br>
Upon a painted <mark3>ocean.</mark3><br>
<br>
Water, water, every <mark3>where,</mark3><br>
And all the boards did <mark4>shrink;</mark4><br>
Water, water, every <mark1>where,</mark1><br>
Nor any drop to <mark3>drink.</mark3><br>
<br>
The very deep did rot: O <mark4>Christ!</mark4><br>
That ever this should <mark1>be!</mark1><br>
Yea, slimy things did crawl with <mark4>legs</mark4><br>
Upon the slimy <mark1>sea.</mark1><br>
<br>
About, <mark3>about</mark3>, in reel and <mark4>rout</mark4><br>
The death-fires danced at <mark4>night;</mark4><br>
The water, like a witch's <mark4>oils,</mark4><br>
Burnt green, and blue and <mark1>white.</mark1><br>
<br>
And some in dreams assured <mark3>were</mark3><br>
Of the Spirit that plagued us <mark3>so;</mark3><br>
Nine fathom deep he had followed <mark4>us</mark4><br>
From the land of mist and <mark1>snow.</mark1><br>
<br>
And every tongue, through utter <mark4>drought,</mark4><br>
Was withered at the <mark4>root;</mark4><br>
We could not speak, no more than <mark4>if</mark4><br>
We had been choked with <mark4>soot.</mark4><br>
<br>
Ah! well a-day! what evil <mark4>looks</mark4><br>
Had I from old and <mark4>young!</mark4><br>
Instead of the <mark4>cross</mark4>, the <mark1>Albatross</mark1><br>
About my neck was <mark3>hung.</mark3><br>
<br>
PART III <br>
There passed a weary time. Each <mark4>throat</mark4><br>
Was parched, and glazed each <mark1>eye.</mark1><br>
A weary time! a weary <mark4>time!</mark4><br>
How glazed each weary <mark1>eye,</mark1><br>
<br>
When looking <mark4>westward</mark4>, I <mark4>beheld</mark4><br>
A something in the <mark1>sky.</mark1><br>
<br>
At first it seemed a little <mark4>speck,</mark4><br>
And then it seemed a <mark1>mist;</mark1><br>
It moved and moved, and took at <mark4>last</mark4><br>
A certain shape, I <mark4>wist.</mark4><br>
<br>
A speck, a mist, a shape, I <mark1>wist!</mark1><br>
And still it neared and <mark4>neared:</mark4><br>
As if it dodged a <mark4>water-sprite,</mark4><br>
It plunged and tacked and <mark3>veered.</mark3><br>
<br>
With throats unslaked, with black lips <mark4>baked,</mark4><br>
We could nor laugh nor <mark4>wail;</mark4><br>
Through utter drought all dumb we <mark4>stood!</mark4><br>
I bit my arm, I sucked the <mark4>blood,</mark4><br>
And cried, A sail! a <mark3>sail!</mark3><br>
<br>
With throats unslaked, with black lips <mark1>baked,</mark1><br>
Agape they heard me <mark4>call:</mark4><br>
Gramercy! they for joy did <mark4>grin,</mark4><br>
And all at once their breath drew <mark3>in.</mark3><br>
As they were drinking <mark3>all.</mark3><br>
<br>
See! see! (I cried) she tacks no <mark4>more!</mark4><br>
Hither to work us <mark5>weal;</mark5><br>
Without a breeze, without a <mark4>tide,</mark4><br>
She steadies with upright <mark4>keel!</mark4><br>
<br>
The western wave was all <mark4>a-flame.</mark4><br>
The day was well nigh <mark4>done!</mark4><br>
Almost upon the western <mark4>wave</mark4><br>
Rested the broad bright <mark3>Sun;</mark3><br>
When that strange shape drove <mark4>suddenly</mark4><br>
Betwixt us and the <mark1>Sun.</mark1><br>
<br>
And straight the Sun was flecked with <mark4>bars,</mark4><br>
(Heaven's Mother send us <mark4>grace!)</mark4><br>
As if through a dungeon-grate he <mark4>peered</mark4><br>
With broad and burning <mark3>face.</mark3><br>
<br>
Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat <mark4>loud)</mark4><br>
How fast she nears and <mark4>nears!</mark4><br>
Are those  her sails that glance in the <mark1>Sun,</mark1><br>
Like restless gossameres? <br>
<br>
Are those her  ribs through which the <mark1>Sun</mark1><br>
Did peer, as through a <mark4>grate?</mark4><br>
And is that Woman all her <mark3>crew?</mark3><br>
Is that a DEATH? and are there <mark3>two?</mark3><br>
Is DEATH that woman's <mark3>mate?</mark3><br>
<br>
Her lips were red,  her looks were <mark1>free,</mark1><br>
Her locks were yellow as <mark4>gold:</mark4><br>
Her skin was as white as <mark4>leprosy,</mark4><br>
The Night-mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was <mark1>she,</mark1><br>
Who thicks man's blood with <mark1>cold.</mark1><br>
<br>
The naked hulk alongside <mark1>came,</mark1><br>
And the twain were casting <mark4>dice;</mark4><br>
'The game is done! I've won! I've <mark3>won!'</mark3><br>
Quoth she, and whistles <mark3>thrice.</mark3><br>
<br>
The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush <mark4>out;</mark4><br>
At one stride comes the <mark4>dark;</mark4><br>
With far-heard whisper, o'er the <mark1>sea,</mark1><br>
Off shot the <mark3>spectre-bark.</mark3><br>
<br>
We listened and looked sideways <mark4>up!</mark4><br>
Fear at my heart, as at a <mark3>cup,</mark3><br>
My life-blood seemed to <mark4>sip!</mark4><br>
The stars were dim, and thick the <mark1>night,</mark1><br>
The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed <mark1>white;</mark1><br>
From the sails the dew did <mark3>drip--</mark3><br>
Till clomb above the eastern <mark4>bar</mark4><br>
The horned Moon, with one bright <mark3>star</mark3><br>
Within the nether <mark3>tip.</mark3><br>
<br>
One after <mark4>one</mark4>, by the star-dogged <mark1>Moon,</mark1><br>
Too quick for groan or <mark3>sigh,</mark3><br>
Each turned his face with a ghastly <mark4>pang,</mark4><br>
And cursed me with his <mark1>eye.</mark1><br>
<br>
Four times fifty living <mark4>men,</mark4><br>
(And I heard nor sigh nor <mark4>groan)</mark4><br>
With heavy <mark3>thump</mark3>, a lifeless <mark4>lump,</mark4><br>
They dropped down one by <mark4>one.</mark4><br>
<br>
The souls did from their bodies <mark3>fly,--</mark3><br>
They fled to bliss or <mark1>woe!</mark1><br>
And every soul, it passed me <mark1>by,</mark1><br>
Like the whizz of my <mark1>cross-bow!</mark1><br>
<br>
PART IV <br>
'I fear thee, ancient <mark1>Mariner!</mark1><br>
I fear thy skinny <mark1>hand!</mark1><br>
And thou art long, and lank, and <mark4>brown,</mark4><br>
As is the ribbed <mark3>sea-sand.</mark3><br>
<br>
I fear thee and thy glittering <mark1>eye,</mark1><br>
And thy skinny hand, so <mark1>brown.'--</mark1><br>
Fear <mark4>not</mark4>, fear not, thou <mark4>Wedding-Guest!</mark4><br>
This body dropt not <mark1>down.</mark1><br>
<br>
Alone, alone, all, all <mark4>alone,</mark4><br>
Alone on a wide wide <mark1>sea!</mark1><br>
And never a saint took pity <mark4>on</mark4><br>
My soul in <mark4>agony.</mark4><br>
<br>
The many men, so <mark4>beautiful!</mark4><br>
And they all dead did <mark3>lie:</mark3><br>
And a thousand thousand slimy <mark4>things</mark4><br>
Lived on; and so did <mark1>I.</mark1><br>
<br>
I looked upon the rotting <mark1>sea,</mark1><br>
And drew my eyes <mark3>away;</mark3><br>
I looked upon the rotting <mark4>deck,</mark4><br>
And there the dead men <mark3>lay.</mark3><br>
<br>
I looked to heaven, and tried to <mark3>pray;</mark3><br>
But or ever a prayer had gusht, <br>
A wicked whisper came, and <mark4>made</mark4><br>
My heart as dry as <mark4>dust.</mark4><br>
<br>
I closed my <mark4>lids</mark4>, and kept them <mark4>close,</mark4><br>
And the balls like pulses <mark4>beat;</mark4><br>
For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the <mark1>sky</mark1><br>
Lay dead like a load on my weary <mark1>eye,</mark1><br>
And the dead were at my <mark3>feet.</mark3><br>
<br>
The cold sweat melted from their <mark4>limbs,</mark4><br>
Nor rot nor reek did <mark3>they:</mark3><br>
The look with which they looked on <mark1>me</mark1><br>
Had never passed <mark1>away.</mark1><br>
<br>
An orphan's curse would drag to <mark4>hell</mark4><br>
A spirit from on <mark3>high;</mark3><br>
But oh! more horrible than <mark4>that</mark4><br>
Is the curse in a dead man's <mark1>eye!</mark1><br>
Seven days, seven <mark4>nights</mark4>, I saw that <mark4>curse,</mark4><br>
And yet I could not <mark3>die.</mark3><br>
<br>
The moving Moon went up the <mark1>sky,</mark1><br>
And no where did <mark4>abide:</mark4><br>
Softly she was going <mark1>up,</mark1><br>
And a star or two <mark3>beside--</mark3><br>
<br>
Her beams bemocked the sultry <mark4>main,</mark4><br>
Like April hoar-frost <mark4>spread;</mark4><br>
But where the ship's huge shadow <mark1>lay,</mark1><br>
The charmed water burnt <mark1>alway</mark1><br>
A still and awful <mark3>red.</mark3><br>
<br>
Beyond the shadow of the <mark1>ship,</mark1><br>
I watched the <mark4>water-snakes:</mark4><br>
They moved in tracks of shining <mark1>white,</mark1><br>
And when they reared, the elfish <mark3>light</mark3><br>
Fell off in hoary <mark3>flakes.</mark3><br>
<br>
Within the shadow of the <mark1>ship</mark1><br>
I watched their rich <mark4>attire:</mark4><br>
Blue, glossy green, and velvet <mark4>black,</mark4><br>
They coiled and swam; and every <mark3>track</mark3><br>
Was a flash of golden <mark3>fire.</mark3><br>
<br>
O happy living things! no <mark4>tongue</mark4><br>
Their beauty might <mark4>declare:</mark4><br>
A spring of love gushed from my <mark4>heart,</mark4><br>
And I blessed them <mark3>unaware:</mark3><br>
Sure my kind saint took pity on <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
And I blessed them <mark1>unaware.</mark1><br>
<br>
The self-same moment I could <mark1>pray;</mark1><br>
And from my neck so <mark1>free</mark1><br>
The Albatross fell off, and <mark4>sank</mark4><br>
Like lead into the <mark1>sea.</mark1><br>
<br>
PART <mark3>V</mark3><br>
Oh sleep! it is a gentle <mark1>thing,</mark1><br>
Beloved from pole to <mark4>pole!</mark4><br>
To Mary Queen the praise be <mark4>given!</mark4><br>
She sent the gentle sleep from <mark4>Heaven,</mark4><br>
That slid into my <mark1>soul.</mark1><br>
<br>
The silly buckets on the <mark1>deck,</mark1><br>
That had so long <mark4>remained,</mark4><br>
I dreamt that they were filled with <mark3>dew;</mark3><br>
And when I awoke, it <mark3>rained.</mark3><br>
<br>
My lips were wet, my throat was <mark1>cold,</mark1><br>
My garments all were <mark4>dank;</mark4><br>
Sure I had drunken in my <mark4>dreams,</mark4><br>
And still my body <mark3>drank.</mark3><br>
<br>
I moved, and could not feel my <mark1>limbs:</mark1><br>
I was so <mark5>light--almost</mark5><br>
I thought that I had died in <mark4>sleep,</mark4><br>
And was a blessed <mark4>ghost.</mark4><br>
<br>
And soon I heard a roaring <mark4>wind:</mark4><br>
It did not come anear; <br>
But with its sound it shook the <mark4>sails,</mark4><br>
That were so thin and <mark4>sere.</mark4><br>
<br>
The upper air burst into <mark4>life!</mark4><br>
And a hundred fire-flags <mark1>sheen,</mark1><br>
To and fro they were hurried <mark4>about!</mark4><br>
And to and fro, and in and <mark1>out,</mark1><br>
The wan stars danced <mark1>between.</mark1><br>
<br>
And the coming wind did roar more <mark1>loud,</mark1><br>
And the sails did sigh like <mark3>sedge,</mark3><br>
And the rain poured down from one black <mark3>cloud;</mark3><br>
The Moon was at its <mark3>edge.</mark3><br>
<br>
The thick black cloud was cleft, and <mark1>still</mark1><br>
The Moon was at its <mark4>side:</mark4><br>
Like waters shot from some high crag, <br>
The lightning fell with never a jag, <br>
A river steep and <mark1>wide.</mark1><br>
<br>
The loud wind never reached the <mark1>ship,</mark1><br>
Yet now the ship moved <mark1>on!</mark1><br>
Beneath the lightning and the <mark1>Moon</mark1><br>
The dead men gave a <mark1>groan.</mark1><br>
<br>
They groaned, they stirred, they all <mark5>uprose,</mark5><br>
Nor spake, nor moved their <mark4>eyes;</mark4><br>
It had been strange, even in a <mark4>dream,</mark4><br>
To have seen those dead men <mark3>rise.</mark3><br>
<br>
The helmsman steered, the ship moved <mark1>on;</mark1><br>
Yet never a breeze <mark3>up-blew;</mark3><br>
The mariners all 'gan work the <mark4>ropes,</mark4><br>
Where they were wont to <mark3>do;</mark3><br>
They raised their limbs like lifeless <mark4>tools--</mark4><br>
We were a ghastly <mark1>crew.</mark1><br>
<br>
The body of my brother's <mark4>son</mark4><br>
Stood by <mark3>me</mark3>, knee to <mark3>knee:</mark3><br>
The body and I pulled at one <mark4>rope,</mark4><br>
But he said nought to <mark1>me.</mark1><br>
<br>
'I fear thee, ancient <mark1>Mariner!'</mark1><br>
Be calm, thou <mark1>Wedding-Guest!</mark1><br>
'Twas not those souls that fled in <mark4>pain,</mark4><br>
Which to their corses came <mark3>again,</mark3><br>
But a troop of spirits <mark3>blest:</mark3><br>
<br>
For when it dawned--they dropped their <mark4>arms,</mark4><br>
And clustered round the <mark4>mast;</mark4><br>
Sweet sounds rose slowly through their <mark4>mouths,</mark4><br>
And from their bodies <mark3>passed.</mark3><br>
<br>
Around, <mark3>around</mark3>, flew each sweet <mark4>sound,</mark4><br>
Then darted to the <mark1>Sun;</mark1><br>
Slowly the sounds came back <mark1>again,</mark1><br>
Now mixed, now one by <mark1>one.</mark1><br>
<br>
Sometimes a-dropping from the <mark1>sky</mark1><br>
I heard the sky-lark <mark3>sing;</mark3><br>
Sometimes all little birds that <mark3>are,</mark3><br>
How they seemed to fill the sea and <mark4>air</mark4><br>
With their sweet jargoning! <br>
<br>
And now 'twas like all <mark4>instruments,</mark4><br>
Now like a lonely <mark4>flute;</mark4><br>
And now it is an angel's <mark4>song,</mark4><br>
That makes the heavens be <mark3>mute.</mark3><br>
<br>
It ceased; yet still the sails made <mark1>on</mark1><br>
A pleasant noise till <mark1>noon,</mark1><br>
A noise like of a hidden <mark4>brook</mark4><br>
In the leafy month of <mark3>June,</mark3><br>
That to the sleeping woods all <mark1>night</mark1><br>
Singeth a quiet <mark3>tune.</mark3><br>
<br>
Till noon we quietly sailed <mark1>on,</mark1><br>
Yet never a breeze did <mark5>breathe:</mark5><br>
Slowly and smoothly went the <mark1>ship,</mark1><br>
Moved onward from <mark4>beneath.</mark4><br>
<br>
Under the keel nine fathom <mark4>deep,</mark4><br>
From the land of mist and <mark1>snow,</mark1><br>
The spirit slid: and it was <mark1>he</mark1><br>
That made the ship to <mark3>go.</mark3><br>
The sails at noon left off their <mark1>tune,</mark1><br>
And the ship stood still <mark4>also.</mark4><br>
<br>
The Sun, right up above the <mark1>mast,</mark1><br>
Had fixed her to the <mark1>ocean:</mark1><br>
But in a minute she 'gan <mark3>stir,</mark3><br>
With a short uneasy <mark1>motion--</mark1><br>
Backwards and forwards half her <mark4>length</mark4><br>
With a short uneasy <mark1>motion.</mark1><br>
<br>
Then like a pawing horse let <mark1>go,</mark1><br>
She made a sudden <mark3>bound:</mark3><br>
It flung the blood into my <mark1>head,</mark1><br>
And I fell down in a <mark1>swound.</mark1><br>
<br>
How long in that same fit I <mark1>lay,</mark1><br>
I have not to <mark1>declare;</mark1><br>
But ere my living life <mark4>returned,</mark4><br>
I heard and in my soul <mark3>discerned</mark3><br>
Two voices in the <mark1>air.</mark1><br>
<br>
'Is it he?' quoth <mark4>one</mark4>, 'Is this the <mark1>man?</mark1><br>
By him who died on <mark4>cross,</mark4><br>
With his cruel bow he laid full <mark3>low</mark3><br>
The harmless <mark1>Albatross.</mark1><br>
<br>
The spirit who bideth by <mark4>himself</mark4><br>
In the land of mist and <mark1>snow,</mark1><br>
He loved the bird that loved the <mark1>man</mark1><br>
Who shot him with his <mark3>bow.'</mark3><br>
<br>
The other was a softer <mark4>voice,</mark4><br>
As soft as honey-dew: <br>
Quoth he, 'The man hath penance <mark1>done,</mark1><br>
And penance more will <mark1>do.'</mark1><br>
<br>
PART <mark3>VI</mark3><br>
<br>
First <mark1>Voice</mark1><br>
'But tell me, tell me! speak <mark1>again,</mark1><br>
Thy soft response <mark4>renewing--</mark4><br>
What makes that ship drive on so <mark3>fast?</mark3><br>
What is the ocean <mark3>doing?'</mark3><br>
<br>
Second <mark1>Voice</mark1><br>
Still as a slave before his <mark4>lord,</mark4><br>
The ocean hath no <mark1>blast;</mark1><br>
His great bright eye most <mark4>silently</mark4><br>
Up to the Moon is <mark3>cast--</mark3><br>
<br>
If he may know which way to <mark1>go;</mark1><br>
For she guides him smooth or <mark4>grim.</mark4><br>
See, brother, see! how <mark4>graciously</mark4><br>
She looketh down on <mark3>him.'</mark3><br>
<br>
First <mark1>Voice</mark1><br>
'But why drives on that ship so <mark1>fast,</mark1><br>
Without or wave or <mark1>wind?'</mark1><br>
<br>
Second <mark1>Voice</mark1><br>
'The air is cut away <mark4>before,</mark4><br>
And closes from <mark1>behind.</mark1><br>
<br>
Fly, brother, fly! more <mark1>high</mark1>, more <mark1>high!</mark1><br>
Or we shall be <mark4>belated:</mark4><br>
For slow and slow that ship will <mark1>go,</mark1><br>
When the Mariner's trance is <mark3>abated.'</mark3><br>
<br>
I woke, and we were sailing <mark1>on</mark1><br>
As in a gentle <mark3>weather:</mark3><br>
'Twas night, calm night, the moon was <mark1>high;</mark1><br>
The dead men stood <mark3>together.</mark3><br>
<br>
All stood together on the <mark1>deck,</mark1><br>
For a charnel-dungeon <mark4>fitter:</mark4><br>
All fixed on me their stony <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
That in the Moon did <mark3>glitter.</mark3><br>
<br>
The pang, the curse, with which they <mark4>died,</mark4><br>
Had never passed <mark1>away:</mark1><br>
I could not draw my eyes from <mark4>theirs,</mark4><br>
Nor turn them up to <mark1>pray.</mark1><br>
<br>
And now this spell was snapt: once <mark1>more</mark1><br>
I viewed the ocean <mark4>green,</mark4><br>
And looked far forth, yet little saw <br>
Of what had else been <mark3>seen--</mark3><br>
<br>
Like one, that on a lonesome <mark4>road</mark4><br>
Doth walk in fear and <mark4>dread,</mark4><br>
And having once turned round walks <mark1>on,</mark1><br>
And turns no more his <mark1>head;</mark1><br>
Because he knows, a frightful <mark4>fiend</mark4><br>
Doth close behind him <mark4>tread.</mark4><br>
<br>
But soon there breathed a wind on <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
Nor sound nor motion <mark1>made:</mark1><br>
Its path was not upon the <mark1>sea,</mark1><br>
In ripple or in <mark3>shade.</mark3><br>
<br>
It raised my hair, it fanned my <mark4>cheek</mark4><br>
Like a meadow-gale of <mark4>spring--</mark4><br>
It mingled strangely with my <mark4>fears,</mark4><br>
Yet it felt like a <mark4>welcoming.</mark4><br>
<br>
Swiftly, swiftly flew the <mark1>ship,</mark1><br>
Yet she sailed softly <mark3>too:</mark3><br>
Sweetly, sweetly blew the <mark4>breeze--</mark4><br>
On me alone it <mark3>blew.</mark3><br>
<br>
Oh! dream of joy! is this <mark4>indeed</mark4><br>
The light-house top I <mark2>see?</mark2><br>
Is this the hill? is this the <mark4>kirk?</mark4><br>
Is this mine own <mark1>countree?</mark1><br>
<br>
We drifted o'er the <mark4>harbour-bar,</mark4><br>
And I with sobs did <mark1>pray--</mark1><br>
O let me be awake, my <mark4>God!</mark4><br>
Or let me sleep <mark1>alway.</mark1><br>
<br>
The harbour-bay was clear as <mark4>glass,</mark4><br>
So smoothly it was <mark4>strewn!</mark4><br>
And on the bay the moonlight <mark1>lay,</mark1><br>
And the shadow of the <mark1>Moon.</mark1><br>
<br>
The rock shone bright, the kirk no <mark4>less,</mark4><br>
That stands above the <mark4>rock:</mark4><br>
The moonlight steeped in <mark5>silentness</mark5><br>
The steady <mark5>weathercock.</mark5><br>
<br>
And the bay was white with silent <mark1>light,</mark1><br>
Till rising from the <mark4>same,</mark4><br>
Full many shapes, that shadows <mark1>were,</mark1><br>
In crimson colours <mark1>came.</mark1><br>
<br>
A little distance from the <mark1>prow</mark1><br>
Those crimson shadows <mark1>were:</mark1><br>
I turned my eyes upon the <mark1>deck--</mark1><br>
Oh, Christ! what saw I <mark1>there!</mark1><br>
<br>
Each corse lay <mark1>flat</mark1>, lifeless and <mark4>flat,</mark4><br>
<mark4>And</mark4>, by the holy <mark4>rood!</mark4><br>
A man all light, a <mark4>seraph-man,</mark4><br>
On every corse there <mark1>stood.</mark1><br>
<br>
This <mark3>seraph-band</mark3>, each waved his <mark1>hand:</mark1><br>
It was a heavenly <mark4>sight!</mark4><br>
They stood as signals to the <mark3>land,</mark3><br>
Each one a lovely <mark1>light;</mark1><br>
<br>
This <mark3>seraph-band</mark3>, each waved his <mark1>hand,</mark1><br>
No voice did they <mark4>impart--</mark4><br>
No voice; but oh! the silence <mark1>sank</mark1><br>
Like music on my <mark1>heart.</mark1><br>
<br>
But soon I heard the dash of <mark4>oars,</mark4><br>
I heard the Pilot's <mark4>cheer;</mark4><br>
My head was turned perforce <mark1>away</mark1><br>
And I saw a boat <mark3>appear.</mark3><br>
<br>
The Pilot and the Pilot's <mark3>boy,</mark3><br>
I heard them coming <mark1>fast:</mark1><br>
Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a <mark3>joy</mark3><br>
The dead men could not <mark1>blast.</mark1><br>
<br>
I saw a third--I heard his <mark1>voice:</mark1><br>
It is the Hermit <mark4>good!</mark4><br>
He singeth loud his godly <mark4>hymns</mark4><br>
That he makes in the <mark3>wood.</mark3><br>
He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash <mark1>away</mark1><br>
The Albatross's <mark1>blood.</mark1><br>
<br>
PART VII <br>
This Hermit good lives in that <mark1>wood</mark1><br>
Which slopes down to the <mark1>sea.</mark1><br>
How loudly his sweet voice he <mark4>rears!</mark4><br>
He loves to talk with <mark5>marineres</mark5><br>
That come from a far <mark1>countree.</mark1><br>
<br>
He kneels at morn, and noon, and <mark4>eve--</mark4><br>
He hath a cushion <mark4>plump:</mark4><br>
It is the moss that wholly <mark4>hides</mark4><br>
The rotted old <mark3>oak-stump.</mark3><br>
<br>
The skiff-boat neared: I heard them <mark4>talk,</mark4><br>
'Why, this is strange, I <mark3>trow!</mark3><br>
Where are those lights so many and <mark4>fair,</mark4><br>
That signal made but <mark3>now?'</mark3><br>
<br>
'Strange, by my faith!' the Hermit <mark4>said--</mark4><br>
'And they answered not our <mark1>cheer!</mark1><br>
The planks looked warped! and see those <mark1>sails,</mark1><br>
How thin they are and <mark1>sere!</mark1><br>
I never saw aught like to <mark4>them,</mark4><br>
Unless perchance it <mark1>were</mark1><br>
<br>
Brown skeletons of leaves that lag <br>
My forest-brook <mark1>along;</mark1><br>
When the ivy-tod is heavy with <mark1>snow,</mark1><br>
And the owlet whoops to the wolf <mark3>below,</mark3><br>
That eats the she-wolf's <mark1>young.'</mark1><br>
<br>
'Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish <mark4>look--</mark4><br>
(The Pilot made <mark3>reply)</mark3><br>
I am a-feared'--'Push <mark1>on</mark1>, push <mark1>on!'</mark1><br>
Said the Hermit <mark5>cheerily.</mark5><br>
<br>
The boat came closer to the <mark1>ship,</mark1><br>
But I nor spake nor <mark4>stirred;</mark4><br>
The boat came close beneath the <mark1>ship,</mark1><br>
And straight a sound was <mark3>heard.</mark3><br>
<br>
Under the water it rumbled <mark1>on,</mark1><br>
Still louder and more <mark1>dread:</mark1><br>
It reached the ship, it split the <mark3>bay;</mark3><br>
The ship went down like <mark3>lead.</mark3><br>
<br>
Stunned by that loud and dreadful <mark1>sound,</mark1><br>
Which sky and ocean smote, <br>
Like one that hath been seven days <mark3>drowned</mark3><br>
My body lay <mark4>afloat;</mark4><br>
But swift as dreams, myself I <mark3>found</mark3><br>
Within the Pilot's <mark3>boat.</mark3><br>
<br>
Upon the whirl, where sank the <mark1>ship,</mark1><br>
The boat spun round and <mark3>round;</mark3><br>
And all was <mark3>still</mark3>, save that the <mark1>hill</mark1><br>
Was telling of the <mark1>sound.</mark1><br>
<br>
I moved my lips--the Pilot <mark4>shrieked</mark4><br>
And fell down in a <mark4>fit;</mark4><br>
The holy Hermit raised his <mark1>eyes,</mark1><br>
And prayed where he did <mark3>sit.</mark3><br>
<br>
I took the oars: the Pilot's <mark1>boy,</mark1><br>
Who now doth crazy <mark1>go,</mark1><br>
Laughed loud and long, and all the <mark4>while</mark4><br>
His eyes went to and <mark3>fro.</mark3><br>
'Ha! ha!' quoth <mark3>he</mark3>, 'full plain I <mark1>see,</mark1><br>
The Devil knows how to <mark3>row.'</mark3><br>
<br>
And now, all in my own <mark1>countree,</mark1><br>
I stood on the firm <mark1>land!</mark1><br>
The Hermit stepped forth from the <mark1>boat,</mark1><br>
And scarcely he could <mark1>stand.</mark1><br>
<br>
'O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy <mark1>man!'</mark1><br>
The Hermit crossed his <mark3>brow.</mark3><br>
'Say quick,' quoth he, 'I bid thee <mark3>say--</mark3><br>
What manner of man art <mark3>thou?'</mark3><br>
<br>
Forthwith this frame of mine was <mark4>wrenched</mark4><br>
With a woful <mark1>agony,</mark1><br>
Which forced me to begin my <mark4>tale;</mark4><br>
And then it left me <mark1>free.</mark1><br>
<br>
Since then, at an uncertain <mark4>hour,</mark4><br>
That agony <mark4>returns:</mark4><br>
And till my ghastly tale is <mark4>told,</mark4><br>
This heart within me <mark3>burns.</mark3><br>
I pass, like night, from land to <mark1>land;</mark1><br>
<br>
I have strange power of <mark5>speech;</mark5><br>
That moment that his face I <mark1>see,</mark1><br>
I know the man that must hear <mark1>me:</mark1><br>
To him my tale I <mark3>teach.</mark3><br>
What loud uproar bursts from that <mark4>door!</mark4><br>
<br>
The wedding-guests are <mark1>there:</mark1><br>
But in the garden-bower the <mark4>bride</mark4><br>
And bride-maids singing <mark1>are:</mark1><br>
And hark the little vesper <mark4>bell,</mark4><br>
Which biddeth me to <mark4>prayer!</mark4><br>
O Wedding-Guest! this soul hath <mark4>been</mark4><br>
<br>
Alone on a wide wide <mark1>sea:</mark1><br>
So lonely 'twas, that God <mark1>himself</mark1><br>
Scarce seemed there to <mark1>be.</mark1><br>
O sweeter than the <mark4>marriage-feast,</mark4><br>
<br>
'Tis sweeter far to <mark1>me,</mark1><br>
To walk together to the <mark1>kirk</mark1><br>
With a goodly company!-- <br>
To walk together to the <mark1>kirk,</mark1><br>
<br>
And all together <mark1>pray,</mark1><br>
While each to his great Father <mark4>bends,</mark4><br>
Old men, and <mark4>babes</mark4>, and loving <mark3>friends</mark3><br>
And youths and maidens <mark3>gay!</mark3><br>
<mark3>Farewell</mark3>, farewell! but this I <mark3>tell</mark3><br>
<br>
To thee, thou <mark1>Wedding-Guest!</mark1><br>
He prayeth <mark1>well</mark1>, who loveth <mark3>well</mark3><br>
Both man and bird and <mark4>beast.</mark4><br>
He prayeth <mark1>best</mark1>, who loveth <mark4>best</mark4><br>
<br>
All things both great and <mark4>small;</mark4><br>
For the dear God who loveth <mark1>us,</mark1><br>
He made and loveth <mark1>all.</mark1><br>
The Mariner, whose eye is <mark4>bright,</mark4><br>
<br>
Whose beard with age is <mark4>hoar,</mark4><br>
Is gone: and now the <mark1>Wedding-Guest</mark1><br>
Turned from the bridegroom's <mark1>door.</mark1><br>
He went like one that hath been <mark4>stunned,</mark4><br>
<br>
And is of sense <mark4>forlorn:</mark4><br>
A sadder and a wiser <mark1>man,</mark1><br>
He rose the morrow <mark4>morn.</mark4><br>
