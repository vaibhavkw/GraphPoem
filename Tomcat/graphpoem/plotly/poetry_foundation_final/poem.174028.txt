Title : Town Eclogues: Monday; Roxana or the Drawing-Room <br>
Author : Lady Mary Wortley Montagu <br><br>

ROXANA from the court retiring <mark3>late,</mark3><br>
Sigh'd her soft sorrows at St. JAMES's <mark3>gate:</mark3><br>
Such heavy thoughts lay brooding in her <mark4>breast,</mark4><br>
Not her own chairmen wth more weight opprest;<br>
They groan the cruel load they're doom'd to bear <mark3>;</mark3><br>
She in these gentler sounds express'd her <mark3>care.</mark3><br>
<br>
" Was it for this, that I these Roses <mark3>wear,</mark3><br>
" For this new-set my Jewels for my hair <mark3>?</mark3><br>
" Ah ! Princess ! with what zeal have I pursu'd <mark5>!</mark5><br>
" Almost forgot the duty of a <mark4>Prude.</mark4><br>
" Thinking I never cou'd attend too <mark3>soon,</mark3><br>
" I've miss'd my prayers, to get me dress'd by <mark3>noon.</mark3><br>
" For Thee, ah ! what for Thee did I resign <mark4>?</mark4><br>
" My Pleasures, Passions, all that e'er was <mark3>mine.</mark3><br>
" I sacrific'd both Modesty and <mark4>Ease,</mark4><br>
" <mark4>Lef</mark4>, Operas, and went to filthy Plays <mark4>;</mark4><br>
" Double entendres shock'd my tender <mark4>ear,</mark4><br>
" Yet even this for Thee I chose to <mark1>bear.</mark1><br>
" In glowing youth, when nature bids be <mark3>gay,</mark3><br>
" And ev'ry joy of life before me <mark3>lay,</mark3><br>
" By honour prompted, and by pride <mark4>restrain'd,</mark4><br>
" The pleasures of the young my soul disdain'd <mark3>:</mark3><br>
" Sermons I sought, and with a mien <mark4>severe</mark4><br>
" Censur'd <mark4>m</mark4>, neighbours, and said daily <mark4>pray'r.</mark4><br>
" Alas ! how chang'd! ? with the same sermon <mark4>mien</mark4><br>
" That once I pray'd, the What-d'ye call't I've <mark3>seen.</mark3><br>
" Ah ! cruel Princess, for thy sake I've <mark4>lost</mark4><br>
" That reputation which so dear had cost <mark3>:</mark3><br>
" I, who avoided ev'ry publick <mark3>place,</mark3><br>
" When bloom, and beauty bid me show my face <mark3>;</mark3><br>
" Now near Thee constant ev'ry night <mark4>abide</mark4><br>
" With never-failing duty by thy <mark3>side,</mark3><br>
" Myself and daughters standing on a <mark3>row,</mark3><br>
" To all the foreigners a goodly show <mark3>!</mark3><br>
" Oft had your drawing-room been sadly <mark4>thin,</mark4><br>
" And merchants wives close by the chair had been seen <mark1>;</mark1><br>
" Had not I amply fill'd the empty <mark3>space,</mark3><br>
" And sav'd your Highness from the dire <mark3>disgrace.</mark3><br>
<br>
" Yet COQUETILLA's artifice <mark4>prevails,</mark4><br>
" When all my merit and my duty fails <mark3>:</mark3><br>
" That COQUETILLA, whose deluding <mark4>airs</mark4><br>
" Corrupts <mark4>ou</mark4>, virgins, and our youth ensnares <mark3>;</mark3><br>
" So sunk her character, so lost her <mark3>fame,</mark3><br>
" Scarce visited before your Highness came <mark3>;</mark3><br>
" Yet for the Bed-chamber 'tis Her you <mark4>chuse,</mark4><br>
" When Zeal and Fame and Virtue you <mark3>refuse.</mark3><br>
" Ah ! worthy choice ! not one of all your <mark4>train</mark4><br>
" Whom censure blasts not, and dishonours <mark3>stain.</mark3><br>
" Let the nice hind now suckle dirty <mark4>pigs,</mark4><br>
" And the proud pea-hen snatch the cuckoo's eggs <mark4>!</mark4><br>
" Let IRIS leave her paint, and own her <mark3>age,</mark3><br>
" And grave SUFFOLKIA wed a giddy page <mark3>!</mark3><br>
" A greater miracle is daily <mark4>view'd,</mark4><br>
" A virtuous Princess with a court so <mark4>lewd.</mark4><br>
<br>
" I know thee, Court ! with all thy treach'rous <mark4>wiles,</mark4><br>
" Thy false caresses and undoing smiles <mark3>!</mark3><br>
" <mark4>Ah</mark4>, Princess, learn'd in all the courtly <mark4>arts</mark4><br>
" To cheat <mark4>ou</mark4>, hopes, and yet to gain our <mark3>hearts.</mark3><br>
<br>
" Large lovely bribes are the great statesman's aim <mark3>;</mark3><br>
" And the neglected patriot follows <mark1>fame.</mark1><br>
" The Prince is ogled ; some the King pursue <mark5>;</mark5><br>
" But your ROXANA only follows <mark3>YOU.</mark3><br>
" Despis'd ROXANA, cease, and try to <mark4>find</mark4><br>
" Some other, since the Princess proves unkind <mark3>:</mark3><br>
" Perhaps it is not hard to find at <mark4>court</mark4><br>
" If not a greater, a more firm <mark3>support.</mark3><br>
