Title : Rhapsody on a Windy Night <br>
Author : T. S. Eliot <br><br>

Twelve <mark4>o'clock.</mark4><br>
Along the reaches of the <mark4>street</mark4><br>
Held in a lunar <mark4>synthesis,</mark4><br>
Whispering lunar incantations <br>
Dissolve the floors of <mark1>memory</mark1><br>
And all its clear <mark4>relations,</mark4><br>
Its divisions and precisions, <br>
Every street lamp that I <mark4>pass</mark4><br>
Beats like a fatalistic <mark4>drum,</mark4><br>
And through the spaces of the <mark4>dark</mark4><br>
Midnight shakes the <mark1>memory</mark1><br>
As a madman shakes a dead <mark4>geranium.</mark4><br>
<br>
Half-past <mark4>one,</mark4><br>
The street lamp <mark3>sputtered,</mark3><br>
The street lamp <mark3>muttered,</mark3><br>
The street lamp said, "Regard that <mark4>woman</mark4><br>
Who hesitates towards you in the light of the <mark1>door</mark1><br>
Which opens on her like a <mark4>grin.</mark4><br>
You see the border of her <mark4>dress</mark4><br>
Is torn and stained with <mark4>sand,</mark4><br>
And you see the corner of her <mark3>eye</mark3><br>
Twists like a crooked <mark3>pin."</mark3><br>
<br>
The memory throws up high and <mark3>dry</mark3><br>
A crowd of twisted <mark4>things;</mark4><br>
A twisted branch upon the beach <br>
Eaten smooth, and <mark4>polished</mark4><br>
As if the world gave <mark4>up</mark4><br>
The secret of its <mark4>skeleton,</mark4><br>
Stiff and <mark4>white.</mark4><br>
A broken spring in a factory <mark4>yard,</mark4><br>
Rust that clings to the form that the strength has <mark4>left</mark4><br>
Hard and curled and ready to <mark4>snap.</mark4><br>
<br>
Half-past two, <br>
The street lamp <mark4>said,</mark4><br>
"Remark the cat which flattens itself in the <mark3>gutter,</mark3><br>
Slips out its tongue <br>
And devours a morsel of rancid <mark3>butter."</mark3><br>
So the hand of a child, <mark4>automatic,</mark4><br>
Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the <mark3>quay.</mark3><br>
I could see nothing behind that child's <mark1>eye.</mark1><br>
I have seen eyes in the <mark1>street</mark1><br>
Trying to peer through lighted <mark4>shutters,</mark4><br>
And a crab one afternoon in a <mark4>pool,</mark4><br>
An old crab with barnacles on his <mark4>back,</mark4><br>
Gripped the end of a stick which I held <mark4>him.</mark4><br>
<br>
Half-past <mark3>three,</mark3><br>
The lamp <mark1>sputtered,</mark1><br>
The lamp muttered in the <mark1>dark.</mark1><br>
<br>
The lamp hummed: <br>
"Regard the <mark4>moon,</mark4><br>
La lune ne garde aucune rancune, <br>
She winks a feeble <mark1>eye,</mark1><br>
She smiles into <mark4>corners.</mark4><br>
She smoothes the hair of the <mark4>grass.</mark4><br>
The moon has lost her <mark1>memory.</mark1><br>
A washed-out smallpox cracks her <mark4>face,</mark4><br>
Her hand twists a paper <mark4>rose,</mark4><br>
That smells of dust and old <mark4>Cologne,</mark4><br>
She is <mark3>alone</mark3><br>
With all the old nocturnal <mark4>smells</mark4><br>
That cross and cross across her <mark4>brain."</mark4><br>
The reminiscence <mark4>comes</mark4><br>
Of sunless dry <mark4>geraniums</mark4><br>
And dust in <mark4>crevices,</mark4><br>
Smells of chestnuts in the <mark4>streets,</mark4><br>
And female smells in shuttered <mark4>rooms,</mark4><br>
And cigarettes in <mark4>corridors</mark4><br>
And cocktail smells in <mark4>bars."</mark4><br>
<br>
The lamp <mark1>said,</mark1><br>
"Four <mark1>o'clock,</mark1><br>
Here is the number on the <mark1>door.</mark1><br>
<br>
You have the <mark3>key,</mark3><br>
The little lamp spreads a ring on the <mark4>stair,</mark4><br>
<br>
The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the <mark4>wall,</mark4><br>
Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for <mark3>life."</mark3><br>
<br>
The last twist of the <mark3>knife.</mark3><br>
