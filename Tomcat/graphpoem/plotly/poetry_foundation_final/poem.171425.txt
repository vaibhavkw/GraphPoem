Title : The Heaven of Animals <br>
Author : James L. Dickey <br><br>

Here they are. The soft eyes <mark1>open.</mark1><br>
If they have lived in a <mark1>wood</mark1><br>
It is a <mark1>wood.</mark1><br>
If they have lived on <mark4>plains</mark4><br>
It is grass <mark4>rolling</mark4><br>
Under their feet <mark4>forever.</mark4><br>
<br>
Having no souls, they have <mark4>come,</mark4><br>
Anyway, beyond their <mark4>knowing.</mark4><br>
Their instincts wholly <mark4>bloom</mark4><br>
And they <mark4>rise.</mark4><br>
The soft eyes <mark1>open.</mark1><br>
<br>
To match them, the landscape <mark4>flowers,</mark4><br>
Outdoing, <mark4>desperately</mark4><br>
Outdoing what is <mark4>required:</mark4><br>
The richest <mark1>wood,</mark1><br>
The deepest <mark4>field.</mark4><br>
<br>
For some of <mark4>these,</mark4><br>
It could not be the <mark5>place</mark5><br>
It is, without <mark4>blood.</mark4><br>
These hunt, as they have <mark4>done,</mark4><br>
But with claws and teeth grown <mark4>perfect,</mark4><br>
<br>
More deadly than they can believe.   <br>
They stalk more <mark4>silently,</mark4><br>
And crouch on the limbs of <mark3>trees,</mark3><br>
And their <mark4>descent</mark4><br>
Upon the bright backs of their prey <br>
<br>
May take <mark4>years</mark4><br>
In a sovereign floating of joy.   <br>
And those that are <mark4>hunted</mark4><br>
Know this as their life, <br>
Their reward: to <mark1>walk</mark1><br>
<br>
Under such trees in full <mark5>knowledge</mark5><br>
Of what is in glory above <mark4>them,</mark4><br>
And to feel no fear, <br>
But <mark4>acceptance</mark4>, <mark4>compliance.</mark4><br>
Fulfilling themselves without <mark4>pain</mark4><br>
<br>
At the cycle's <mark4>center,</mark4><br>
They tremble, they <mark1>walk</mark1><br>
Under the <mark5>tree,</mark5><br>
They fall, they are <mark4>torn,</mark4><br>
They rise, they walk <mark4>again.</mark4><br>
