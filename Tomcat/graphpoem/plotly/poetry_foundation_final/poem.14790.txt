Title : The Coming of the Plague<br>
Author : Weldon Kees<br><br>

September was when it <mark4>began.</mark4><br>
Locusts dying in the <mark4>fields</mark4>, our <mark4>dogs</mark4><br>
Silent, moving like shadows on a wall;<br>
And strange worms crawling; flies of a <mark4>kind</mark4><br>
We had never seen before; huge vineyard <mark4>moths;</mark4><br>
Badgers and snakes, abandoning<br>
Their holes in the field; the fruit gone <mark4>rotten;</mark4><br>
Queer fungi sprouting; the fields and <mark4>woods</mark4><br>
Covered with spiderwebs; black <mark4>vapors</mark4><br>
Rising from the earth - all <mark4>these,</mark4><br>
And more began that fall. Ravens flew <mark4>round</mark4><br>
The hospital in pairs. Where there was <mark4>water,</mark4><br>
We could hear the sound of beating <mark4>clothes</mark4><br>
All through the <mark4>night</mark4>, We could not <mark4>count</mark4><br>
All the miscarriages, the <mark4>quarrels</mark4>, the <mark4>jealousies.</mark4><br>
And one day in a field I saw<br>
A swarm of frogs, swollen and <mark4>hideous,</mark4><br>
Hundreds upon hundreds, sitting on each <mark4>other,</mark4><br>
Huddled together, silent, <mark4>ominous,</mark4><br>
And heard the sound of rushing <mark4>wind.</mark4><br>
